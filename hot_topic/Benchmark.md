- **[RoboMemory: A Brain-inspired Multi-memory Agentic Framework for Lifelong Learning in Physical Embodied Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01415)**  `arXiv:2508.01415`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System (hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory, long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks. RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical robots.

- **[Sem-RaDiff: Diffusion-Based 3D Radar Semantic Perception in Cluttered Agricultural Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02283)**  `arXiv:2509.02283`  `cs.RO`

  Accurate and robust environmental perception is crucial for robot autonomous navigation. While current methods typically adopt optical sensors (e.g., camera, LiDAR) as primary sensing modalities, their susceptibility to visual occlusion often leads to degraded performance or complete system failure. In this paper, we focus on agricultural scenarios where robots are exposed to the risk of onboard sensor contamination. Leveraging radar's strong penetration capability, we introduce a radar-based 3D environmental perception framework as a viable alternative. It comprises three core modules designed for dense and accurate semantic perception: 1) Parallel frame accumulation to enhance signal-to-noise ratio of radar raw data. 2) A diffusion model-based hierarchical learning framework that first filters radar sidelobe artifacts then generates fine-grained 3D semantic point clouds. 3) A specifically designed sparse 3D network optimized for processing large-scale radar raw data. We conducted extensive benchmark comparisons and experimental evaluations on a self-built dataset collected in real-world agricultural field scenes. Results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural and semantic prediction performance compared to existing methods, while simultaneously reducing computational and memory costs by 51.3% and 27.5%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach achieves complete reconstruction and accurate classification of thin structures such as poles and wires-which existing methods struggle to perceive-highlighting its potential for dense and accurate 3D radar perception.

- **[BODex: Scalable and Efficient Robotic Dexterous Grasp Synthesis Using Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16490)**  `arXiv:2412.16490`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jiayi Chen, Yubin Ke, He Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic dexterous grasping is important for interacting with the environment. To unleash the potential of data-driven models for dexterous grasping, a large-scale, high-quality dataset is essential. While gradient-based optimization offers a promising way for constructing such datasets, previous works suffer from limitations, such as inefficiency, strong assumptions in the grasp quality energy, or limited object sets for experiments. Moreover, the lack of a standard benchmark for comparing different methods and datasets hinders progress in this field. To address these challenges, we develop a highly efficient synthesis system and a comprehensive benchmark with MuJoCo for dexterous grasping. We formulate grasp synthesis as a bilevel optimization problem, combining a novel lower-level quadratic programming (QP) with an upper-level gradient descent process. By leveraging recent advances in CUDA-accelerated robotic libraries and GPU-based QP solvers, our system can parallelize thousands of grasps and synthesize over 49 grasps per second on a single 3090 GPU. Our synthesized grasps for Shadow, Allegro, and Leap hands all achieve a success rate above 75% in simulation, with a penetration depth under 1 mm, outperforming existing baselines on nearly all metrics. Compared to the previous large-scale dataset, DexGraspNet, our dataset significantly improves the performance of learning models, with a success rate from around 40% to 80% in simulation. Real-world testing of the trained model on the Shadow Hand achieves an 81% success rate across 20 diverse objects. The codes and datasets are released on our project page:this https URL.

- **[Pruning Weights but Not Truth: Safeguarding Truthfulness While Pruning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00096)**  `arXiv:2509.00096`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yao Fu, Runchao Li, Xianxuan Long, Haotian Yu, Xiaotian Han, Yu Yin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance. However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

- **[LimiX: Unleashing Structured-Data Modeling Capability for Generalist Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03505)**  `arXiv:2509.03505`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Xingxuan Zhang, Gang Ren, Han Yu, Hao Yuan, Hui Wang, Jiansheng Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

- **[Exploring Response Uncertainty in MLLMs: An Empirical Evaluation under Misleading Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02708)**  `arXiv:2411.02708`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks ranging from visual question answering to video understanding. However, existing studies have concentrated mainly on visual-textual misalignment, leaving largely unexplored the MLLMs' ability to preserve an originally correct answer when confronted with misleading information. We reveal a response uncertainty phenomenon: across nine standard datasets, twelve state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs overturn a previously correct answer in 65% of cases after receiving a single deceptive cue. To systematically quantify this vulnerability, we propose a two-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) elicit each model's original response on unperturbed inputs; (2) inject explicit (false-answer hints) and implicit (contextual contradictions) misleading instructions, and compute the misleading rate - the fraction of correct-to-incorrect flips. Leveraging the most susceptible examples, we curate the Multimodal Uncertainty Benchmark (MUB), a collection of image-question pairs stratified into low, medium, and high difficulty based on how many of twelve state-of-the-art MLLMs they mislead. Extensive evaluation on twelve open-source and five closed-source models reveals a high uncertainty: average misleading rates exceed 86%, with explicit cues over 67.19% and implicit cues over 80.67%. To reduce the misleading rate, we then fine-tune all open-source MLLMs on a compact 2000-sample mixed-instruction dataset, reducing misleading rates to 6.97% (explicit) and 32.77% (implicit), boosting consistency by nearly 29.37% on highly deceptive inputs, and slightly improving accuracy on standard benchmarks.

- **[On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03493)**  `arXiv:2509.03493`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Han Shen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

- **[Fair Resource Allocation for Fleet Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03353)**  `arXiv:2509.03353`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments, leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11% in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

- **[FoMEMO: Towards Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03244)**  `arXiv:2509.03244`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yiming Yao, Fei Liu, Liang Zhao, Xi Lin, Qingfu Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO (Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive performance compared to existing methods.

  _Xingyue Huang, Rishabh, Gregor Franke, Ziyi Yang, Jiamu Bai, Weijie Bai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1) LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness, difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available atthis https URL.

- **[Enhancing Machine Learning for Imbalanced Medical Data: A Quantum-Inspired Approach to Synthetic Oversampling (QI-SMOTE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02863)**  `arXiv:2509.02863`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Vikas Kashtriya, Pardeep Singh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML), particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA), kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML methodologies.

- **[The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575)**  `arXiv:2509.02575`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zichuan Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.

- **[A theoretical framework for self-supervised contrastive learning for continuous dependent data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09785)**  `arXiv:2506.09785`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Alexander Marusov, Aleksandr Yugay, Alexey Zaytsev_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

- **[Group-in-Group Policy Optimization for LLM Agent Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10978)**  `arXiv:2505.10978`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Lang Feng, Zhenghai Xue, Tingcong Liu, Bo An_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in group-based reinforcement learning (RL) have driven frontier large language models (LLMs) in single-turn tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, their scalability to long-horizon LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\% on ALFWorld and > 9\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As image-based deep reinforcement learning tackles more challenging tasks, increasing model size has become an important factor in improving performance. Recent studies achieved this by focusing on the parameter efficiency of scaled networks, typically using Impala-CNN, a 15-layer ResNet-inspired network, as the image encoder. However, while Impala-CNN evidently outperforms older CNN architectures, potential advancements in network design for deep reinforcement learning-specific image encoders remain largely unexplored. We find that replacing the flattening of output feature maps in Impala-CNN with global average pooling leads to a notable performance improvement. This approach outperforms larger and more complex models in the Procgen Benchmark, particularly in terms of generalization. We call our proposed encoder model Impoola-CNN. A decrease in the network's translation sensitivity may be central to this improvement, as we observe the most significant gains in games without agent-centered observations. Our results demonstrate that network scaling is not just about increasing model size - efficient network design is also an essential factor. We make our code available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size. All code and data accompanying this manuscript are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Tabular foundation model for GEOAI benchmark problems BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03191)**  `arXiv:2509.03191`  `cs.LG`  
  _Taiga Saito, Yu Otake, Stephen Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction), TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in probabilistic site characterization.

- **[LExI: Layer-Adaptive Active Experts for Efficient MoE Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02753)**  `arXiv:2509.02753`  `cs.LG`  
  _Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Sandeep Madireddy, Murali Emani, Venkatram Vishwanath_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers, resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than traditional expert pruning.

  _Cheol Woo Kim, Shresth Verma, Mauricio Tec, Milind Tambe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

- **[SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02479)**  `arXiv:2509.02479`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhenghai Xue, Longtao Zheng, Qian Liu, Yingru Li, Xiaosen Zheng, Zejun Ma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model. Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns, such as self-correction and cross-validation.

  Failure triage in design functional verification is critical but time-intensive, relying on manual specification reviews, log inspections, and waveform analyses. While machine learning (ML) has improved areas like stimulus generation and coverage closure, its application to RTL-level simulation failure triage, particularly for large designs, remains limited. VCDiag offers an efficient, adaptable approach using VCD data to classify failing waveforms and pinpoint likely failure locations. In the largest experiment, VCDiag achieves over 94% accuracy in identifying the top three most likely modules. The framework introduces a novel signal selection and statistical compression approach, achieving over 120x reduction in raw data size while preserving features essential for classification. It can also be integrated into diverse Verilog/SystemVerilog designs and testbenches.

  Federated graph learning is an emerging field with significant practical challenges. While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.

  Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  Image geolocalization, in which an AI model traditionally predicts the precise GPS coordinates of an image, is a challenging task with many downstream applications. However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their knowledge beyond the GPS coordinates; the model lacks an understanding of the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In recent days, with the tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) -- proprietary and open-source -- researchers have attempted to geolocalize images via LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for more specialized downstream tasks, such as geolocalization, LMMs struggle. In this work, we propose solving this problem by introducing a conversational model, GAEA, that provides information regarding the location of an image as the user requires. No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model exists. Thus, we propose GAEA-1.4M, a comprehensive dataset comprising over 800k images and approximately 1.4M question-answer pairs, constructed by leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark, GAEA-Bench, comprising 3.5k image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse question types. We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source model, LLaVA-OneVision, by 18.2% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o, by 7.2%.

  Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model's ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods.

  Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

  Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings, thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1, Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably, our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios. Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy) substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical AI systems.

  CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

  Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, while existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel, unified, and highly generalizable framework that goes beyond traditional binary classification, providing detailed, textual reasoning for its predictions. Distinct from conventional methods, TruthLens performs MLLM grounding.TruthLens uses a task-driven representation integration strategy that unites global semantic context from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with region-specific forensic cues through explicit cross-modal adaptation of a vision-only model. This enables nuanced, region-grounded reasoning for both face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, and supports fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"- capabilities beyond pretrained MLLMs alone. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens sets a new benchmark in both forensic interpretability and detection accuracy, generalizing to seen and unseen manipulations alike. By unifying high-level scene understanding with fine-grained region grounding, TruthLens delivers transparent DeepFake forensics, bridging a critical gap in the literature.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile, these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive, inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

  Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

  We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

  Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our proposed CLIP-based Fr√©chet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for deployment on edge devices in practice.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images. Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark and associated materials are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation, connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve.

  Bangla language consists of fifty distinct characters and many compound characters. Several notable studies have been performed to recognize Bangla characters, both handwritten and optical. Our approach uses transfer learning to classify the basic, distinct, as well as compound Bangla handwritten characters while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. Deep Neural Network techniques such as 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN), Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and MobileNet are applied to generate an end-to-end classification of all possible standard formations of handwritten characters in the Bangla language. The Bangla Lekha Isolated dataset, which contains 166,105 Bangla character image samples categorized into 84 distinct classes, is used for this classification model. The model achieved 99.82% accuracy on training data and 99.46% accuracy on test data. Comparisons with various state-of-the-art benchmarks of Bangla handwritten character classification show that the proposed model achieves better accuracy in classifying the data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules, yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy. Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues. Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models. Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols, including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS, PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67). Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes, underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for next-generation computational pathology.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark, MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench. Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within videos.

  Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation.

  Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge, existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored, making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent, an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

  Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

  We describe a publicly available multimodal dataset of annotated Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) studies for head and neck cancer research. The dataset includes 1123 FDG-PET/CT studies from patients with histologically confirmed head and neck cancer, acquired from 10 international medical centers. All examinations consisted of co-registered PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical diversity across institutions. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists and radiologists following standardized guidelines and quality control measures. We provide anonymized NifTi files of all studies, along with expert-annotated segmentation masks, radiotherapy dose distribution for a subset of patients, and comprehensive clinical metadata. This metadata includes TNM staging, HPV status, demographics (age and gender), long-term follow-up outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. We demonstrate how this dataset can be used for three key clinical tasks: automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV status classification, providing benchmark results using state-of-the-art deep learning models, including UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic frameworks.

  This report presents an overview of the AIM 2025 RipSeg Challenge, a competition designed to advance techniques for automatic rip current segmentation in still images. Rip currents are dangerous, fast-moving flows that pose a major risk to beach safety worldwide, making accurate visual detection an important and underexplored research task. The challenge builds on RipVIS, the largest available rip current dataset, and focuses on single-class instance segmentation, where precise delineation is critical to fully capture the extent of rip currents. The dataset spans diverse locations, rip current types, and camera orientations, providing a realistic and challenging benchmark.In total, $75$ participants registered for this first edition, resulting in $5$ valid test submissions. Teams were evaluated on a composite score combining $F_1$, $F_2$, $AP_{50}$, and $AP_{[50:95]}$, ensuring robust and application-relevant rankings. The top-performing methods leveraged deep learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse conditions.This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons learned from the submissions, and future directions for expanding RipSeg.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows, where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy, which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios.

  _Jianfei Zhao, Feng Zhang, Xin Sun, Chong Feng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

  Discovering customer intentions is crucial for automated service agents, yet existing intent clustering methods often fall short due to their reliance on embedding distance metrics and neglect of underlying semantic structures. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the language understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) examines the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) introduces context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. Since existing English benchmarks lack sufficient semantic diversity and intent coverage, we further present a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset comprising over 100k real customer service calls with 1,507 human-annotated clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable improvements in clustering quality, cost efficiency, and downstream applications. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the prominence of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable dialogue data mining.

  Assistants on assembly tasks have a large potential to benefit humans from everyday tasks to industrial settings. However, no testbeds support application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types. Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity assistants.

  Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable visual and linguistic capabilities, achieving impressive performance in various tasks such as image recognition and object localization. However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance and being easily affected by the stroop effect introduced by textual information. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present an end-to-end, self-evolving adversarial workflow for long-context Question-Answer (QA) Generation in Arabic. By orchestrating multiple specialized LVLMs: a question generator, an evaluator, and a swarm of answer generators, our system iteratively refines its own performance without any human intervention. Starting from raw, multi-page Arabic documents across diverse domains, the question generator produces fine-grained, context-aware queries to be tackled by the answer generator swarm, and the evaluator assesses and feeds back quality metrics. This closed-loop cycle enables continuous learning: low-confidence outputs trigger automated re-generation and model updates, progressively enhancing question difficulty and relevance. Moreover, we set the quality metrics as a tunable hyperparameter, enabling question generation at controllable and customizable difficulty levels. We release AraLongBench, a large-scale Arabic benchmark of single- and multi-page challenges spanning hundreds of pages, and demonstrate that our self-evolving workflow substantially outperform static pipelines, markedly boosting the long-context comprehension capabilities of leading Arabic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Lastly, we also meticulously architect a fully automated agentic workflow for long-context Arabic document collection.

  This paper introduces DrDiff, a novel framework for long-text generation that overcomes the efficiency-quality trade-off through three core technologies. First, we design a dynamic expert scheduling mechanism that intelligently allocates computational resources during the diffusion process based on text complexity, enabling more efficient handling of text generation tasks of varying difficulty. Second, we introduce a Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA) mechanism that adaptively adjusts attention patterns according to a variety of input lengths, reducing computational complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$) while maintaining model performance. Finally, we propose a soft absorption guidance optimization strategy that combines with DPM-solver++ to reduce diffusion steps, significantly improving generation speed. Comprehensive experiments on various long-text generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our DrDiff over the existing SOTA methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper defines and explores the design space for information extraction (IE) from layout-rich documents using large language models (LLMs). The three core challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model engagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems and methods within these core challenges, such as input representation, chunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the effect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source, layout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE models. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the IE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration found with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice baseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working configuration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves near-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best full factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation. Overall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match the performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective, finetuning-free alternative.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) has enabled the training of multilingual large language models (LLMs) on diverse and decentralized multilingual data, especially on low-resource languages. To improve client-specific performance, personalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules such as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as the design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs and what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for fine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a federated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device FL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are prone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the optimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank selection. Evaluations on both simulated and real-world multilingual FL benchmarks demonstrate that FedP$^2$EFT largely outperforms existing personalized fine-tuning methods, while complementing other existing FL methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination has emerged as a significant barrier to the effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Guided SElf-Reflection (AGSER) approach for zero-shot hallucination detection in LLMs. The AGSER method utilizes attention contributions to categorize the input query into attentive and non-attentive queries. Each query is then processed separately through the LLMs, allowing us to compute consistency scores between the generated responses and the original answer. The difference between the two consistency scores serves as a hallucination estimator. In addition to its efficacy in detecting hallucinations, AGSER notably reduces computational overhead, requiring only three passes through the LLM and utilizing two sets of tokens. We have conducted extensive experiments with four widely-used LLMs across three different hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot hallucination detection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, they face increasingly diverse and complex tasks, making reliable evaluation challenging. The paradigm of LLMs as judges has emerged as a scalable solution, yet prior work primarily focuses on simple settings. Their reliability in complex tasks--where multi-faceted rubrics, unstructured reference answers, and nuanced criteria are critical--remains understudied. In this paper, we constructed ComplexEval, a challenge benchmark designed to systematically expose and quantify Auxiliary Information Induced Biases. We systematically investigated and validated 6 previously unexplored biases across 12 basic and 3 advanced scenarios. Key findings reveal: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant susceptibility to these biases, with bias magnitude scaling with task complexity; (2) notably, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) show paradoxical vulnerability. Our in-depth analysis offers crucial insights for improving the accuracy and verifiability of evaluation signals, paving the way for more general and robust evaluation models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete. To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks. Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance, and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their evaluation has predominantly focused on global or anglocentric subjects, often neglecting low-resource languages and culturally specific content. While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.

  The Romansh language, spoken in Switzerland, has limited resources for machine translation evaluation. In this paper, we present a benchmark for six varieties of Romansh: Rumantsch Grischun, a supra-regional variety, and five regional varieties: Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter, and Vallader. Our reference translations were created by human translators based on the WMT24++ benchmark, which ensures parallelism with more than 55 other languages. An automatic evaluation of existing MT systems and LLMs shows that translation out of Romansh into German is handled relatively well for all the varieties, but translation into Romansh is still challenging.

  Psychotherapy reaches only a small fraction of individuals suffering from mental disorders due to social stigma and the limited availability of therapists. Large language models (LLMs), when equipped with professional psychotherapeutic skills, offer a promising solution to expand access to mental health services. However, the lack of psychological conversation datasets presents significant challenges in developing effective psychotherapy-guided conversational agents. In this paper, we construct a long-periodic dialogue corpus for counseling based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Our curated dataset includes multiple sessions for each counseling and incorporates cognitive conceptualization diagrams (CCDs) to guide client simulation across diverse scenarios. To evaluate the utility of our dataset, we train an in-depth counseling model and present a comprehensive evaluation framework to benchmark it against established psychological criteria for CBT-based counseling. Results demonstrate that DiaCBT effectively enhances LLMs' ability to emulate psychologists with CBT expertise, underscoring its potential for training more professional counseling agents.

  Individuals from sexual and gender minority groups experience disproportionately high rates of poor health outcomes and mental disorders compared to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts, largely as a consequence of minority stress as described by Meyer's (2003) model. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based architectures for detecting minority stress in online discourse. We benchmark multiple transformer models including ELECTRA, BERT, RoBERTa, and BART against traditional machine learning baselines and graph-augmented variants. We further assess zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms to assess their applicability on underrepresented datasets. Experiments are conducted on the two largest publicly available Reddit corpora for minority stress detection, comprising 12,645 and 5,789 posts, and are repeated over five random seeds to ensure robustness. Our results demonstrate that integrating graph structure consistently improves detection performance across transformer-only models and that supervised fine-tuning with relational context outperforms zero and few-shot approaches. Theoretical analysis reveals that modeling social connectivity and conversational context via graph augmentation sharpens the models' ability to identify key linguistic markers such as identity concealment, internalized stigma, and calls for support, suggesting that graph-enhanced transformers offer the most reliable foundation for digital health interventions and public health policy.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.

  Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language models, but their reliance on softmax attention poses a computational bottleneck at both training and inference. Recurrent models offer high efficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic representation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits fine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design that bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions the input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local dependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range interactions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct access to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency. Empirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement in training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K position, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but also consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Chinese LLMs underscores the need for vertical-domain evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However, existing benchmarks often lack domain coverage and provide limited insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a unified framework for expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical domains, drawn from 24 Chinese qualifications to align with national policies and professional standards. Results reveal an interesting pattern of Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, with the Qwen2.5 model outperforming the more advanced GPT-4o, emphasizing the value of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements. The average accuracy of 53.98% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage within model capabilities. Furthermore, we identify performance degradation caused by LLM crowdsourcing, assess data contamination, and illustrate the effectiveness of prompt engineering and model fine-tuning, suggesting opportunities for future improvements through multi-domain RAG and Federated Learning.

  The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.

  Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety. Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM, with one ranking 6th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities. For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available on our website atthis https URL. AHELM is intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added over time.

  We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on given seed tasks, and then generate a new synthetic example of similar quality and complexity. This is followed by a filtering step to select high-quality data using automatic metrics, which are then used for LLM training. In verifiable reasoning, our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as s1k and OpenMathReasoning, when evaluated on MATH500, AMC23, AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond. For non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the performance of both human and standard Self-Instruct training data on the AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

  Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH. We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation, this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions. The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition, commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding, pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving. Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and achieve competitive results.

  Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

  We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve these improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

  The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents. These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks, including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies, and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is available at: {this https URL}.

  Explanation generation frameworks aim to make AI systems' decisions transparent and understandable to human users. However, generating explanations in uncertain environments characterized by incomplete information and probabilistic models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating probabilistic monolithic explanations and model reconciling explanations. Monolithic explanations provide self-contained reasons for an explanandum without considering the agent receiving the explanation, while model reconciling explanations account for the knowledge of the agent receiving the explanation. For monolithic explanations, our approach integrates uncertainty by utilizing probabilistic logic to increase the probability of the explanandum. For model reconciling explanations, we propose a framework that extends the logic-based variant of the model reconciliation problem to account for probabilistic human models, where the goal is to find explanations that increase the probability of the explanandum while minimizing conflicts between the explanation and the probabilistic human model. We introduce explanatory gain and explanatory power as quantitative metrics to assess the quality of these explanations. Further, we present algorithms that exploit the duality between minimal correction sets and minimal unsatisfiable sets to efficiently compute both types of explanations in probabilistic contexts. Extensive experimental evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in generating explanations under uncertainty.
