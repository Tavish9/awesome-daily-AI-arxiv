- **[Learning to Build: Autonomous Robotic Assembly of Stable Structures Without Predefined Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23934)**  `arXiv:2602.23934`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Jingwen Wang, Johannes Kirschner, Paul Rolland, Luis Salamanca, Stefana Parascho_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel autonomous robotic assembly framework for constructing stable structures without relying on predefined architectural blueprints. Instead of following fixed plans, construction tasks are defined through targets and obstacles, allowing the system to adapt more flexibly to environmental uncertainty and variations during the building process. A reinforcement learning (RL) policy, trained using deep Q-learning with successor features, serves as the decision-making component. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the approach on a benchmark of 15 2D robotic assembly tasks of discrete block construction. Experiments using a real-world closed-loop robotic setup demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to handle construction noise. The results suggest that our framework offers a promising direction for more adaptable and robust robotic construction in real-world environments.

- **[Apple: Toward General Active Perception via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06182)**  `arXiv:2505.06182`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Tim Schneider, Cristiana de Farias, Roberto Calandra, Liming Chen, Jan Peters_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active perception is a fundamental skill that enables us humans to deal with uncertainty in our inherently partially observable environment. For senses such as touch, where the information is sparse and local, active perception becomes crucial. In recent years, active perception has emerged as an important research domain in robotics. However, current methods are often bound to specific tasks or make strong assumptions, which limit their generality. To address this gap, this work introduces APPLE (Active Perception Policy Learning) - a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to address a range of different active perception problems. APPLE jointly trains a transformer-based perception module and decision-making policy with a unified optimization objective, learning how to actively gather information. By design, APPLE is not limited to a specific task and can, in principle, be applied to a wide range of active perception problems. We evaluate two variants of APPLE across different tasks, including tactile exploration problems from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of APPLE, achieving high accuracies on both regression and classification tasks. These findings underscore the potential of APPLE as a versatile and general framework for advancing active perception in robotics.Project page:this https URL

- **[Enhancing Vision-Language Navigation with Multimodal Event Knowledge from Real-World Indoor Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23937)**  `arXiv:2602.23937`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Haoxuan Xu, Tianfu Li, Wenbo Chen, Yi Liu, Xingxing Zuo, Yaoxian Song, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents often struggle with long-horizon reasoning in unseen environments, particularly when facing ambiguous, coarse-grained instructions. While recent advances use knowledge graph to enhance reasoning, the potential of multimodal event knowledge inspired by human episodic memory remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an event-centric knowledge enhancement strategy for automated process knowledge mining and feature fusion to solve coarse-grained instruction and long-horizon reasoning in VLN task. First, we construct YE-KG, the first large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal knowledge graph, with over 86k nodes and 83k edges, derived from real-world indoor videos. By leveraging multimodal large language models (i.e., LLaVa, GPT4), we extract unstructured video streams into structured semantic-action-effect events to serve as explicit episodic memory. Second, we introduce STE-VLN, which integrates the above graph into VLN models via a Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Retrieval mechanism. This allows agents to retrieve causal event sequences and dynamically fuse them with egocentric visual observations. Experiments on REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our event-centric strategy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across diverse action spaces. Our data and code are available on the project websitethis https URL.

- **[StemVLA:An Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Model with Future 3D Spatial Geometry Knowledge and 4D Historical Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23721)**  `arXiv:2602.23721`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Jiasong Xiao, Yutao She, Kai Li, Yuyang Sha, Ziang Cheng, Ziang Tong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate visual observations and language instructions to predict robot actions, demonstrating promising generalization in manipulation tasks. However, most existing approaches primarily rely on direct mappings from 2D visual inputs to action sequences, without explicitly modeling the underlying 3D spatial structure or temporal world dynamics. Such representations may limit spatial reasoning and long-horizon decision-making in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we propose StemVLA, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates both future-oriented 3D spatial knowledge and historical 4D spatiotemporal representations into action prediction. First, instead of relying solely on observed images, StemVLA forecasts structured 3D future spatial-geometric world knowledge, enabling the model to anticipate upcoming scene geometry and object configurations. Second, to capture temporal consistency and motion dynamics, we feed historical image frames into a pretrained video-geometry transformer backbone to extract implicit 3D world representations, and further aggregate them across time using a temporal attention module, termed VideoFormer [20], forming a unified 4D historical spatiotemporal representation. By jointly modeling 2D observations, predicted 3D future structure, and aggregated 4D temporal dynamics, StemVLA enables more comprehensive world understanding for robot manipulation. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that StemVLA significantly improves long-horizon task success and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmark [46], achieving an average sequence length of XXX.

- **[SafeGen-LLM: Enhancing Safety Generalization in Task Planning for Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24235)**  `arXiv:2602.24235`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jialiang Fan, Weizhe Xu, Mengyu Liu, Oleg Sokolsky, Insup Lee, Fangxin Kong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety-critical task planning in robotic systems remains challenging: classical planners suffer from poor scalability, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods generalize poorly, and base Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot guarantee safety. To address this gap, we propose safety-generalizable large language models, named SafeGen-LLM. SafeGen-LLM can not only enhance the safety satisfaction of task plans but also generalize well to novel safety properties in various domains. We first construct a multi-domain Planning Domain Definition Language 3 (PDDL3) benchmark with explicit safety constraints. Then, we introduce a two-stage post-training framework: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a constraint-compliant planning dataset to learn planning syntax and semantics, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by fine-grained reward machines derived from formal verification to enforce safety alignment and by curriculum learning to better handle complex tasks. Extensive experiments show that SafeGen-LLM achieves strong safety generalization and outperforms frontier proprietary baselines across multi-domain planning tasks and multiple input formats (e.g., PDDLs and natural language).

- **[TaCarla: A comprehensive benchmarking dataset for end-to-end autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23499)**  `arXiv:2602.23499`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collecting a high-quality dataset is a critical task that demands meticulous attention to detail, as overlooking certain aspects can render the entire dataset unusable. Autonomous driving challenges remain a prominent area of research, requiring further exploration to enhance the perception and planning performance of vehicles. However, existing datasets are often incomplete. For instance, datasets that include perception information generally lack planning data, while planning datasets typically consist of extensive driving sequences where the ego vehicle predominantly drives forward, offering limited behavioral diversity. In addition, many real datasets struggle to evaluate their models, especially for planning tasks, since they lack a proper closed-loop evaluation setup. The CARLA Leaderboard 2.0 challenge, which provides a diverse set of scenarios to address the long-tail problem in autonomous driving, has emerged as a valuable alternative platform for developing perception and planning models in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluation setups. Nevertheless, existing datasets collected on this platform present certain limitations. Some datasets appear to be tailored primarily for limited sensor configuration, with particular sensor configurations. To support end-to-end autonomous driving research, we have collected a new dataset comprising over 2.85 million frames using the CARLA simulation environment for the diverse Leaderboard 2.0 challenge scenarios. Our dataset is designed not only for planning tasks but also supports dynamic object detection, lane divider detection, centerline detection, traffic light recognition, prediction tasks and visual language action models . Furthermore, we demonstrate its versatility by training various models using our dataset. Moreover, we also provide numerical rarity scores to understand how rarely the current state occurs in the dataset.

- **[Actor-Critic for Continuous Action Chunks: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation with Sparse Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11143)**  `arXiv:2508.11143`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiarui Yang, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Yu-Gang Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those involving sparse rewards. While action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks, validating its effective design.

- **[Robust Skills, Brittle Grounding: Diagnosing Restricted Generalization in Vision-Language Action Policies via Multi-Object Picking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24143)**  `arXiv:2602.24143`  `cs.RO`  
  _David Emukpere, Romain Deffayet, Jean-Michel Renders_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language action (VLA) policies often report strong manipulation benchmark performance with relatively few demonstrations, but it remains unclear whether this reflects robust language-to-object grounding or reliance on object--location correlations that do not transfer beyond the training distribution. We present a controlled multi-object picking study that progressively increases object placement variability up to full workspace randomization and evaluates held-out object--location pairings that break familiar associations without increasing spatial difficulty. Across these stress tests and data scaling, we find that for representative VLA policies, including SmolVLA and $\pi_{0.5}$, execution of the manipulation primitive remains substantially more reliable than instruction-conditioned task success in harder regimes, suggesting that manipulation skill acquisition is decoupled from instruction following. We recommend augmenting manipulation benchmarks with task ladders and decomposed metrics that separately measure primitive execution and instruction-conditioned success to better diagnose instruction-grounded generalization.

- **[Acceleration-Based Control of Fixed-Wing UAVs for Guidance Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23821)**  `arXiv:2602.23821`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jixiang Wang, Siyuan Yang, Ziyi Wu, Siqi Wei, Ashay Wakode, Agata Barcis, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Acceleration-commanded guidance laws (e.g., proportional navigation) are attractive for high-level decision making, but their direct deployment on fixed-wing UAVs is challenging because accelerations are not directly actuated and must be realized through attitude and thrust under flight-envelope constraints. This paper presents an acceleration-level outer-loop control framework that converts commanded tangential and normal accelerations into executable body-rate and normalized thrust commands compatible with mainstream autopilots (e.g., PX4/APM). For the normal channel, we derive an engineering mapping from the desired normal acceleration to roll- and pitch-rate commands that regulate the direction and magnitude of the lift vector under small-angle assumptions. For the tangential channel, we introduce an energy-based formulation inspired by total energy control and identify an empirical thrust-energy acceleration relationship directly from flight data, avoiding explicit propulsion modeling or thrust bench calibration. We further discuss priority handling between normal and tangential accelerations under saturation and non-level maneuvers. Extensive real-flight experiments on a VTOL fixed-wing platform demonstrate accurate acceleration tracking and enable practical implementation of proportional navigation using only body-rate and normalized thrust interfaces.

- **[DAGS-SLAM: Dynamic-Aware 3DGS SLAM via Spatiotemporal Motion Probability and Uncertainty-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21644)**  `arXiv:2602.21644`  `cs.RO`  
  _Li Zhang, Yu-An Liu, Xijia Jiang, Conghao Huang, Danyang Li, Yanyong Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile robots and IoT devices demand real-time localization and dense reconstruction under tight compute and energy budgets. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dense SLAM, dynamic objects and occlusions still degrade tracking and mapping. Existing dynamic 3DGS-SLAM often relies on heavy optical flow and per-frame segmentation, which is costly for mobile deployment and brittle under challenging illumination. We present DAGS-SLAM, a dynamic-aware 3DGS-SLAM system that maintains a spatiotemporal motion probability (MP) state per Gaussian and triggers semantics on demand via an uncertainty-aware scheduler. DAGS-SLAM fuses lightweight YOLO instance priors with geometric cues to estimate and temporally update MP, propagates MP to the front-end for dynamic-aware correspondence selection, and suppresses dynamic artifacts in the back-end via MP-guided optimization. Experiments on public dynamic RGB-D benchmarks show improved reconstruction and robust tracking while sustaining real-time throughput on a commodity GPU, demonstrating a practical speed-accuracy tradeoff with reduced semantic invocations toward mobile deployment.

- **[HALO: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Embodied Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21157)**  `arXiv:2602.21157`  `cs.RO`  
  _Quanxin Shou, Fangqi Zhu, Shawn Chen, Puxin Yan, Zhengyang Yan, Yikun Miao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong performance in robotic manipulation, but often struggle in long-horizon or out-of-distribution scenarios due to the lack of explicit mechanisms for multimodal reasoning and anticipating how the world will evolve under action. Recent works introduce textual chain-of-thought or visual subgoal prediction within VLA models to reason, but still fail to offer a unified human-like reasoning framework for joint textual reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction. To this end, we propose HALO, a unified VLA model that enables embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning through a sequential process of textual task reasoning, visual subgoal prediction for fine-grained guidance, and EM-CoT-augmented action prediction. We instantiate HALO with a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture that decouples semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction into specialized experts while allowing seamless cross-expert collaboration. To enable HALO learning at scale, we introduce an automated pipeline to synthesize EM-CoT training data along with a carefully crafted training recipe. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) HALO achieves superior performance in both simulated and real-world environments, surpassing baseline policy pi_0 by 34.1% on RoboTwin benchmark; (2) all proposed components of the training recipe and EM-CoT design help improve task success rate; and (3) HALO exhibits strong generalization capabilities under aggressive unseen environmental randomization with our proposed EM-CoT reasoning.

- **[Histopathology Image Normalization via Latent Manifold Compaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.24251)**  `arXiv:2602.24251`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Xiaolong Zhang, Jianwei Zhang, Selim Sevim, Emek Demir, Ece Eksi, Xubo Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Batch effects arising from technical variations in histopathology staining protocols, scanners, and acquisition pipelines pose a persistent challenge for computational pathology, hindering cross-batch generalization and limiting reliable deployment of models across clinical sites. In this work, we introduce Latent Manifold Compaction (LMC), an unsupervised representation learning framework that performs image harmonization by learning batch-invariant embeddings from a single source dataset through explicit compaction of stain-induced latent manifolds. This allows LMC to generalize to target domain data unseen during training. Evaluated on three challenging public and in-house benchmarks, LMC substantially reduces batch-induced separations across multiple datasets and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art normalization methods in downstream cross-batch classification and detection tasks, enabling superior generalization.

  Optical design is the process of configuring optical elements to precisely manipulate light for high-fidelity imaging. It is inherently a highly non-convex optimization problem that relies heavily on human heuristic expertise and domain-specific knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive optical knowledge, their capabilities in leveraging the knowledge in designing lens system remain significantly constrained. This work represents the first attempt to employ LLMs in the field of optical design. We bridge the expertise gap by enabling users without formal optical training to successfully develop functional lens systems. Concretely, we curate a comprehensive dataset, named OptiDesignQA, which encompasses both classical lens systems sourced from standard optical textbooks and novel configurations generated by automated design algorithms for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we inject domain-specific optical expertise into the LLM through a hybrid objective of full-system synthesis and lens completion. To align the model with optical principles, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization Done Right (DrGRPO) guided by Optical Lexicographic Reward for physics-driven policy alignment. This reward system incorporates structural format rewards, physical feasibility rewards, light-manipulation accuracy, and LLM-based heuristics. Finally, our model integrates with specialized optical optimization routines for end-to-end fine-tuning and precision refinement. We benchmark our proposed method against both traditional optimization-based automated design algorithms and LLM counterparts, and experimental results show the superiority of our method.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many emerging agentic paradigms require agents to collaborate with one another (or people) to achieve shared goals. Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.

  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing their private data. However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562)**  `arXiv:2509.22562`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Lute Lillo, Nick Cheney_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

  GPU kernel optimization is fundamental to modern deep learning but remains a highly specialized task requiring deep hardware expertise. Despite strong performance in general programming, large language models (LLMs) remain uncompetitive with compiler-based systems such asthis http URLfor CUDA kernel generation. Existing CUDA code generation approaches either rely on training-free refinement or fine-tune models within fixed multi-turn execution-feedback loops, but both paradigms fail to fundamentally improve the model's intrinsic CUDA optimization ability, resulting in limited performance gains. We present CUDA Agent, a large-scale agentic reinforcement learning system that develops CUDA kernel expertise through three components: a scalable data synthesis pipeline, a skill-augmented CUDA development environment with automated verification and profiling to provide reliable reward signals, and reinforcement learning algorithmic techniques enabling stable training. CUDA Agent achieves state-of-the-art results on KernelBench, delivering 100\%, 100\%, and 92\% faster rate overthis http URLon KernelBench Level-1, Level-2, and Level-3 splits, outperforming the strongest proprietary models such as Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro by about 40\% on the hardest Level-3 setting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world data frequently exhibit latent hierarchical structures, which can be naturally represented by hyperbolic geometry. Although recent hyperbolic neural networks have demonstrated promising results, many existing architectures remain partially intrinsic, mixing Euclidean operations with hyperbolic ones or relying on extrinsic parameterizations. To address it, we propose the \emph{Intrinsic Lorentz Neural Network} (ILNN), a fully intrinsic hyperbolic architecture that conducts all computations within the Lorentz model. At its core, the network introduces a novel \emph{point-to-hyperplane} fully connected layer (FC), replacing traditional Euclidean affine logits with closed-form hyperbolic distances from features to learned Lorentz hyperplanes, thereby ensuring that the resulting geometric decision functions respect the inherent curvature. Around this fundamental layer, we design intrinsic modules: GyroLBN, a Lorentz batch normalization that couples gyro-centering with gyro-scaling, consistently outperforming both LBN and GyroBN while reducing training time. We additionally proposed a gyro-additive bias for the FC output, a Lorentz patch-concatenation operator that aligns the expected log-radius across feature blocks via a digamma-based scale, and a Lorentz dropout layer. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10/100 and two genomic benchmarks (TEB and GUE) illustrate that ILNN achieves state-of-the-art performance and computational cost among hyperbolic models and consistently surpasses strong Euclidean baselines. The code is available at \href{this https URL}{\textcolor{magenta}{this url}}.

- **[Learning to maintain safety through expert demonstrations in settings with unknown constraints: A Q-learning perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23816)**  `arXiv:2602.23816`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _George Papadopoulos, George A. Vouros_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given a set of trajectories demonstrating the execution of a task safely in a constrained MDP with observable rewards but with unknown constraints and non-observable costs, we aim to find a policy that maximizes the likelihood of demonstrated trajectories trading the balance between being conservative and increasing significantly the likelihood of high-rewarding trajectories but with potentially unsafe steps. Having these objectives, we aim towards learning a policy that maximizes the probability of the most $promising$ trajectories with respect to the demonstrations. In so doing, we formulate the ``promise" of individual state-action pairs in terms of $Q$ values, which depend on task-specific rewards as well as on the assessment of states' safety, mixing expectations in terms of rewards and safety. This entails a safe Q-learning perspective of the inverse learning problem under constraints: The devised Safe $Q$ Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (SafeQIL) algorithm is compared to state-of-the art inverse constraint reinforcement learning algorithms to a set of challenging benchmark tasks, showing its merits.

- **[Bridging Dynamics Gaps via Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23737)**  `arXiv:2602.23737`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hanping Zhang, Yuhong Guo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-domain reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn transferable policies under dynamics shifts between source and target domains. A key challenge lies in the lack of target-domain environment interaction and reward supervision, which prevents direct policy learning. To address this challenge, we propose Bridging Dynamics Gaps for Cross-Domain Reinforcement Learning (BDGxRL), a novel framework that leverages Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (DSB) to align source transitions with target-domain dynamics encoded in offline demonstrations. Moreover, we introduce a reward modulation mechanism that estimates rewards based on state transitions, applying to DSB-aligned samples to ensure consistency between rewards and target-domain dynamics. BDGxRL performs target-oriented policy learning entirely within the source domain, without access to the target environment or its rewards. Experiments on MuJoCo cross-domain benchmarks demonstrate that BDGxRL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and shows strong adaptability under transition dynamics shifts.

- **[FlexGuard: Continuous Risk Scoring for Strictness-Adaptive LLM Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23636)**  `arXiv:2602.23636`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhihao Ding, Jinming Li, Ze Lu, Jieming Shi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring the safety of LLM-generated content is essential for real-world deployment. Most existing guardrail models formulate moderation as a fixed binary classification task, implicitly assuming a fixed definition of harmfulness. In practice, enforcement strictness - how conservatively harmfulness is defined and enforced - varies across platforms and evolves over time, making binary moderators brittle under shifting requirements. We first introduce FlexBench, a strictness-adaptive LLM moderation benchmark that enables controlled evaluation under multiple strictness regimes. Experiments on FlexBench reveal substantial cross-strictness inconsistency in existing moderators: models that perform well under one regime can degrade substantially under others, limiting their practical usability. To address this, we propose FlexGuard, an LLM-based moderator that outputs a calibrated continuous risk score reflecting risk severity and supports strictness-specific decisions via thresholding. We train FlexGuard via risk-alignment optimization to improve score-severity consistency and provide practical threshold selection strategies to adapt to target strictness at deployment. Experiments on FlexBench and public benchmarks demonstrate that FlexGuard achieves higher moderation accuracy and substantially improved robustness under varying strictness. We release the source code and data to support reproducibility.

  _Kejing Yin, Haizhou Xu, Wenfang Yao, Chen Liu, Zijie Chen, Yui Haang Cheung, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning holds promise for advancing clinical decision support, yet it remains unclear when multimodal learning truly helps in practice, particularly under modality missingness and fairness constraints. In this work, we conduct a systematic benchmark of multimodal fusion between Electronic Health Records (EHR) and chest X-rays (CXR) on standardized cohorts from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR, aiming to answer four fundamental questions: when multimodal fusion improves clinical prediction, how different fusion strategies compare, how robust existing methods are to missing modalities, and whether multimodal models achieve algorithmic fairness. Our study reveals several key insights. Multimodal fusion improves performance when modalities are complete, with gains concentrating in diseases that require complementary information from both EHR and CXR. While cross-modal learning mechanisms capture clinically meaningful dependencies beyond simple concatenation, the rich temporal structure of EHR introduces strong modality imbalance that architectural complexity alone cannot overcome. Under realistic missingness, multimodal benefits rapidly degrade unless models are explicitly designed to handle incomplete inputs. Moreover, multimodal fusion does not inherently improve fairness, with subgroup disparities mainly arising from unequal sensitivity across demographic groups. To support reproducible and extensible evaluation, we further release a flexible benchmarking toolkit that enables plug-and-play integration of new models and datasets. Together, this work provides actionable guidance on when multimodal learning helps, when it fails, and why, laying the foundation for developing clinically deployable multimodal systems that are both effective and reliable.

  _Alejandro Rodriguez Dominguez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are trained primarily on human-generated data and feedback, yet they exhibit persistent errors arising from annotation noise, subjective preferences, and the limited expressive bandwidth of natural language. We argue that these limitations reflect structural properties of the supervision channel rather than model scale or optimization. We develop a unified theory showing that whenever the human supervision channel is not sufficient for a latent evaluation target, it acts as an information-reducing channel that induces a strictly positive excess-risk floor for any learner dominated by it. We formalize this Human-Bounded Intelligence limit and show that across six complementary frameworks (operator theory, PAC-Bayes, information theory, causal inference, category theory, and game-theoretic analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback), non-sufficiency yields strictly positive lower bounds arising from the same structural decomposition into annotation noise, preference distortion, and semantic compression. The theory explains why scaling alone cannot eliminate persistent human-aligned errors and characterizes conditions under which auxiliary non-human signals (e.g., retrieval, program execution, tools) increase effective supervision capacity and collapse the floor by restoring information about the latent target. Experiments on real preference data, synthetic known-target tasks, and externally verifiable benchmarks confirm the predicted structural signatures: human-only supervision exhibits a persistent floor, while sufficiently informative auxiliary channels strictly reduce or eliminate excess error.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI evaluation has primarily focused on measuring capabilities, with formal approaches inspired from Item Response Theory (IRT) being increasingly applied. Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an "ideal band". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.

  _Yisheng Zhong, Zhengbang Yang, Zhuangdi Zhu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM unlearning is a technique to remove the impacts of undesirable knowledge from the model without retraining from scratch, which is indispensable towards trustworthy AI. Existing unlearning methods face significant limitations: conventional tuning-based unlearning is computationally heavy and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, in-contextualized unlearning is lightweight for precise unlearning but vulnerable to prompt removal or reverse engineering attacks. In response, we propose Distilled Unlearning from an Efficient Teacher (DUET), a novel distillation-based unlearning method that combines the merits of these two lines of work. It learns a student model to imitate the behavior of a prompt-steered teacher that effectively refuses undesirable knowledge generation while preserving general domain knowledge. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks with our enriched evaluation protocols demonstrate that DUET achieves higher performance in both forgetting and utility preservation, while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient than state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world. We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model, GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4\pm2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research assistants and tutors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models, especially diffusion and flow-based models, have been promising in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, integrating powerful generative models into this framework poses unique challenges. In particular, diffusion and flow-based policies suffer from low sampling efficiency due to their iterative generation processes, making them impractical in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. To tackle these difficulties, we propose OM2P (Offline Multi-Agent Mean-Flow Policy), a novel offline MARL algorithm to achieve efficient one-step action sampling. To address the misalignment between generative objectives and reward maximization, we introduce a reward-aware optimization scheme that integrates a carefully-designed mean-flow matching loss with Q-function supervision. Additionally, we design a generalized timestep distribution and a derivative-free estimation strategy to reduce memory overhead and improve training stability. Empirical evaluations on Multi-Agent Particle and MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that OM2P achieves superior performance, with up to a 3.8x reduction in GPU memory usage and up to a 10.8x speed-up in training time. Our approach represents the first to successfully integrate mean-flow model into offline MARL, paving the way for practical and scalable generative policies in cooperative multi-agent settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but optimizing LLM-based agentic systems remains challenging due to the vast search space of agent configurations, prompting strategies, and communication patterns. Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three domains show that our predictor outperforms several strong graph-based baselines in both predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic workflows.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifiability in representation learning is commonly evaluated using standard metrics (e.g., MCC, DCI, R^2) on synthetic benchmarks with known ground-truth factors. These metrics are assumed to reflect recovery up to the equivalence class guaranteed by identifiability theory. We show that this assumption holds only under specific structural conditions: each metric implicitly encodes assumptions about both the data-generating process (DGP) and the encoder. When these assumptions are violated, metrics become misspecified and can produce systematic false positives and false negatives. Such failures occur both within classical identifiability regimes and in post-hoc settings where identifiability is most needed. We introduce a taxonomy separating DGP assumptions from encoder geometry, use it to characterise the validity domains of existing metrics, and release an evaluation suite for reproducible stress testing and comparison.

  _Javier Pulido, Filipe Rodrigues_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate forecasting of transportation dynamics is essential for urban mobility and infrastructure planning. Although recent work has achieved strong performance with deep learning models, these methods typically require dataset-specific training, architecture design and hyper-parameter tuning. This paper evaluates whether general-purpose time-series foundation models can serve as forecasters for transportation tasks by benchmarking the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art model, Chronos-2, across ten real-world datasets covering highway traffic volume and flow, urban traffic speed, bike-sharing demand, and electric vehicle charging station data. Under a consistent evaluation protocol, we find that, even without any task-specific fine-tuning, Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy across most datasets, frequently outperforming classical statistical baselines and specialized deep learning architectures, particularly at longer horizons. Beyond point forecasting, we evaluate its native probabilistic outputs using prediction-interval coverage and sharpness, demonstrating that Chronos-2 also provides useful uncertainty quantification without dataset-specific training. In general, this study supports the adoption of time-series foundation models as a key baseline for transportation forecasting research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating density ratios between pairs of intractable data distributions is a core problem in probabilistic modeling, enabling principled comparisons of sample likelihoods under different data-generating processes across conditions and covariates. While exact-likelihood models such as normalizing flows offer a promising approach to density ratio estimation, naive flow-based evaluations are computationally expensive, as they require simulating costly likelihood integrals for each distribution separately. In this work, we leverage condition-aware flow matching to derive a single dynamical formulation for tracking density ratios along generative trajectories. We demonstrate competitive performance on simulated benchmarks for closed-form ratio estimation, and show that our method supports versatile tasks in single-cell genomics data analysis, where likelihood-based comparisons of cellular states across experimental conditions enable treatment effect estimation and batch correction evaluation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models have gained significant traction in offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to model complex trajectory distributions. However, existing generation-based approaches still struggle with long-horizon tasks characterized by sparse rewards. Some hierarchical generation methods have been developed to mitigate this issue by decomposing the original problem into shorter-horizon subproblems using one policy and generating detailed actions with another. While effective, these methods often overlook the multi-scale temporal structure inherent in trajectories, resulting in suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAGE, a Multi-scale Autoregressive GEneration-based offline RL method. MAGE incorporates a condition-guided multi-scale autoencoder to learn hierarchical trajectory representations, along with a multi-scale transformer that autoregressively generates trajectory representations from coarse to fine temporal scales. MAGE effectively captures temporal dependencies of trajectories at multiple resolutions. Additionally, a condition-guided decoder is employed to exert precise control over short-term behaviors. Extensive experiments on five offline RL benchmarks against fifteen baseline algorithms show that MAGE successfully integrates multi-scale trajectory modeling with conditional guidance, generating coherent and controllable trajectories in long-horizon sparse-reward settings.

  Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a principled approach to financial fraud detection by jointly learning from node features and transaction graph topology. However, their effectiveness on real-world anti-money laundering (AML) benchmarks depends critically on training practices such as specifically weight initialisation and normalisation that remain underexplored. We present a systematic ablation of initialisation and normalisation strategies across three GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE) on the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset. Our experiments reveal that initialisation and normalisation are architecture-dependent: GraphSAGE achieves the strongest performance with Xavier initialisation alone, GAT benefits most from combining GraphNorm with Xavier initialisation, while GCN shows limited sensitivity to these modifications. These findings offer practical, architecture-specific guidance for deploying GNNs in AML pipelines for datasets with severe class imbalance. We release a reproducible experimental framework with temporal data splits, seeded runs, and full ablation results.

  Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are revolutionizing the forecasting landscape from specific dataset modeling to generalizable task evaluation. However, we contend that existing benchmarks exhibit common limitations in four dimensions: constrained data composition dominated by reused legacy sources, compromised data integrity lacking rigorous quality assurance, misaligned task formulations detached from real-world contexts, and rigid analysis perspectives that obscure generalizable insights. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability. Furthermore, we propose a novel pattern-level evaluation perspective that moves beyond traditional dataset-level evaluations based on static meta labels. By leveraging structural time series features to characterize intrinsic temporal properties, this approach offers generalizable insights into model capabilities across diverse patterns. We evaluate 12 representative TSFMs and establish a multi-granular leaderboard to facilitate in-depth analysis and visualized inspection. The leaderboard is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite rapid progress in autoregressive video diffusion, an emerging system algorithm bottleneck limits both deployability and generation capability: KV cache memory. In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.

  Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets.

  While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

  In this work, we present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for the Large Language Model (LLM), addressing its limited generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model compared to RL. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (\model), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. With just a single-line change, the method outperforms standard SFT on multiple difficult benchmarks and base models, from math reasoning to code generation and multi-modal tasks, demonstrating improved generalization. Additionally, \model~achieves competitive results in offline RL settings, providing an effective yet streamlined alternative.

  Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon. Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues, we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network (PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via physics-informed or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems, PITI-DeepONet demonstrates enhanced accuracy and stability over extended inference time horizons when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors reduced by 84\% (versus FR) and 79\% (versus AR) for 1D heat equation; by 87\% (versus FR) and 98\% (versus AR) for the 1D Burgers equation; by 42\% (versus FR) and 89\% (versus AR) for the 2D Allen-Cahn equation; and by 58\% (vs. FR) and 61\% (vs. AR) for the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

  Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years. However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1) disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits -- where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

  Optimization of the last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup of parcels is integral to the logistics optimization pipeline as it entails both cost and resource efficiency and a heightened service quality. Such optimization requires accurate route and time prediction systems to adapt to different scenarios in advance. This work tackles the first building block, namely route prediction. The novel Proximity Attention (PA) mechanism is coupled to a Pointer Network (PN) decoder to leverage the underlying connections between the different visitable pickup positions at each timestep of the parcel pickup process. This local attention is coupled with global context computing via a multi-head attention transformer encoder. Both attentions are then mixed for complete and comprehensive modeling of the problems. PA is also used in the decoding process to skew predictions towards the locations with the highest visit likeliness, thus using inter-connectivity of nodes for next-location prediction. This method is trained, validated and tested on a large industry-level dataset of real-world, last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup named LaDE (2024). This approach outperforms all state-of-the-art supervised methods in terms of most metrics used for benchmarking on this dataset while still being competitive with the best-performing reinforcement learning framework named DRL4Route (2023).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern microscopy routinely produces gigapixel images that contain structures across multiple spatial scales, from fine cellular morphology to broader tissue organization. Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks. These results demonstrate that explicit world-coordinate modelling provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging multi-resolution information in large-scale microscopy analysis.

  The remote sensing community is witnessing a rapid growth of foundation models, which provide powerful embeddings for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, practical adoption and fair comparison remain challenging due to substantial heterogeneity in model release formats, platforms and interfaces, and input data specifications. These inconsistencies significantly increase the cost of obtaining, using, and benchmarking embeddings across models. To address this issue, we propose rs-embed, a Python library that offers a unified, region of interst (ROI) centric interface: with a single line of code, users can retrieve embeddings from any supported model for any location and any time range. The library also provides efficient batch processing to enable large-scale embedding generation and evaluation. The code is available at:this https URL

  One-stream Transformer-based trackers achieve advanced performance in visual object tracking but suffer from significant computational overhead that hinders real-time deployment. While token pruning offers a path to efficiency, existing methods are fragmented. They typically prune the search region, dynamic template, and static template in isolation, overlooking critical inter-component dependencies, which yields suboptimal pruning and degraded accuracy. To address this, we introduce UTPTrack, a simple and Unified Token Pruning framework that, for the first time, jointly compresses all three components. UTPTrack employs an attention-guided, token type-aware strategy to holistically model redundancy, a design that seamlessly supports unified tracking across multimodal and language-guided tasks within a single model. Extensive evaluations on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that UTPTrack achieves a new state-of-the-art in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for pruning-based trackers, pruning 65.4% of vision tokens in RGB-based tracking and 67.5% in unified tracking while preserving 99.7% and 100.5% of baseline performance, respectively. This strong performance across both RGB and multimodal scenarios underlines its potential as a robust foundation for future research in efficient visual tracking.

  Autonomous agents operating in the real world must interact continuously with existing physical and semantic infrastructure, track delayed consequences, and verify outcomes over time. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs)-e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUI-posing core challenges for lifelong embodied agents, including partial observability, causal reasoning across time, and failure-aware verification under real-world constraints. Yet, current benchmarks rarely consider such long-horizon interaction and causality requirements. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control & Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities-task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state transition prediction, and result verification-under ego-centric RGB video input and device diversity across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices/appliances. Results from commercial and open LMMMs reveal systematic failures, highlighting critical gaps for lifelong agent deployment. SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible non-contaminated evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of relevant training data.

  Understanding sources of uncertainty is fundamental to trustworthy three-dimensional scene modeling. While recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve impressive accuracy in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, the lack of uncertainty estimation significantly limits their deployment in safety-critical settings. Existing uncertainty quantification methods for NeRFs fail to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Among those that do quantify one or the other, many of them either compromise rendering quality or incur significant computational overhead to obtain uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we introduce Evidential Neural Radiance Fields, a probabilistic approach that seamlessly integrates with the NeRF rendering process and enables direct quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from a single forward pass. We compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods on three standardized benchmarks, where our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art scene reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty estimation quality.

  Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) links language to region level visual perception. Standard benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg) have progressed rapidly with multimodal LLMs but remain weak tests of visual reasoning and grounding: (i) many expressions are very short, leaving little reasoning demand; (ii) images often contain few distractors, making the target easy to find; and (iii) redundant descriptors enable shortcut solutions that bypass genuine text understanding and visual reasoning. We introduce Ref-Adv, a modern REC benchmark that suppresses shortcuts by pairing linguistically nontrivial expressions with only the information necessary to uniquely identify the target. The dataset contains referring expressions on real images, curated with hard distractors and annotated with reasoning facets including negation. We conduct comprehensive ablations (word order perturbations and descriptor deletion sufficiency) to show that solving Ref-Adv requires reasoning beyond simple cues, and we evaluate a broad suite of contemporary multimodal LLMs on Ref-Adv. Despite strong results on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, models drop markedly on Ref-Adv, revealing reliance on shortcuts and gaps in visual reasoning and grounding. We provide an in depth failure analysis and aim for Ref-Adv to guide future work on visual reasoning and grounding in MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

  Recognizing surgical phases and steps from video is a fundamental problem in computer-assisted interventions. Recent approaches increasingly rely on large-scale pre-training on thousands of labeled surgical videos, followed by zero-shot transfer to specific procedures. While effective, this strategy incurs substantial computational and data collection costs. In this work, we question whether such heavy pre-training is truly necessary. We propose Text-Augmented Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (TASOT), an unsupervised method for surgical phase and step recognition that extends Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (ASOT) by incorporating textual information generated directly from the videos. TASOT formulates temporal action segmentation as a multimodal optimal transport problem, where the matching cost is defined as a weighted combination of visual and text-based costs. The visual term captures frame-level appearance similarity, while the text term provides complementary semantic cues, and both are jointly regularized through a temporally consistent unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulation. This design enables effective alignment between video frames and surgical actions without surgical-specific pretraining or external web-scale supervision. We evaluate TASOT on multiple benchmark surgical datasets and observe consistent and substantial improvements over existing zero-shot methods, including StrasBypass70 (+23.7), BernBypass70 (+4.5), Cholec80 (+16.5), and AutoLaparo (+19.6). These results demonstrate that fine-grained surgical understanding can be achieved by exploiting information already present in standard visual and textual representations, without resorting to increasingly complex pre-training pipelines.

  The advent of large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has produced a vast zoo of medical foundation models. However, selecting optimal medical foundation models for specific segmentation tasks remains a computational bottleneck. Existing Transferability Estimation (TE) metrics, primarily designed for classification, rely on global statistical assumptions and fail to capture the topological complexity essential for dense prediction. We propose a novel Topology-Driven Transferability Estimation framework that evaluates manifold tractability rather than statistical overlap. Our approach introduces three components: (1) Global Representation Topology Divergence (GRTD), utilizing Minimum Spanning Trees to quantify feature-label structural isomorphism; (2) Local Boundary-Aware Topological Consistency (LBTC), which assesses manifold separability specifically at critical anatomical boundaries; and (3) Task-Adaptive Fusion, which dynamically integrates global and local metrics based on the semantic cardinality of the target task. Validated on the large-scale OpenMind benchmark across diverse anatomical targets and SSL foundation models, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by around \textbf{31\%} relative improvement in the weighted Kendall, providing a robust, training-free proxy for efficient model selection without the cost of fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

  Significant progress has been made in the field of Instruction-based Image Editing Models (IIEMs). However, while these models demonstrate plausible adherence to instructions and strong reasoning ability on current benchmarks, their ability to edit small objects remains underexplored, despite its importance for precise local editing and refining details in both real and generated images. In this paper, we introduce DeepLookEditBench (DLEBench), the first benchmark dedicated to assessing the abilities of IIEMs in editing small-scale objects. Specifically, we construct a challenging testbed comprising 1889 samples across seven instruction types. In these samples, target objects occupy only 1%-10% of the image area, covering complex scenarios such as partial occlusion and multi-object editing. To ensure robust evaluation on this benchmark, we propose an evaluation protocol with refined score rubrics to minimize subjectivity and ambiguity in two criteria: Instruction Following and Visual Consistency. This protocol also introduces a dual-mode evaluation framework (Tool-driven and Oracle-guided Modes) addressing the misalignment between LMM-as-a-Judge and human judgements on DLEBench. Empirical results on 10 IIEMs reveal significant performance gaps in small-scale object editing, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks to advance this ability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent multimodal models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have shown remarkable ability to align visual and linguistic representations. However, domains where small visual differences carry large semantic significance, such as diagram understanding, remain challenging due to the models' limited sensitivity to fine-grained structural variations.We propose a new training paradigm designed to enhance diagram comprehension in vision-language models. Our approach introduces pseudo contrastive samples generated by a diagram renderer that creates synthetic diagrams using randomly picked text elements. These samples highlight structural differences in diagrammatic imagery without requiring any modification or editing of the original data. By incorporating these pseudo contrastive samples into the training objective, the model learns to capture more precise and semantically consistent diagram structures.Empirical evaluations on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts demonstrate substantial improvements over standard CLIP and hard-negative CLIP training in both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. The results underscore the value of domain-specific training strategies and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader context of vision-language learning.

  Cartographic reasoning is the skill of interpreting geographic relationships by aligning legends, map scales, compass directions, map texts, and geometries across one or more map images. Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. These results reveal a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning, positioning FRIEDA as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress on spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

  Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation. We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2 exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

  In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing.

  Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

  Humans perceive actions through key transitions that structure actions across multiple abstraction levels, whereas machines, relying on visual features, tend to over-segment. This highlights the difficulty of enabling hierarchical reasoning in video understanding. Interestingly, we observe that lower-level visual and high-level action latent variables evolve at different rates, with low-level visual variables changing rapidly, while high-level action variables evolve more slowly, making them easier to identify. Building on this insight, we propose the Hierarchical Action Learning (\textbf{HAL}) model for weakly-supervised action segmentation. Our approach introduces a hierarchical causal data generation process, where high-level latent action governs the dynamics of low-level visual features. To model these varying timescales effectively, we introduce deterministic processes to align these latent variables over time. The \textbf{HAL} model employs a hierarchical pyramid transformer to capture both visual features and latent variables, and a sparse transition constraint is applied to enforce the slower dynamics of high-level action variables. This mechanism enhances the identification of these latent variables over time. Under mild assumptions, we prove that these latent action variables are strictly identifiable. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that the \textbf{HAL} model significantly outperforms existing methods for weakly-supervised action segmentation, confirming its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

  Recent progress in text-to-image generation has greatly advanced visual fidelity and creativity, but it has also imposed higher demands on prompt complexity-particularly in encoding intricate spatial relationships. In such cases, achieving satisfactory results often requires multiple sampling attempts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method that strengthens the spatial understanding of current image generation models. We first construct the SpatialReward-Dataset with over 80k preference pairs. Building on this dataset, we build SpatialScore, a reward model designed to evaluate the accuracy of spatial relationships in text-to-image generation, achieving performance that even surpasses leading proprietary models on spatial evaluation. We further demonstrate that this reward model effectively enables online reinforcement learning for the complex spatial generation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our specialized reward model yields significant and consistent gains in spatial understanding for image generation.

  In 3D point cloud object tracking, the motion-centric methods have emerged as a promising avenue due to its superior performance in modeling inter-frame motion. However, existing two-stage motion-based approaches suffer from fundamental limitations: (1) error accumulation due to decoupled optimization caused by explicit foreground segmentation prior to motion estimation, and (2) computational bottlenecks from sequential processing. To address these challenges, we propose FocusTrack, a novel one-stage paradigms tracking framework that unifies motion-semantics co-modeling through two core innovations: Inter-frame Motion Modeling (IMM) and Focus-and-Suppress Attention. The IMM module employs a temp-oral-difference siamese encoder to capture global motion patterns between adjacent frames. The Focus-and-Suppress attention that enhance the foreground semantics via motion-salient feature gating and suppress the background noise based on the temporal-aware motion context from IMM without explicit segmentation. Based on above two designs, FocusTrack enables end-to-end training with compact one-stage pipeline. Extensive experiments on prominent 3D tracking benchmarks, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo, demonstrate that the FocusTrack achieves new SOTA performance while running at a high speed with 105 FPS.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning directly from boundary representations (B-reps) has significantly advanced 3D CAD analysis. However, state-of-the-art B-rep learning methods rely on absolute coordinates and normals to encode global context, making them highly sensitive to rotations. Our experiments reveal that models achieving over 95% accuracy on aligned benchmarks can collapse to as low as 10% under arbitrary $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ rotations. To address this, we introduce FoV-Net, the first B-rep learning framework that captures both local surface geometry and global structural context in a rotation-invariant manner. Each face is represented by a Local Reference Frame (LRF) UV-grid that encodes its local surface geometry, and by Field-of-View (FoV) grids that capture the surrounding 3D context by casting rays and recording intersections with neighboring faces. Lightweight CNNs extract per-face features, which are propagated over the B-rep graph using a graph attention network. FoV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on B-rep classification and segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating robustness to arbitrary rotations while also requiring less training data to achieve strong results.

  Recent advancements in neural surface reconstruction have significantly enhanced 3D reconstruction. However, current real world datasets mainly focus on benchmarking multiview stereo (MVS) based on RGB inputs. Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) and multiview shape from polarization (MVSfP), though indispensable on high-fidelity surface reconstruction and sparse inputs, have not been quantitatively assessed together with MVS. To determine the working range of different MVX (MVS, MVSfP, and MVPS) techniques, we propose EvalMVX, a real-world dataset containing $25$ objects, each captured with a polarized camera under $20$ varying views and $17$ light conditions including OLAT and natural illumination, leading to $8,500$ images. Each object includes aligned ground-truth 3D mesh, facilitating quantitative benchmarking of MVX methods simultaneously. Based on our EvalMVX, we evaluate $13$ MVX methods published in recent years, record the best-performing methods, and identify open problems under diverse geometric details and reflectance types. We hope EvalMVX and the benchmarking results can inspire future research on multiview 3D reconstruction.

  _Zhaolin Cai, Fan Li, Huiyu Duan, Lijun He, Guangtao Zhai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal events in videos. Traditional VAD methods generally suffer from the high costs of labeled data and full training, thus some recent works have explored leveraging frozen multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in a tuning-free manner to perform VAD. However, their performance is limited as they directly inherit pre-training biases and cannot adapt internal representations to specific video contexts, leading to difficulties in handling subtle or ambiguous anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel intervention framework, termed SteerVAD, which advances MLLM-based VAD by shifting from passively reading to actively steering and rectifying internal representations. Our approach first leverages the gradient-free representational separability analysis (RSA) to identify top attention heads as latent anomaly experts (LAEs) which are most discriminative for VAD. Then a hierarchical meta-controller (HMC) generates dynamic rectification signals by jointly conditioning on global context and these LAE outputs. The signals execute targeted, anisotropic scaling directly upon the LAE representation manifolds, amplifying anomaly-relevant dimensions while suppressing inherent biases. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free approaches requiring only 1% of training data, establishing it as a powerful new direction for video anomaly detection. The code will be released upon the publication.

  3D super-resolution (3DSR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) 3D scenes from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Existing methods rely on dense LR inputs and per-scene optimization, which restricts the high-frequency priors for constructing HR 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to those inherited from pretrained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models. This severely limits reconstruction fidelity, cross-scene generalization, and real-time usability. We propose to reformulate 3DSR as a direct feed-forward mapping from sparse LR views to HR 3DGS representations, enabling the model to autonomously learn 3D-specific high-frequency geometry and appearance from large-scale, multi-scene data. This fundamentally changes how 3DSR acquires high-frequency knowledge and enables robust generalization to unseen scenes. Specifically, we introduce SR3R, a feed-forward framework that directly predicts HR 3DGS representations from sparse LR views via the learned mapping network. To further enhance reconstruction fidelity, we introduce Gaussian offset learning and feature refinement, which stabilize reconstruction and sharpen high-frequency details. SR3R is plug-and-play and can be paired with any feed-forward 3DGS reconstruction backbone: the backbone provides an LR 3DGS scaffold, and SR3R upscales it to an HR 3DGS.

  The widespread use of smartphones has made photography ubiquitous, yet a clear gap remains between ordinary users and professional photographers, who can identify aesthetic issues and provide actionable shooting guidance during capture. We define this capability as aesthetic guidance (AG) -- an essential but largely underexplored domain in computational aesthetics. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily offer overly positive feedback, failing to identify issues or provide actionable guidance. Without AG capability, they cannot effectively identify distracting regions or optimize compositional balance, thus also struggling in aesthetic cropping, which aims to refine photo composition through reframing after capture. To address this, we introduce AesGuide, the first large-scale AG dataset and benchmark with 10,748 photos annotated with aesthetic scores, analyses, and guidance. Building upon it, we propose Venus, a two-stage framework that first empowers MLLMs with AG capability through progressively complex aesthetic questions and then activates their aesthetic cropping power via CoT-based rationales. Extensive experiments show that Venus substantially improves AG capability and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in aesthetic cropping, enabling interpretable and interactive aesthetic refinement across both stages of photo creation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly rely on visual chain-of-thought to perform region-grounded reasoning over images. However, existing approaches ground regions via either textified coordinates-causing modality mismatch and semantic fragmentation or fixed-granularity patches that both limit precise region selection and often require non-trivial architectural changes. In this paper, we propose Numerical Visual Chain-of-Thought (NV-CoT), a framework that enables MLLMs to reason over images using continuous numerical coordinates. NV-CoT expands the MLLM action space from discrete vocabulary tokens to a continuous Euclidean space, allowing models to directly generate bounding-box coordinates as actions with only minimal architectural modification. The framework supports both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we replace categorical token policies with a Gaussian (or Laplace) policy over coordinates and introduce stochasticity via reparameterized sampling, making NV-CoT fully compatible with GRPO-style policy optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks against eight representative visual reasoning baselines demonstrate that NV-CoT significantly improves localization precision and final answer accuracy, while also accelerating training convergence, validating the effectiveness of continuous-action visual reasoning in MLLMs. The code is available inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) demonstrates significant potential for handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, conflicts arise between static parametric knowledge in vision language models (VLMs) and dynamically retrieved information due to the static model knowledge from pre-training. The outputs either ignore retrieved contexts or exhibit inconsistent integration with parametric knowledge, posing substantial challenges for KB-VQA. Current knowledge conflict mitigation methods primarily adapted from language-based approaches, focusing on context-level conflicts through engineered prompting strategies or context-aware decoding mechanisms. However, these methods neglect the critical role of visual information in conflicts and suffer from redundant retrieved contexts, which impair accurate conflict identification and effective mitigation. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CC-VQA}: a novel training-free, conflict- and correlation-aware method for KB-VQA. Our method comprises two core components: (1) Vision-Centric Contextual Conflict Reasoning, which performs visual-semantic conflict analysis across internal and external knowledge contexts; and (2) Correlation-Guided Encoding and Decoding, featuring positional encoding compression for low-correlation statements and adaptive decoding using correlation-weighted conflict scoring. Extensive evaluations on E-VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CC-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding absolute accuracy improvements of 3.3\% to 6.4\% compared to existing methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When a text description is extended with an additional detail, image-text similarity should drop if that detail is wrong. We show that CLIP-style dual encoders often violate this intuition: appending a plausible but incorrect object or relation to an otherwise correct description can increase the similarity score. We call such cases half-truths. On COCO, CLIP prefers the correct shorter description only 40.6% of the time, and performance drops to 32.9% when the added detail is a relation. We trace this vulnerability to weak supervision on caption parts: contrastive training aligns full sentences but does not explicitly enforce that individual entities and relations are grounded. We propose CS-CLIP (Component-Supervised CLIP), which decomposes captions into entity and relation units, constructs a minimally edited foil for each unit, and fine-tunes the model to score the correct unit above its foil while preserving standard dual-encoder inference. CS-CLIP raises half-truth accuracy to 69.3% and improves average performance on established compositional benchmarks by 5.7 points, suggesting that reducing half-truth errors aligns with broader gains in compositional understanding.

  In this paper, we propose ReSeg-CLIP, a new training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation method for remote sensing data. To compensate for the problems of vision language models, such as CLIP in semantic segmentation caused by inappropriate interactions within the self-attention layers, we introduce a hierarchical scheme utilizing masks generated by SAM to constrain the interactions at multiple scales. We also present a model composition approach that averages the parameters of multiple RS-specific CLIP variants, taking advantage of a new weighting scheme that evaluates representational quality using varying text prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across three RS benchmarks without additional training.

  Complex video reasoning, actually, relies excessively on fine-grained perception rather than on expert (e.g., Ph.D, Science)-level reasoning. Through extensive empirical observation, we have recognized the critical impact of perception. In particular, when perception ability is almost fixed, enhancing reasoning from Qwen3-8B to OpenAI-o3 yields only 0.7% performance improvement. Conversely, even minimal change in perception model scale (from 7B to 32B) boosts performance by 1.4%, indicating enhancing perception, rather than reasoning, is more critical to improve performance. Therefore, exploring how to enhance perception ability through reasoning without the need for expensive fine-grained annotation information is worthwhile. To achieve this goal, we specially propose APPO, the Attention-guided Perception Policy Optimization algorithm that leverages token-level dense rewards to improve model's fine-grained perception. The core idea behind APPO is to optimize those tokens from different responses that primarily focus on the same crucial video frame (called intra-group perception tokens). Experimental results on diverse video benchmarks and models with different scales (3/7B) demonstrate APPO consistently outperforms GRPO and DAPO (0.5%~4%). We hope our work provides a promising approach to effectively enhance model's perception abilities through reasoning in a low-cost manner, serving diverse scenarios and demands.

  Rapid progress in vision-language modeling has enabled pathology report generation from gigapixel whole-slide images, but most approaches assume static training with simultaneous access to all data. In clinical deployment, however, new organs, institutions, and reporting conventions emerge over time, and sequential fine-tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We introduce an exemplar-free continual learning framework for WSI-to-report generation that avoids storing raw slides or patch exemplars. The core idea is a compact domain footprint built in a frozen patch-embedding space: a small codebook of representative morphology tokens together with slide-level co-occurrence summaries and lightweight patch-count priors. These footprints support generative replay by synthesizing pseudo-WSI representations that reflect domain-specific morphological mixtures, while a teacher snapshot provides pseudo-reports to supervise the updated model without retaining past data. To address shifting reporting conventions, we distill domain-specific linguistic characteristics into a compact style descriptor and use it to steer generation. At inference, the model identifies the most compatible descriptor directly from the slide signal, enabling domain-agnostic setup without requiring explicit domain identifiers. Evaluated across multiple public continual learning benchmarks, our approach outperforms exemplar-free and limited-buffer rehearsal baselines, highlighting footprint-based generative replay as a practical solution for deployment in evolving clinical settings.

  _Chongyang Xu, Haipeng Li, Shen Cheng, Jingyu Hu, Haoqiang Fan, Ziliang Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bimanual manipulation requires policies that can reason about 3D geometry, anticipate how it evolves under action, and generate smooth, coordinated motions. However, existing methods typically rely on 2D features with limited spatial awareness, or require explicit point clouds that are difficult to obtain reliably in real-world settings. At the same time, recent 3D geometric foundation models show that accurate and diverse 3D structure can be reconstructed directly from RGB images in a fast and robust manner. We leverage this opportunity and propose a framework that builds bimanual manipulation directly on a pre-trained 3D geometric foundation model. Our policy fuses geometry-aware latents, 2D semantic features, and proprioception into a unified state representation, and uses diffusion model to jointly predict a future action chunk and a future 3D latent that decodes into a dense pointmap. By explicitly predicting how the 3D scene will evolve together with the action sequence, the policy gains strong spatial understanding and predictive capability using only RGB observations. We evaluate our method both in simulation on the RoboTwin benchmark and in real-world robot executions. Our approach consistently outperforms 2D-based and point-cloud-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in manipulation success, inter-arm coordination, and 3D spatial prediction accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately segmenting objects without any manual annotations remains one of the core challenges in computer vision. In this work, we introduce Selfment, a fully self-supervised framework that segments foreground objects directly from raw images without human labels, pretrained segmentation models, or any post-processing. Selfment first constructs patch-level affinity graphs from self-supervised features and applies NCut to obtain an initial coarse foreground--background separation. We then introduce Iterative Patch Optimization (IPO), a feature-space refinement procedure that progressively enforces spatial coherence and semantic consistency through iterative patch clustering. The refined masks are subsequently used as supervisory signals to train a lightweight segmentation head with contrastive and region-consistency objectives, allowing the model to learn stable and transferable object representations. Despite its simplicity and complete absence of manual supervision, Selfment sets new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. It achieves substantial improvements on $F_{\max}$ over previous unsupervised saliency detection methods on ECSSD ($+4.0\%$), HKUIS ($+4.6\%$), and PASCAL-S ($+5.7\%$). Moreover, without any additional fine-tuning, Selfment demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to camouflaged object detection tasks (e.g., $0.910$ $S_m$ on CHAMELEON and $0.792$ $F_{\beta}^{\omega}$ on CAMO), outperforming all existing unsupervised approaches and even rivaling the SoTA fully supervised methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (U-MLLMs) integrate understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, existing evaluations typically assess these capabilities separately, overlooking semantic equivalence, i.e., the ability to manifest consistent reasoning results regardless of the output modality. In this work, we investigate whether current U-MLLMs satisfy this premise. We observe that while models demonstrate robust textual reasoning, they fail to maintain semantic equivalence when required to render the same results in the image modality. To rigorously diagnose this discrepancy, we introduce VGUBench, a framework to decouple reasoning logic from generation fidelity. VGUBench comprises three diagnostic tasks: (1)Textual Generative Understanding, establishing a baseline for reasoning accuracy in textual response; (2)Visual Generative Understanding, evaluating the ability to generate visual responses that represent the correct answer; and (3)a Visual Rendering control task, which assesses the ability to directly render explicit visual descriptions into images without complex reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a significant disparity: despite strong performance in textual understanding and visual rendering, U-MLLMs exhibit a marked performance collapse when required to generate visual answers to questions. Furthermore, we find a negligible correlation between visual answering performance and basic rendering quality. These results suggest that the failure stems not from insufficient generation fidelity, but from a breakdown in cross-modal semantic alignment. We provide diagnostic insights to address this challenge in future Unified Generation and Understanding Models.

  Ultra-long egocentric videos spanning multiple days present significant challenges for video understanding. Existing approaches still rely on fragmented local processing and limited temporal modeling, restricting their ability to reason over such extended sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoGraph, a training-free and dynamic knowledge-graph construction framework that explicitly encodes long-term, cross-entity dependencies in egocentric video streams. EgoGraph employs a novel egocentric schema that unifies the extraction and abstraction of core entities, such as people, objects, locations, and events, and structurally reasons about their attributes and interactions, yielding a significantly richer and more coherent semantic representation than traditional clip-based video models. Crucially, we develop a temporal relational modeling strategy that captures temporal dependencies across entities and accumulates stable long-term memory over multiple days, enabling complex temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on the EgoLifeQA and EgoR1-bench benchmarks demonstrate that EgoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term video question answering, validating its effectiveness as a new paradigm for ultra-long egocentric video understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object swapping aims to replace a source object in a scene with a reference object while preserving object fidelity, scene fidelity, and object-scene harmony. Existing methods either require per-object finetuning and slow inference or rely on extra paired data that mostly depict the same object across contexts, forcing models to rely on background cues rather than learning cross-object alignment. We propose SourceSwap, a self-supervised and source-aware framework that learns cross-object alignment. Our key insight is to synthesize high-quality pseudo pairs from any image via a frequency-separated perturbation in the initial-noise space, which alters appearance while preserving pose, coarse shape, and scene layout, requiring no videos, multi-view data, or additional images. We then train a dual U-Net with full-source conditioning and a noise-free reference encoder, enabling direct inter-object alignment, zero-shot inference without per-object finetuning, and lightweight iterative refinement. We further introduce SourceBench, a high-quality benchmark with higher resolution, more categories, and richer interactions. Experiments demonstrate that SourceSwap achieves superior fidelity, stronger scene preservation, and more natural harmony, and it transfers well to edits such as subject-driven refinement and face swapping.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained crop-weed segmentation is essential for enabling targeted herbicide application in precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous agricultural environments due to reliance on dataset-specific visual features. We propose Vision-Language Weed Segmentation (VL-WS), a novel framework that addresses this limitation by grounding pixel-level segmentation in semantically aligned, domain-invariant representations. Our architecture employs a dual-encoder design, where frozen Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings and task-specific spatial features are fused and modulated via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers conditioned on natural language captions. This design enables image level textual descriptions to guide channel-wise feature refinement while preserving fine-grained spatial localization. Unlike prior works restricted to training and evaluation on single-source datasets, VL-WS is trained on a unified corpus that includes close-range ground imagery (robotic platforms) and high-altitude UAV imagery, covering diverse crop types, weed species, growth stages, and sensing conditions. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, with VL-WS achieving a mean Dice score of 91.64% and outperforming the CNN baseline by 4.98%. The largest gains occur on the most challenging weed class, where VL-WS attains 80.45% Dice score compared to 65.03% for the best baseline, representing a 15.42% improvement. VL-WS further maintains stable weed segmentation performance under limited target-domain supervision, indicating improved generalization and data efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of vision-language alignment to enable scalable, label-efficient segmentation models deployable across diverse real-world agricultural domains.

  We introduce BuildAnyPoint, a novel generative framework for structured 3D building reconstruction from point clouds with diverse distributions, such as those captured by airborne LiDAR and Structure-from-Motion. To recover artist-created building abstraction in this highly underconstrained setting, we capitalize on the role of explicit 3D generative priors in autoregressive mesh generation. Specifically, we design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes. We first formulate distribution recovery as a conditional generation task by training latent diffusion models conditioned on input point clouds, and then tailor a decoder-only transformer for conditional autoregressive mesh generation based on the recovered point clouds. Our method delivers substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements over prior building abstraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by the strong performance of its recovered point clouds on building point cloud completion benchmarks, which exhibit improved surface accuracy and distribution uniformity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with high-resolution visual inputs during the reasoning process, as the number of image tokens increases quadratically with resolution, introducing substantial redundancy and irrelevant information. A common practice is to identify key image regions and refer to their high-resolution counterparts during reasoning, typically trained with external visual supervision. However, such visual supervision cues require costly grounding labels from human annotators. Meanwhile, it remains an open question how to enhance a model's grounding abilities to support reasoning without relying on additional annotations. In this paper, we propose High-resolution Annotation-free Reasoning Technique (HART), a closed-loop framework that enables LMMs to focus on and self-verify key regions of high-resolution visual inputs. HART incorporates a post-training paradigm in which we design Advantage Preference Group Relative Policy Optimization (AP-GRPO) to encourage accurate localization of key regions. Notably, HART provides explainable reasoning pathways and enables efficient optimization of localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HART improves performance across a wide range of high-resolution visual tasks, consistently outperforming strong baselines. When applied to post-train Qwen2.5-VL-7B, HART even surpasses larger-scale models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and LLaVA-OneVision-72B on high-resolution, vision-centric benchmarks.

  Neuro-symbolic approaches to long-form video question answering (LVQA) have demonstrated significant accuracy improvements by grounding temporal reasoning in formal verification. However, existing methods incur prohibitive latency overheads, up to 90x slower than base VLM prompting, rendering them impractical for latency-sensitive edge deployments. We present LE-NeuS, a latency-efficient neuro-symbolic framework that preserves the accuracy benefits of temporal logic-guided video understanding while drastically reducing inference latency. Our key insight is that the dominant computational bottleneck arises from sequential and dense proposition detection across video frames during automaton construction. We address this through two principled optimizations: (1) CLIP guided two-stage adaptive sampling that exploits visual redundancy to skip semantically similar frames while preserving temporal boundaries, and (2) batched proposition detection that parallelizes VLM inference across temporal windows. Theoretically, we derive latency bounds as a function of video length, proposition complexity, and sampling density, establishing conditions under which latency efficiency is achievable. Empirically, on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks deployed on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, LE-NeuS reduces the latency gap from 90x to approximately 10x while maintaining >10% accuracy gains on temporally complex queries.

  _Xudong Yan, Songhe Feng, Jiaxin Wang, Xin Su, Yi Jin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

  We present FlowFixer, a refinement framework for subject-driven generation (SDG) that restores fine details lost during generation caused by changes in scale and perspective of a subject. FlowFixer proposes direct image-to-image translation from visual references, avoiding ambiguities in language prompts. To enable image-to-image training, we introduce a one-step denoising scheme to generate self-supervised training data, which automatically removes high-frequency details while preserving global structure, effectively simulating real-world SDG errors. We further propose a keypoint matching-based metric to properly assess fidelity in details beyond semantic similarities usually measured by CLIP or DINO. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowFixer outperforms state-of-the-art SDG methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, setting a new benchmark for high-fidelity subject-driven generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current methods for multivariate time series forecasting can be classified into channel-dependent and channel-independent models. Channel-dependent models learn cross-channel features but often overfit the channel ordering, which hampers adaptation when channels are added or reordered. Channel-independent models treat each channel in isolation to increase flexibility, yet this neglects inter-channel dependencies and limits performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CPiRi}, a \textbf{channel permutation invariant (CPI)} framework that infers cross-channel structure from data rather than memorizing a fixed ordering, enabling deployment in settings with structural and distributional co-drift without retraining. CPiRi couples \textbf{spatio-temporal decoupling architecture} with \textbf{permutation-invariant regularization training strategy}: a frozen pretrained temporal encoder extracts high-quality temporal features, a lightweight spatial module learns content-driven inter-channel relations, while a channel shuffling strategy enforces CPI during training. We further \textbf{ground CPiRi in theory} by analyzing permutation equivariance in multivariate time series forecasting. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show state-of-the-art results. CPiRi remains stable when channel orders are shuffled and exhibits strong \textbf{inductive generalization} to unseen channels even when trained on \textbf{only half} of the channels, while maintaining \textbf{practical efficiency} on large-scale datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long video understanding is essential for human-like intelligence, enabling coherent perception and reasoning over extended temporal contexts. While the emerging thinking-with-frames paradigm, which alternates between global temporal reasoning and local frame examination, has advanced the reasoning capabilities of video multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), it suffers from a significant efficiency bottleneck due to the progressively growing and redundant multi-modal context. To address this, we propose SpecTemp, a reinforcement learning-based Speculative Temporal reasoning framework that decouples temporal perception from reasoning via a cooperative dual-model design. In SpecTemp, a lightweight draft MLLM rapidly explores and proposes salient frames from densely sampled temporal regions, while a powerful target MLLM focuses on temporal reasoning and verifies the draft's proposals, iteratively refining its attention until convergence. This design mirrors the collaborative pathways of the human brain, balancing efficiency with accuracy. To support training, we construct the SpecTemp-80K dataset, featuring synchronized dual-level annotations for coarse evidence spans and fine-grained frame-level evidence. Experiments across multiple video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SpecTemp not only maintains competitive accuracy but also significantly accelerates inference compared with existing thinking-with-frames methods.

  Evaluating AI-generated video (AIGV) quality hinges on three crucial dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. While numerous evaluation datasets and algorithms have been proposed, existing approaches are constrained by two limitations: the absence of systematic definitions for evaluation dimensions, and the isolated treatment of the three dimensions in separate models. Therefore, we introduce Q-Save, a holistic benchmark dataset and unified evaluation model for AIGV quality assessment. The Q-Save dataset contains nearly 10,000 video samples, each annotated with Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) and fine-grained attribution explanations across the three core dimensions. Leveraging this attribution-annotated dataset, we train the proposed Q-Save model, which adopts the SlowFast framework to balance accuracy and efficiency, and employs a three-stage training strategy with Chain-of-Thought (COT) formatted data: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and a final SFT round for stability, to jointly perform quality scoring and attribution generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-Save achieves superior performance in AIGV quality prediction while providing interpretable justifications. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.

  Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations. Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space, but risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose ZOO-Prune, a training-free framework built on the intuition that highly sensitive tokens have a stronger influence on the model's output and capture complementary visual cues rather than redundant ones. To achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the lightweight projection layer. This measures how small random perturbations affect the projected features and enables efficient approximation of each token's influence without backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that ZOO-Prune consistently outperforms prior methods while pruning up to 94.4% of tokens without sacrificing accuracy. Our method also improves efficiency, reaching up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference compared to the baseline.

  Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images but are vulnerable to malicious backdoor attacks that inject harmful biases (e.g., trigger-activated gender or racial stereotypes). Existing debiasing methods, often designed for natural statistical biases, struggle with these deliberately and subtly injected attacks. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and mitigates these malicious biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of the specific attack types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect trigger-activated visual patterns and constructs neutralization guides by generating counter-prompts. These guides drive a CLIP-guided training process that breaks the harmful associations while preserving the original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike methods designed for natural bias, AutoDebias effectively addresses subtle, injected stereotypes and multiple interacting attacks. We evaluate the framework on a new benchmark covering 17 distinct backdoor scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple backdoors co-exist. AutoDebias detects malicious patterns with 91.6% accuracy and reduces the backdoor success rate from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the visual fidelity of the original model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns - an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1) higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual fall detection models trained on small, staged datasets have unclear real-world utility due to limited diversity and inconsistent evaluation protocols. We present OmniFall, a unified benchmark with 80 hours / 15k videos and dense frame-level annotations in a harmonized 16-class taxonomy, spanning three complementary domains: OF-Staged (eight public staged sets, standardized with cross-subject/view splits), OF-Synthetic (12k videos, 17 h; controlled diversity in age, body type, environment, camera), and OF-In-the-Wild (the first test-only benchmark curated from genuine accident videos). OmniFall supports both video classification and timeline segmentation, and its cross-domain protocol isolates staged/synthetic-to-wild generalization. Our results show that carefully designed synthetic data can match or surpass real staged footage on cross-domain transfer, while reducing privacy risk and easing data collection. By combining privacy-amenable synthetic/staged sources with a public, test-only wild target and releasing dense, standardized timelines, OmniFall provides a comprehensive benchmark for privacy-preserving fall detection and fall-related (pre/post-fall) segmentation, enabling robust detectors that generalize to uncontrolled environments.

  Synthetic datasets are a crucial ingredient for training stereo matching networks, but the question of what makes a stereo dataset effective remains underexplored. We investigate the design space of synthetic datasets by varying the parameters of a procedural dataset generator, and report the effects on zero-shot stereo matching performance using standard benchmarks. We validate our findings by collecting the best settings and creating a large-scale dataset. Training only on this dataset achieves better performance than training on a mixture of widely used datasets, and is competitive with training on the FoundationStereo dataset, with the additional benefit of open-source generation code and an accompanying parameter analysis to enable further research. We open-source our system atthis https URLto enable further research on procedural stereo datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ARPG, a novel visual Autoregressive model that enables Randomized Parallel Generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot tasks such as image in-painting, out-painting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.

  The rapid advancement of video generation models has made it increasingly challenging to distinguish AI-generated videos from real ones. This issue underscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to prevent the dissemination of false information via such videos. However, the development of high-performance AI-generated video detectors is currently impeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed for generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a challenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages: 1) Large-scale video collection: The dataset contains 6.78 million videos and is currently the largest dataset for AI-generated video detection. 2) Cross-Source and Cross-Generator: The cross-source generation reduces the interference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures diversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing them from being overly similar. 3) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The dataset includes videos from 11 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring that it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. These generators ensure that the datasets are not only large in scale but also diverse, aiding in the development of generalized and effective detection models. Additionally, we present extensive experimental results with advanced video classification models. With GenVidBench, researchers can efficiently develop and evaluate AI-generated video detection models.. Datasets and code are available atthis https URL.

  Transformer-based models such as BERT have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) across many languages. However, Nepali, a low-resource language written in Devanagari script, remains relatively underexplored. This study benchmarks multilingual, Indic, Hindi, and Nepali BERT variants to evaluate their effectiveness in Nepali topic classification. Ten pre-trained models, including mBERT, XLM-R, MuRIL, DevBERT, HindiBERT, IndicBERT, and NepBERTa, were fine-tuned and tested on the balanced Nepali dataset containing 25,006 sentences across five conceptual domains and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, weighted precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC metrics. The results reveal that Indic models, particularly MuRIL-large, achieved the highest F1-score of 90.60%, outperforming multilingual and monolingual models. NepBERTa also performed competitively with an F1-score of 88.26%. Overall, these findings establish a robust baseline for future document-level classification and broader Nepali NLP applications.

  _Seungdong Yoa, Sanghyu Yoon, Suhee Yoon, Dongmin Kim, Ye Seul Sim, Junhyun Lee, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on static datasets, which offer limited scalability and fail to capture the evolving reasoning capabilities of recent models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an agent-centric benchmarking paradigm that moves beyond static datasets by introducing a dynamic protocol in which autonomous agents iteratively generate, validate, and solve problems. Within this protocol, a teacher agent generates candidate problems, an orchestrator agent rigorously verifies their validity and guards against adversarial attacks, and a student agent attempts to solve the validated problems. An invalid problem is revised by the teacher agent until it passes validation. If the student correctly solves the problem, the orchestrator prompts the teacher to generate more challenging variants. Consequently, the benchmark scales in difficulty automatically as more capable agents are substituted into any role, enabling progressive evaluation of large language models without manually curated datasets. Adopting text anomaly detection as our primary evaluation format, which demands cross-sentence logical inference and resists pattern-matching shortcuts, we demonstrate that this protocol systematically exposes corner-case reasoning errors that conventional benchmarks fail to reveal. We further advocate evaluating systems along several complementary axes including cross-model pairwise performance and progress between the initial and orchestrator-finalized problems. By shifting the focus from fixed datasets to dynamic protocols, our approach offers a sustainable direction for evaluating ever-evolving language models and introduces a research agenda centered on the co-evolution of agent-centric benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

  AI agents powered by reasoning models require access to sensitive user data. However, their reasoning traces are difficult to control, which can result in the unintended leakage of private information to external parties. We propose training models to follow instructions not only in the final answer, but also in reasoning traces, potentially under different constraints. We hypothesize that improving their instruction following abilities in the reasoning traces can improve their privacy-preservation skills. To demonstrate this, we fine-tune models on a new instruction-following dataset with explicit restrictions on reasoning traces. We further introduce a generation strategy that decouples reasoning and answer generation using separate LoRA adapters. We evaluate our approach on six models from two model families, ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters, across two instruction-following benchmarks and two privacy benchmarks. Our method yields substantial improvements, achieving gains of up to 20.9 points in instruction-following performance and up to 51.9 percentage points on privacy benchmarks. These improvements, however, can come at the cost of task utility, due to the trade-off between reasoning performance and instruction-following abilities. Overall, our results show that improving instruction-following behavior in reasoning models can significantly enhance privacy, suggesting a promising direction for the development of future privacy-aware agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), defined as their ability to analyze, infer, and make decisions based on input information, is essential for building intelligent task-oriented dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks do not sufficiently reflect the complexity of real-world scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in evaluating and enhancing LLM reasoning in practical contexts. Many current reasoning datasets are overly simplistic and abstract, often disconnected from realistic task flows, domain constraints, and operational rules, making it difficult to effectively evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning ability. In addition, data contamination from pretraining corpora undermines the reliability of evaluation results, and traditional crowdsourcing methods for dataset construction are labor-intensive and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM-driven framework for synthesizing multi-turn, task-oriented dialogues grounded in realistic reasoning scenarios, leveraging trilevel optimization to enhance dialogue quality. Our method generates dialogues grounded in authentic task scenarios, enriched with real-world information, and exhibiting strong contextual coherence. Corresponding reasoning tasks are carefully designed around these dialogues and iteratively refined to continuously improve the tasks' quality and challenge. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for assessing and advancing the realistic logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results show that our synthetic data-based reasoning tasks introduce non-trivial reasoning challenges and provide meaningful support for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

  _Pengxiang Li, Dilxat Muhtar, Tianlong Chen, Lu Yin, Shiwei Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Despite the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), their strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently, continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three LLMs to the Québec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language benchmarks with around 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic communities. To support reproducibility and broaden access, we release the first Québec French LLMs on Hugging Face.

  The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1) reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure, enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of 15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B. Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research in this direction, we have made the models (this https URL) and code (this https URL) publicly available, along with the complete training recipe, data sources, and data mixing ratios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.We introduce \textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture.Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.

  Memory systems address the challenge of context loss in Large Language Model during prolonged interactions. However, compared to human cognition, the efficacy of these systems in processing emotion-related information remains inconclusive. To address this gap, we propose an emotion-enhanced memory evaluation benchmark to assess the performance of mainstream and state-of-the-art memory systems in handling affective information. We developed the \textbf{H}uman-\textbf{L}ike \textbf{M}emory \textbf{E}motion (\textbf{HLME}) dataset, which evaluates memory systems across three dimensions: emotional information extraction, emotional memory updating, and emotional memory question answering. Experimental results indicate that none of the evaluated systems achieve robust performance across all three tasks. Our findings provide an objective perspective on the current deficiencies of memory systems in processing emotional memories and suggest a new trajectory for future research and system optimization.

  Understanding and extracting structured insights from unstructured documents remains a foundational challenge in industrial NLP. While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot extraction, traditional pipelines often fail to handle multi-document packets, complex reasoning, and strict compliance requirements. We present IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) Accelerator, a framework enabling agentic AI for end-to-end document intelligence with four key components: (1) DocSplit, a novel benchmark dataset and multimodal classifier using BIO tagging to segment complex document packets; (2) configurable Extraction Module leveraging multimodal LLMs to transform unstructured content into structured data; (3) Agentic Analytics Module, compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) providing data access through secure, sandboxed code execution; and (4) Rule Validation Module replacing deterministic engines with LLM-driven logic for complex compliance checks. The interactive demonstration enables users to upload document packets, visualize classification results, and explore extracted data through an intuitive web interface. We demonstrate effectiveness across industries, highlighting a production deployment at a leading healthcare provider achieving 98% classification accuracy, 80% reduced processing latency, and 77% lower operational costs over legacy baselines.

  Though patients are increasingly granted digital access to their electronic health records (EHRs), existing interfaces may not support precise, trustworthy answers to patient-specific questions. Large language models (LLM) show promise in clinical question answering (QA), but retrieval-based approaches are computationally inefficient, prone to hallucination, and difficult to deploy over real-life EHRs. In this work, we introduce FHIRPath-QA, the first open dataset and benchmark for patient-specific QA that includes open-standard FHIRPath queries over real-world clinical data. We propose a text-to-FHIRPath QA paradigm that shifts reasoning from free-text generation to FHIRPath query synthesis, significantly reducing LLM usage. Built on MIMIC-IV on FHIR Demo, the dataset pairs over 14k natural language questions in patient and clinician phrasing with validated FHIRPath queries and answers. Further, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to deal with ambiguity in patient language and perform poorly in FHIRPath query synthesis. However, they benefit strongly from supervised fine-tuning. Our results highlight that text-to-FHIRPath synthesis has the potential to serve as a practical foundation for safe, efficient, and interoperable consumer health applications, and our dataset and benchmark serve as a starting point for future research on the topic.

  Recent deep research agents primarily improve performance by scaling reasoning depth, but this leads to high inference cost and latency in search-intensive scenarios. Moreover, generalization across heterogeneous research settings remains challenging. In this work, we propose \emph{Search More, Think Less} (SMTL), a framework for long-horizon agentic search that targets both efficiency and generalization. SMTL replaces sequential reasoning with parallel evidence acquisition, enabling efficient context management under constrained context budgets. To support generalization across task types, we further introduce a unified data synthesis pipeline that constructs search tasks spanning both deterministic question answering and open-ended research scenarios with task appropriate evaluation metrics. We train an end-to-end agent using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving strong and often state of the art performance across benchmarks including BrowseComp (48.6\%), GAIA (75.7\%), Xbench (82.0\%), and DeepResearch Bench (45.9\%). Compared to Mirothinker-v1.0, SMTL with maximum 100 interaction steps reduces the average number of reasoning steps on BrowseComp by 70.7\%, while improving accuracy.

  Recent work has identified a subset of attention heads in Transformer as retrieval heads, which are responsible for retrieving information from the context. In this work, we first investigate retrieval heads in multilingual contexts. In multilingual language models, we find that retrieval heads are often shared across multiple languages. Expanding the study to cross-lingual setting, we identify Retrieval-Transition heads(RTH), which govern the transition to specific target-language output. Our experiments reveal that RTHs are distinct from retrieval heads and more vital for Chain-of-Thought reasoning in multilingual LLMs. Across four multilingual benchmarks (MMLU-ProX, MGSM, MLQA, and XQuaD) and two model families (Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3.1), we demonstrate that masking RTH induces bigger performance drop than masking Retrieval Heads (RH). Our work advances understanding of multilingual LMs by isolating the attention heads responsible for mapping to target languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) has become a widely used benchmark for evaluating frontier large language models on challenging, multi-domain questions. However, community-led analyses have raised concerns that HLE contains a non-trivial number of noisy items, which can bias evaluation results and distort cross-model comparisons. To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 668 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,143 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified. The improvement is particularly pronounced on items where the original problem statement and/or reference answer is erroneous, with gains of 30--40 percentage points. Our analyses further reveal a strong association between model confidence and the presence of errors in the problem statement or reference answer, supporting the effectiveness of our revisions. Overall, HLE-Verified improves HLE-style evaluations by reducing annotation noise and enabling more faithful measurement of model capabilities. Data is available at:this https URL

  Multiple-choice Reading Comprehension (MCRC) models aim to select the correct answer from a set of candidate options for a given question. However, they typically lack the ability to explain the reasoning behind their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Vietnamese dataset designed to train and evaluate MCRC models with explanation generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset. Additionally, we show that jointly training option decision and explanation generation leads to significant improvements in multiple-choice accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment in long-context scenarios is hindered by two challenges: computational inefficiency and redundant information. We propose RAM (Read As HuMan), a context compression framework that adopts an adaptive hybrid reading strategy, to address these challenges. Inspired by human reading behavior (i.e., close reading important content while skimming less relevant content), RAM partitions the context into segments and encodes them with the input query in parallel. High-relevance segments are fully retained (close reading), while low-relevance ones are query-guided compressed into compact summary vectors (skimming). Both explicit textual segments and implicit summary vectors are concatenated and fed into decoder to achieve both superior performance and natural language format interpretability. To refine the decision boundary between close reading and skimming, we further introduce a contrastive learning objective based on positive and negative query-segment pairs. Experiments demonstrate that RAM outperforms existing baselines on multiple question answering and summarization benchmarks across two backbones, while delivering up to a 12x end-to-end speedup on long inputs (average length 16K; maximum length 32K).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats. These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated, LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for 14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded, uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

  Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy, low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking} phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce \textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods, our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%, establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

  _Shuichiro Haruta, Kazunori Matsumoto, Zhi Li, Yanan Wang, Mori Kurokawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs. Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to Llama-7B and Llama-2-13B, and evaluate it on WikiText2 and multiple language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

  _Manuel Frank, Haithem Afli_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current sentence embedding evaluations typically rely on static test beds like the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While invaluable, repeated tuning on a fixed suite can inflate reported scores and obscure real-world robustness. We introduce the Paraphrasing Text Embedding Benchmark (PTEB), a dynamic protocol that stochastically generates meaning-preserving paraphrases at evaluation time and aggregates results across multiple runs. Using a cost-efficient LLM-based method grounded in gold ratings and human validation, we show that LLMs generate token-diverse but semantically preserving paraphrases. Across 7 MTEB tasks, we validate our hypothesis that the performance of sentence encoders is sensitive to changes in token space even when semantics remain fixed. We also observe that smaller models are not disproportionately affected relative to larger ones. Our results are statistically robust over multiple runs spanning 20 datasets and 25 languages. More generally, we aim to propose a new evaluation paradigm in NLP that relies less on static, pre-defined benchmarks but shifts towards dynamic, stochastic evaluation leveraging eval-time compute. We make the code to run PTEB publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated interpretability aims to translate large language model (LLM) features into human understandable descriptions. However, natural language feature descriptions can be vague, inconsistent, and require manual relabeling. In response, we introduce semantic regexes, structured language descriptions of LLM features. By combining primitives that capture linguistic and semantic patterns with modifiers for contextualization, composition, and quantification, semantic regexes produce precise and expressive feature descriptions. Across quantitative benchmarks and qualitative analyses, semantic regexes match the accuracy of natural language while yielding more concise and consistent feature descriptions. Their inherent structure affords new types of analyses, including quantifying feature complexity across layers, scaling automated interpretability from insights into individual features to model-wide patterns. Finally, in user studies, we find that semantic regexes help people build accurate mental models of LLM features.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern approaches to enhancing Large Language Models' factual accuracy and knowledge utilization face a fundamental trade-off: non-parametric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides flexible access to external knowledge but suffers from high inference latency and shallow integration, while parametric fine-tuning methods like LoRA risk catastrophic forgetting and degraded general capabilities. In this work, we propose MLP Memory, a lightweight parametric module that learns to internalize retrieval patterns without explicit document access. By pretraining an MLP to imitate a $k$NN retriever's behavior on the entire pretraining dataset, we create a differentiable memory component that captures the benefits of retrieval-based knowledge access in a fully parametric form. Our architecture integrates this pretrained MLP Memory with Transformer decoders through simple probability interpolation, yielding 17.5\% and 24.1\% scaling gains on WikiText-103 and Web datasets, respectively. It further achieves 12.3\% relative improvement on five question-answering benchmarks and 5.2 points absolute gain across nine general NLP tasks, while reducing hallucinations by up to 10 points on HaluEval. Moreover, MLP Memory delivers 2.5$\times$ faster inference than RAG with superior accuracy. Our findings show that learning retrieval patterns parametrically bridges the gap between efficient inference and effective knowledge access, offering a practical alternative to both RAG and fine-tuning approaches.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve near-human performance on standard benchmarks, their capabilities often fail to generalize to complex, real-world problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepQuestion, a scalable, automated framework that systematically elevates the cognitive complexity of existing datasets. Grounded in Bloom's taxonomy, DeepQuestion generates (1) scenario-based problems to test the application of knowledge in noisy, realistic contexts, and (2) instruction-based prompts that require models to create new questions from a given solution path, assessing synthesis and evaluation skills. Our extensive evaluation across ten leading open-source and proprietary models reveals a stark performance decline with accuracy dropping by up to 70% as tasks ascend the cognitive hierarchy. These findings underscore that current benchmarks overestimate true reasoning abilities and highlight the critical need for cognitively diverse evaluations to guide future LLM development.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness, overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views. Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data atthis https URL.

  Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into operational code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, particularly from the authors of those papers, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that enables the extraction of meaningful insights from textual data, particularly from dynamic platforms like Twitter and IMDB. This study explores a hybrid framework combining transformer-based models, specifically BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT, to improve sentiment classification accuracy and robustness. The framework addresses challenges such as noisy data, contextual ambiguity, and generalization across diverse datasets by leveraging the unique strengths of these models. BERT captures bidirectional context, GPT-2 enhances generative capabilities, RoBERTa optimizes contextual understanding with larger corpora and dynamic masking, XLNet models dependency through permutation-based learning, and DistilBERT offers efficiency with reduced computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. We demonstrate text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Words (BoW), ensure high-quality input data for the models. The hybrid approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets Sentiment140 and IMDB, achieving superior accuracy rates of 94\% and 95\%, respectively, outperforming standalone models. The results validate the effectiveness of combining multiple transformer models in ensemble-like setups to address the limitations of individual architectures. This research highlights its applicability to real-world tasks such as social media monitoring, customer sentiment analysis, and public opinion tracking which offers a pathway for future advancements in hybrid NLP frameworks.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual reasoning and understanding tasks but still struggle to capture the complexity and subjectivity of human emotions. Existing approaches based on supervised fine-tuning often suffer from limited generalization and poor interpretability, while reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization fail to align with the intrinsic characteristics of emotional cognition. To address these challenges, we propose Reflective Reinforcement Learning for Emotional Reasoning (EMO-R3), a framework designed to enhance the emotional reasoning ability of MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Structured Emotional Thinking to guide the model to perform step-by-step emotional reasoning in a structured and interpretable manner, and design a Reflective Emotional Reward that enables the model to re-evaluate its reasoning based on visual-text consistency and emotional coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMO-R3 significantly improves both the interpretability and emotional intelligence of MLLMs, achieving superior performance across multiple visual emotional understanding benchmarks.

  Despite their capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) may produce plausible but erroneous outputs, hindering reliable deployment. Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation.

  The fast-growing demands in using Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex multi-step data science tasks create an emergent need for accurate benchmarking. There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released atthis https URL.

  We present a new approach for benchmarking Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities on research-level mathematics. Existing benchmarks largely rely on static, hand-curated sets of contest or textbook-style problems as proxies for mathematical research. Instead, we establish an updatable benchmark evaluating models directly on the latest research results in mathematics. This consists of an automatic pipeline that extracts lemmas from arXiv and rewrites them into self-contained statements by making all assumptions and required definitions explicit. It results in a benchmark that can be updated regularly with new problems taken directly from human mathematical research, while previous instances can be used for training without compromising future evaluations. We benchmark current state-of-the-art LLMs, which obtain around 10-15$\%$ accuracy in theorem proving (pass@1) depending on the model, showing that there is currently a large margin of progression for LLMs to reach human-level proving capabilities in a research context.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning aims to learn an agent from pre-collected datasets, avoiding unsafe and inefficient real-time interaction. However, inevitable access to out-ofdistribution actions during the learning process introduces approximation errors, causing the error accumulation and considerable overestimation. In this paper, we construct a new pessimistic auxiliary policy for sampling reliable actions. Specifically, we develop a pessimistic auxiliary strategy by maximizing the lower confidence bound of the Q-function. The pessimistic auxiliary strategy exhibits a relatively high value and low uncertainty in the vicinity of the learned policy, avoiding the learned policy sampling high-value actions with potentially high errors during the learning process. Less approximation error introduced by sampled action from pessimistic auxiliary strategy leads to the alleviation of error accumulation. Extensive experiments on offline reinforcement learning benchmarks reveal that utilizing the pessimistic auxiliary strategy can effectively improve the efficacy of other offline RL approaches.

  Multi-agent debate (MAD) systems leverage collective intelligence to enhance reasoning capabilities, yet existing approaches struggle to simultaneously optimize accuracy, consensus formation, and computational efficiency. Static topology methods lack adaptability to task complexity variations, while external LLM-based coordination risks introducing privileged knowledge that compromises debate neutrality. This work presents RUMAD (Reinforcement-Unifying Multi-Agent Debate), a novel framework that formulates dynamic communication topology control in MAD as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem.RUMAD employs a content-agnostic observation scheme that captures high-level debate dynamics avoiding access to raw agent reasoning content. RUMAD uses a multi-objective reward to model solution quality, cohesion and efficiency. A PPO-trained controller dynamically adjusts edge weights in the communication graph, while a dual-threshold mechanism enables fine-grained control over both agent activation and information visibility.Experimental evaluation across MMLU, GSM8K, and GPQA benchmarks demonstrates that RUMAD achieves substantial efficiency gains, reducing token costs by over 80\%, while still improving reasoning accuracy compared to single LLM model and multiple MAD baselines. Notably, RUMAD trained exclusively on MMLU exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, indicating that the learned communication strategies capture task-independent principles of effective multi-agent coordination. These results establish RUMAD as a efficient and robust approach for deploying multi-agent reasoning application with practical resource constraints.

  Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pursue omni-perception capabilities, yet integrating robust sensory grounding with complex reasoning remains a challenge, particularly for underrepresented regions. In this report, we introduce the research preview of MERaLiON2-Omni (Alpha), a 10B-parameter multilingual omni-perception tailored for Southeast Asia (SEA). We present a progressive training pipeline that explicitly decouples and then integrates "System 1" (Perception) and "System 2" (Reasoning) capabilities. First, we establish a robust Perception Backbone by aligning region-specific audio-visual cues (e.g., Singlish code-switching, local cultural landmarks) with a multilingual LLM through orthogonal modality adaptation. Second, to inject cognitive capabilities without large-scale supervision, we propose a cost-effective Generate-Judge-Refine pipeline. By utilizing a Super-LLM to filter hallucinations and resolve conflicts via a consensus mechanism, we synthesize high-quality silver data that transfers textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning to multimodal scenarios.Comprehensive evaluation on our newly introduced SEA-Omni Benchmark Suite reveals an Efficiency-Stability Paradox: while reasoning acts as a non-linear amplifier for abstract tasks (boosting mathematical and instruction-following performance significantly), it introduces instability in low-level sensory processing. Specifically, we identify Temporal Drift in long-context audio, where extended reasoning desynchronizes the model from acoustic timestamps, and Visual Over-interpretation, where logic overrides pixel-level reality. This report details the architecture, the data-efficient training recipe, and a diagnostic analysis of the trade-offs between robust perception and structured reasoning.

  The paradigm of large language model (LLM) reasoning is shifting from parameter scaling to test-time compute scaling, yet many existing approaches still rely on uniform brute-force sampling (for example, fixed best-of-N or self-consistency) that is costly, hard to attribute, and can trigger overthinking with diminishing returns. We propose ODAR-Expert, an adaptive routing framework that optimizes the accuracy-efficiency trade-off via principled resource allocation. ODAR uses a difficulty estimator grounded in amortized active inference to dynamically route queries between a heuristic Fast Agent and a deliberative Slow Agent. We further introduce a free-energy-principled, risk-sensitive fusion mechanism that selects answers by minimizing a variational free energy objective, balancing log-likelihood with epistemic uncertainty (varentropy) as a principled alternative to ad hoc voting over heterogeneous candidates. Extensive evaluation across 23 benchmarks shows strong and consistent gains, including 98.2% accuracy on MATH and 54.8% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), while improving the compute-accuracy frontier under compute-matched settings. We also validate reproducibility on a fully open-source stack (Llama 4 + DeepSeek), where ODAR surpasses homogeneous sampling strategies while reducing computational costs by 82%. Overall, our results suggest that thinking-optimal scaling requires adaptive resource allocation with free-energy-based decision-making rather than simply increasing test-time compute.

  Synthesizing high-quality training data is crucial for enhancing domain models' reasoning abilities. Existing methods face limitations in long-tail knowledge coverage, effectiveness verification, and interpretability. Knowledge-graph-based approaches still fall short in functionality, granularity, customizability, and evaluation. To address these issues, we propose MMKG-RDS, a flexible framework for reasoning data synthesis that leverages multimodal knowledge graphs. It supports fine-grained knowledge extraction, customizable path sampling, and multidimensional data quality scoring. We validate MMKG-RDS with the MMKG-RDS-Bench dataset, covering five domains, 17 task types, and 14,950 samples. Experimental results show fine-tuning Qwen3 models (0.6B/8B/32B) on a small number of synthesized samples improves reasoning accuracy by 9.2%. The framework also generates distinct data, challenging existing models on tasks involving tables and formulas, useful for complex benchmark construction.

  Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% feasibility, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 85.0% in the facility location domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

  Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have greatly improved their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chains of Thought (CoTs). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy, impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time applications. Recent studies show that longer reasoning chains are frequently uncorrelated with correctness and can even be detrimental to accuracy. In a further in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, we surprisingly uncover and empirically verify that LRMs implicitly know the appropriate time to stop thinking, while this capability is obscured by current sampling paradigms. Motivated by this, we introduce SAGE (Self-Aware Guided Efficient Reasoning), a novel sampling paradigm that unleashes this efficient reasoning potential. Furthermore, integrating SAGE as mixed sampling into group-based reinforcement learning (SAGE-RL) enables SAGE-RL to effectively incorporate SAGE-discovered efficient reasoning patterns into standard pass@1 inference, markedly enhancing both the reasoning accuracy and efficiency of LRMs across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks.

  Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) often suffer from hallucinations that stem not only from insufficient visual grounding but also from imbalanced allocation between perception and reasoning processes. Building upon recent interpretability findings suggesting a staged division of attention across layers, we analyze how this functional misalignment leads to two complementary failure modes: perceptual bias in shallow layers and reasoning drift in deeper layers. To alleviate these issues, we propose Functional Head Identification and Class-Conditioned Rescaling , a lightweight, training-free plugin that identifies perception- and reasoning-oriented heads and adaptively rebalances their layerwise contributions. Our method improves reasoning consistency and visual faithfulness without retraining or any architectural modification. Evaluations across three representative MLRMs and five multimodal reasoning benchmarks show an average 4.2% point gain, with less than 1% additional computation and only 9% baseline latency. Beyond empirical improvements, our study provides an interpretable perspective on regulating cross-layer functional dynamics to enhance the reliability of multimodal reasoning.

  Tree search has become as a representative framework for test-time reasoning with large language models (LLMs), exemplified by methods such as Tree-of-Thought and Monte Carlo Tree Search. However, it remains difficult to provide instant and reliable quantitative assessments of intermediate reasoning step quality, and extensive path exploration is computationally costly. To address this, we propose Mutual Information Tree Search (MITS), a novel framework that guides reasoning with information-theoretic principles. MITS introduces an effective scoring function based on pointwise mutual information (PMI), which enables step-wise evaluation of reasoning paths and search tree expansion via beam search without expensive look-ahead simulations, achieving superior reasoning performances while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is complemented by an entropy-based dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively allocates computational resources to uncertain reasoning steps where exploration is most beneficial. For final prediction, MITS employs a weighted voting scheme that combines PMI scores with prediction consensus. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks, MITS consistently surpasses baseline methods, establishing a principled and efficient framework for LLM reasoning.
