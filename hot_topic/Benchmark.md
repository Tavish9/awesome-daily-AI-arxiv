- **[RayFronts: Open-Set Semantic Ray Frontiers for Online Scene Understanding and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06994)**  `arXiv:2504.06994`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  Open-set semantic mapping is crucial for open-world robots. Current mapping approaches either are limited by the depth range or only map beyond-range entities in constrained settings, where overall they fail to combine within-range and beyond-range observations. Furthermore, these methods make a trade-off between fine-grained semantics and efficiency. We introduce RayFronts, a unified representation that enables both dense and beyond-range efficient semantic mapping. RayFronts encodes task-agnostic open-set semantics to both in-range voxels and beyond-range rays encoded at map boundaries, empowering the robot to reduce search volumes significantly and make informed decisions both within & beyond sensory range, while running at 8.84 Hz on an Orin AGX. Benchmarking the within-range semantics shows that RayFronts's fine-grained image encoding provides 1.34x zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation performance while improving throughput by 16.5x. Traditionally, online mapping performance is entangled with other system components, complicating evaluation. We propose a planner-agnostic evaluation framework that captures the utility for online beyond-range search and exploration, and show RayFronts reduces search volume 2.2x more efficiently than the closest online baselines.

- **[Developing Modular Grasping and Manipulation Pipeline Infrastructure to Streamline Performance Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06819)**  `arXiv:2504.06819`  `cs.RO`  
  _Brian Flynn, Kostas Bekris, Berk Calli, Aaron Dollar, Adam Norton, Yu Sun, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The robot manipulation ecosystem currently faces issues with integrating open-source components and reproducing results. This limits the ability of the community to benchmark and compare the performance of different solutions to one another in an effective manner, instead relying on largely holistic evaluations. As part of the COMPARE Ecosystem project, we are developing modular grasping and manipulation pipeline infrastructure in order to streamline performance benchmarking. The infrastructure will be used towards the establishment of standards and guidelines for modularity and improved open-source development and benchmarking. This paper provides a high-level overview of the architecture of the pipeline infrastructure, experiments conducted to exercise it during development, and future work to expand its modularity.

- **[Benchmarking Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Neural Network based Surrogate Models on a Real-World Car External Aerodynamics Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06699)**  `arXiv:2504.06699`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aerodynamic optimization is crucial for developing eco-friendly, aerodynamic, and stylish cars, which requires close collaboration between aerodynamicists and stylists, a collaboration impaired by the time-consuming nature of aerodynamic simulations. Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries, our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3 drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation. However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of the geometry.

- **[HoTPP Benchmark: Are We Good at the Long Horizon Events Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14341)**  `arXiv:2406.14341`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ivan Karpukhin, Foma Shipilov, Andrey Savchenko_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forecasting multiple future events within a given time horizon is essential for applications in finance, retail, social networks, and healthcare. Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP) provide a principled framework to model both the timing and labels of events. However, most existing research focuses on predicting only the next event, leaving long-horizon forecasting largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce HoTPP, the first benchmark specifically designed to rigorously evaluate long-horizon predictions. We identify shortcomings in widely used evaluation metrics, propose a theoretically grounded T-mAP metric, present strong statistical baselines, and offer efficient implementations of popular models. Our empirical results demonstrate that modern MTPP approaches often underperform simple statistical baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the diversity of predicted sequences and find that most methods exhibit mode collapse. Finally, we analyze the impact of autoregression and intensity-based losses on prediction quality, and outline promising directions for future research. The HoTPP source code, hyperparameters, and full evaluation results are available on GitHub.

- **[Unsolvable Problem Detection: Robust Understanding Evaluation for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20331)**  `arXiv:2403.20331`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed $\textbf{Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD)}$. Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.

- **[SketchRef: a Multi-Task Evaluation Benchmark for Sketch Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08623)**  `arXiv:2408.08623`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`  
  _Xingyue Lin, Xingjian Hu, Shuai Peng, Jianhua Zhu, Liangcai Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sketching is a powerful artistic technique for capturing essential visual information about real-world objects and has increasingly attracted attention in image synthesis research. However, the field lacks a unified benchmark to evaluate the performance of various synthesis methods. To address this, we propose SketchRef, the first comprehensive multi-task evaluation benchmark for sketch synthesis. SketchRef fully leverages the shared characteristics between sketches and reference photos. It introduces two primary tasks: category prediction and structural consistency estimation, the latter being largely overlooked in previous studies. These tasks are further divided into five sub-tasks across four domains: animals, common things, human body, and faces. Recognizing the inherent trade-off between recognizability and simplicity in sketches, we are the first to quantify this balance by introducing a recognizability calculation method constrained by simplicity, mRS, ensuring fair and meaningful evaluations. To validate our approach, we collected 7,920 responses from art enthusiasts, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of existing sketch synthesis methods on our benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We hope this study establishes a standardized benchmark and offers valuable insights for advancing sketch synthesis algorithms.

  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

- **[Benchmarking Multimodal CoT Reward Model Stepwise by Visual Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06606)**  `arXiv:2504.06606`  `cs.CV`  
  _Minghe Gao, Xuqi Liu, Zhongqi Yue, Yang Wu, Shuang Chen, Juncheng Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in reward signal usage for Large Language Models (LLMs) are remarkable. However, significant challenges exist when transitioning reward signal to the multimodal domain, including labor-intensive annotations, over-reliance on one-step rewards, and inadequate evaluation. To address these issues, we propose SVIP, a novel approach to train a step-level multi-dimensional Chain-of-Thought~(CoT) reward model automatically. It generates code for solving visual tasks and transforms the analysis of code blocks into the evaluation of CoT step as training samples. Then, we train SVIP-Reward model using a multi-head attention mechanism called TriAtt-CoT. The advantages of SVIP-Reward are evident throughout the entire process of MLLM. We also introduce a benchmark for CoT reward model training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that SVIP-Reward improves MLLM performance across training and inference-time scaling, yielding better results on benchmarks while reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning ability.

- **[End-to-End Driving with Online Trajectory Evaluation via BEV World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01941)**  `arXiv:2504.01941`  `cs.CV`  
  _Yingyan Li, Yuqi Wang, Yang Liu, Jiawei He, Lue Fan, Zhaoxiang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress by integrating perception, prediction, and planning into a fully differentiable framework. Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is released atthis https URL.

- **[FIORD: A Fisheye Indoor-Outdoor Dataset with LIDAR Ground Truth for 3D Scene Reconstruction and Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01732)**  `arXiv:2504.01732`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ulas Gunes, Matias Turkulainen, Xuqian Ren, Arno Solin, Juho Kannala, Esa Rahtu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis methods mostly rely on datasets comprising perspective images with narrow fields of view (FoV). While effective for small-scale scenes, these datasets require large image sets and extensive structure-from-motion (SfM) processing, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a fisheye image dataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye lenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor scenes. Each scene has sparse SfM point clouds and precise LIDAR-derived dense point clouds that can be used as geometric ground-truth, enabling robust benchmarking under challenging conditions such as occlusions and reflections. While the baseline experiments focus on vanilla Gaussian Splatting and NeRF based Nerfacto methods, the dataset supports diverse approaches for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and image-based rendering.

- **[AuroraCap: Efficient, Performant Video Detailed Captioning and a New Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03051)**  `arXiv:2410.03051`  `cs.CV`  
  _Wenhao Chai, Enxin Song, Yilun Du, Chenlin Meng, Vashisht Madhavan, Omer Bar-Tal, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality.

- **[CroissantLLM: A Truly Bilingual French-English Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00786)**  `arXiv:2402.00786`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Manuel Faysse, Patrick Fernandes, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Ant√≥nio Loison, Duarte M. Alves, Caio Corro, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CroissantLLM, a 1.3B language model pretrained on a set of 3T English and French tokens, to bring to the research and industrial community a high-performance, fully open-sourced bilingual model that runs swiftly on consumer-grade local hardware. To that end, we pioneer the approach of training an intrinsically bilingual model with a 1:1 English-to-French pretraining data ratio, a custom tokenizer, and bilingual finetuning datasets. We release the training dataset, notably containing a French split with manually curated, high-quality, and varied data sources. To assess performance outside of English, we craft a novel benchmark, FrenchBench, consisting of an array of classification and generation tasks, covering various orthogonal aspects of model performance in the French Language. Additionally, rooted in transparency and to foster further Large Language Model research, we release codebases, and dozens of checkpoints across various model sizes, training data distributions, and training steps, as well as fine-tuned Chat models, and strong translation models. We evaluate our model through the FMTI framework, and validate 81 % of the transparency criteria, far beyond the scores of even most open initiatives. This work enriches the NLP landscape, breaking away from previous English-centric work in order to strengthen our understanding of multilinguality in language models.

- **[Lugha-Llama: Adapting Large Language Models for African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06536)**  `arXiv:2504.06536`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Happy Buzaaba, Alexander Wettig, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Christiane Fellbaum_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in a wide range of natural language applications. However, they often struggle to recognize low-resource languages, in particular African languages, which are not well represented in large training corpora. In this paper, we consider how to adapt LLMs to low-resource African languages. We find that combining curated data from African languages with high-quality English educational texts results in a training mix that substantially improves the model's performance on these languages. On the challenging IrokoBench dataset, our models consistently achieve the best performance amongst similarly sized baselines, particularly on knowledge-intensive multiple-choice questions (AfriMMLU). Additionally, on the cross-lingual question answering benchmark AfriQA, our models outperform the base model by over 10%. To better understand the role of English data during training, we translate a subset of 200M tokens into Swahili language and perform an analysis which reveals that the content of these data is primarily responsible for the strong performance. We release our models and data to encourage future research on African languages.

- **[PRMBench: A Fine-grained and Challenging Benchmark for Process-Level Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03124)**  `arXiv:2501.03124`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Mingyang Song, Zhaochen Su, Xiaoye Qu, Jiawei Zhou, Yu Cheng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks, where each intermediate step plays an important role in the reasoning process. Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 15 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research. We hope PRMBench can be a robust bench for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development.

- **[HalluciNot: Hallucination Detection Through Context and Common Knowledge Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07069)**  `arXiv:2504.07069`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Bibek Paudel, Alexander Lyzhov, Preetam Joshi, Puneet Anand_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a comprehensive system for detecting hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs in enterprise settings. We present a novel taxonomy of LLM responses specific to hallucination in enterprise applications, categorizing them into context-based, common knowledge, enterprise-specific, and innocuous statements. Our hallucination detection model HDM-2 validates LLM responses with respect to both context and generally known facts (common knowledge). It provides both hallucination scores and word-level annotations, enabling precise identification of problematic content. To evaluate it on context-based and common-knowledge hallucinations, we introduce a new dataset HDMBench. Experimental results demonstrate that HDM-2 out-performs existing approaches across RagTruth, TruthfulQA, and HDMBench datasets. This work addresses the specific challenges of enterprise deployment, including computational efficiency, domain specialization, and fine-grained error identification. Our evaluation dataset, model weights, and inference code are publicly available.

- **[Can LLMs Simulate Personas with Reversed Performance? A Benchmark for Counterfactual Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06460)**  `arXiv:2504.06460`  `cs.CL`  
  _Sai Adith Senthil Kumar, Hao Yan, Saipavan Perepa, Murong Yue, Ziyu Yao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.

- **[PingPong: A Benchmark for Role-Playing Language Models with User Emulation and Multi-Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06820)**  `arXiv:2409.06820`  `cs.CL`  
  _Ilya Gusev_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a benchmark for evaluating the role-playing capabilities of language models. Our approach leverages different language models to simulate users in dynamic, multi-turn conversations and assess the resulting dialogues. Our methodology involves three main components: a player model that adopts a specific character role, an interrogator model that simulates user behavior in a specific situation, and a judge model ensemble that evaluates conversation quality with 3 metrics: character consistency, entertainment value, and language fluency. We evaluated more than 40 models in both English and Russian, with each model participating in 64 conversations with 8 characters and 8 situations. We conducted experiments comparing automated evaluations with human annotations to validate our approach, demonstrating strong correlations across multiple criteria. This work provides a foundation for a robust and dynamic evaluation of different model capabilities in interactive scenarios.

- **[FamilyTool: A Multi-hop Personalized Tool Use Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06766)**  `arXiv:2504.06766`  `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yuxin Wang, Yiran Guo, Yining Zheng, Zhangyue Yin, Shuo Chen, Jie Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool use scenarios. FamilyTool challenges LLMs with queries spanning 1 to 3 relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and scalability in complex, dynamic environments. Code and dataset are available at Github.
