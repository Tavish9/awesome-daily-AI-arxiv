- **[Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799)**  `arXiv:2506.15799`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Andrew Wagenmaker, Mitsuhiko Nakamoto, Yunchu Zhang, Seohong Park, Waleed Yagoub, Anusha Nagabandi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

- **[STEP Planner: Constructing cross-hierarchical subgoal tree as an embodied long-horizon task planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21030)**  `arXiv:2506.21030`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zhou Tianxing, Wang Zhirui, Ao Haojia, Chen Guangyan, Xing Boyang, Cheng Jingwen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and 25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

- **[Flow-Based Single-Step Completion for Efficient and Expressive Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21427)**  `arXiv:2506.21427`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Prajwal Koirala, Cody Fleming_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models such as diffusion and flow-matching offer expressive policies for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by capturing rich, multimodal action distributions, but their iterative sampling introduces high inference costs and training instability due to gradient propagation across sampling steps. We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate, one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.

- **[RL-Selector: Reinforcement Learning-Guided Data Selection via Redundancy Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21037)**  `arXiv:2506.21037`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Suorong Yang, Peijia Li, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.

- **[Chain-of-Sketch: Enabling Global Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08165)**  `arXiv:2410.08165`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Aryo Lotfi, Enrico Fini, Samy Bengio, Moin Nabi, Emmanuel Abbe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly, state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task. In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to non-inductive variants.

- **[mTSBench: Benchmarking Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection and Model Selection at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21550)**  `arXiv:2506.21550`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiaona Zhou, Constantin Brif, Ismini Lourentzou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTS-AD) is critical in domains like healthcare, cybersecurity, and industrial monitoring, yet remains challenging due to complex inter-variable dependencies, temporal dynamics, and sparse anomaly labels. We introduce mTSBench, the largest benchmark to date for MTS-AD and unsupervised model selection, spanning 344 labeled time series across 19 datasets and 12 diverse application domains. mTSBench evaluates 24 anomaly detection methods, including large language model (LLM)-based detectors for multivariate time series, and systematically benchmarks unsupervised model selection techniques under standardized conditions. Consistent with prior findings, our results confirm that no single detector excels across datasets, underscoring the importance of model selection. However, even state-of-the-art selection methods remain far from optimal, revealing critical gaps. mTSBench provides a unified evaluation suite to enable rigorous, reproducible comparisons and catalyze future advances in adaptive anomaly detection and robust model selection.

- **[Process mining-driven modeling and simulation to enhance fault diagnosis in cyber-physical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21502)**  `arXiv:2506.21502`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Francesco Vitale, Nicola Dall'Ora, Sebastiano Gaiardelli, Enrico Fraccaroli, Nicola Mazzocca, Franco Fummi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fault diagnosis in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is essential for ensuring system dependability and operational efficiency by accurately detecting anomalies and identifying their root causes. However, the manual modeling of faulty behaviors often demands extensive domain expertise and produces models that are complex, error-prone, and difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, we present a novel unsupervised fault diagnosis methodology that integrates collective anomaly detection in multivariate time series, process mining, and stochastic simulation. Initially, collective anomalies are detected from low-level sensor data using multivariate time-series analysis. These anomalies are then transformed into structured event logs, enabling the discovery of interpretable process models through process mining. By incorporating timing distributions into the extracted Petri nets, the approach supports stochastic simulation of faulty behaviors, thereby enhancing root cause analysis and behavioral understanding. The methodology is validated using the Robotic Arm Dataset (RoAD), a widely recognized benchmark in smart manufacturing. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in modeling, simulating, and classifying faulty behaviors in CPSs. This enables the creation of comprehensive fault dictionaries that support predictive maintenance and the development of digital twins for industrial environments.

- **[Optimising 4th-Order Runge-Kutta Methods: A Dynamic Heuristic Approach for Efficiency and Low Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21465)**  `arXiv:2506.21465`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Gavin Lee Goodship, Luis Miralles-Pechuan, Stephen O'Sullivan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extended Stability Runge-Kutta (ESRK) methods are crucial for solving large-scale computational problems in science and engineering, including weather forecasting, aerodynamic analysis, and complex biological modelling. However, balancing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency remains challenging, particularly for high-order, low-storage schemes. This study introduces a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for automated heuristic discovery, optimising low-storage ESRK methods. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on manually designed heuristics or exhaustive numerical searches, our method leverages GA-driven mutations for search-space exploration and an RL-inspired state transition mechanism to refine heuristic selection dynamically. This enables systematic parameter reduction, preserving fourth-order accuracy while significantly improving computationalthis http URLproposed GA-RL heuristic optimisation framework is validated through rigorous testing on benchmark problems, including the 1D and 2D Brusselator systems and the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations. The best-performing heuristic achieves a 25\% reduction in IPOPT runtime compared to traditional ESRK optimisation processes while maintaining numerical stability and accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of adaptive heuristic discovery to improve resource efficiency in high-fidelity simulations and broaden the applicability of low-storage Runge-Kutta methods in real-world computational fluid dynamics, physics simulations, and other demanding fields. This work establishes a new paradigm in heuristic optimisation for numerical methods, opening pathways for further exploration using Deep RL and AutoML-based heuristic search

- **[FeDa4Fair: Client-Level Federated Datasets for Fairness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21095)**  `arXiv:2506.21095`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xenia Heilmann, Luca Corbucci, Mattia Cerrato, Anna Monreale_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways: (1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

- **[Strict Subgoal Execution: Reliable Long-Horizon Planning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21039)**  `arXiv:2506.21039`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jaebak Hwang, Sanghyeon Lee, Jeongmo Kim, Seungyul Han_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks pose fundamental challenges for reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when goals are distant and rewards are sparse. While hierarchical and graph-based methods offer partial solutions, they often suffer from subgoal infeasibility and inefficient planning. We introduce Strict Subgoal Execution (SSE), a graph-based hierarchical RL framework that enforces single-step subgoal reachability by structurally constraining high-level decision-making. To enhance exploration, SSE employs a decoupled exploration policy that systematically traverses underexplored regions of the goal space. Furthermore, a failure-aware path refinement, which refines graph-based planning by dynamically adjusting edge costs according to observed low-level success rates, thereby improving subgoal reliability. Experimental results across diverse long-horizon benchmarks demonstrate that SSE consistently outperforms existing goal-conditioned RL and hierarchical RL approaches in both efficiency and success rate.

- **[Antibody Design and Optimization with Multi-scale Equivariant Graph Diffusion Models for Accurate Complex Antigen Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20957)**  `arXiv:2506.20957`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiameng Chen, Xiantao Cai, Jia Wu, Wenbin Hu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces. Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph \textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\% rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~√Ö reduction in root mean square deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization.

- **[Interpretable Representation Learning for Additive Rule Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20927)**  `arXiv:2506.20927`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shahrzad Behzadimanesh, Pierre Le Bodic, Geoffrey I. Webb, Mario Boley_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small additive ensembles of symbolic rules offer interpretable prediction models. Traditionally, these ensembles use rule conditions based on conjunctions of simple threshold propositions $x \geq t$ on a single input variable $x$ and threshold $t$, resulting geometrically in axis-parallel polytopes as decision regions. While this form ensures a high degree of interpretability for individual rules and can be learned efficiently using the gradient boosting approach, it relies on having access to a curated set of expressive and ideally independent input features so that a small ensemble of axis-parallel regions can describe the target variable well. Absent such features, reaching sufficient accuracy requires increasing the number and complexity of individual rules, which diminishes the interpretability of the model. Here, we extend classical rule ensembles by introducing logical propositions with learnable sparse linear transformations of input variables, i.e., propositions of the form $\mathbf{x}^\mathrm{T}\mathbf{w} \geq t$, where $\mathbf{w}$ is a learnable sparse weight vector, enabling decision regions as general polytopes with oblique faces. We propose a learning method using sequential greedy optimization based on an iteratively reweighted formulation of logistic regression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently constructs rule ensembles with the same test risk as state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity across ten benchmark datasets.

- **[Composite Flow Matching for Reinforcement Learning with Shifted-Dynamics Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23062)**  `arXiv:2505.23062`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Lingkai Kong, Haichuan Wang, Tonghan Wang, Guojun Xiong, Milind Tambe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.

  _Ziyue Li, Chenrui Fan, Tianyi Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grokking, i.e., test performance keeps improving long after training loss converged, has been recently witnessed in neural network training, making the mechanism of generalization and other emerging capabilities such as reasoning mysterious. While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or highly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of grokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language model (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate generalization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code generation, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the pretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter grokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's "emergence of generalization" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find that training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve from random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples during grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the converged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion, providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a single pathway. We show their ability to predict the generalization improvement on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient, simple to compute and solely dependent on training data. Hence, they have practical value for pretraining, enabling us to monitor the generalization performance without finetuning and test. Theoretically, we show that more structured pathways reduce model complexity and improve the generalization bound.

- **[SMMILE: An Expert-Driven Benchmark for Multimodal Medical In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21355)**  `arXiv:2506.21355`  `cs.LG`  
  _Melanie Rieff, Maya Varma, Ossian Rabow, Subathra Adithan, Julie Kim, Ken Chang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) remains underexplored despite significant potential for domains such as medicine. Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias, i.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context.

  _Jingyao Li, Hao Sun, Zile Qiao, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on static evaluations through storytelling or opinion expression, which fail to capture the dynamic requirements of real-time information processing in contemporary applications. To address this limitation, we present DynamicBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in storing and processing up-to-the-minute data. DynamicBench utilizes a dual-path retrieval pipeline, integrating web searches with local report databases. It necessitates domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate responses report generation within specialized fields. By evaluating models in scenarios that either provide or withhold external documents, DynamicBench effectively measures their capability to independently process recent information or leverage contextual enhancements. Additionally, we introduce an advanced report generation system adept at managing dynamic information synthesis. Our experimental results confirm the efficacy of our approach, with our method achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT4o in document-free and document-assisted scenarios by 7.0% and 5.8%, respectively. The code and data will be made publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may include private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data that degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more flexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.

  Ensemble learning has proven effective in boosting predictive performance, but traditional methods such as bagging, boosting, and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) suffer from high computational cost and limited adaptability to heterogeneous data distributions. To address these limitations, we propose Hellsemble, a novel and interpretable ensemble framework for binary classification that leverages dataset complexity during both training and inference. Hellsemble incrementally partitions the dataset into circles of difficulty by iteratively passing misclassified instances from simpler models to subsequent ones, forming a committee of specialised base learners. Each model is trained on increasingly challenging subsets, while a separate router model learns to assign new instances to the most suitable base model based on inferred difficulty. Hellsemble achieves strong classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and interpretability. Experimental results on OpenML-CC18 and Tabzilla benchmarks demonstrate that Hellsemble often outperforms classical ensemble methods. Our findings suggest that embracing instance-level difficulty offers a promising direction for constructing efficient and robust ensemble systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.

- **[Fairly Accurate: Fairness-aware Multi-group Target Detection in Online Discussion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11933)**  `arXiv:2407.11933`  `cs.LG`  
  _Soumyajit Gupta, Maria De-Arteaga, Matthew Lease_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Target-group detection is the task of detecting which group(s) a social media post is ``directed at or about'', with various applications, such as targeted-marketing. In this work, we focus on the fairness implications of target-group detection in the context of toxicity detection, where the perceived harm of a post often depends on which group(s) it targets. Because toxicity is highly contextual, language that appears benign in general may be harmful when targeting specific demographic groups. It is thus important to first detect which group(s) are being {\em targeted} by a post as a precursor to the subsequent task of determining whether the post is toxic given the group(s). Target-group detection is also challenging: a single post may simultaneously target one to many groups, and we must detect groups fairly in order to promote equitable treatment. We show that our proposed approach to {\em fairness-aware multi target-group detection} not only reduces bias across groups, but also achieves competitive predictive performance, outperforming existing fairness-aware baselines. To spur future research on fairness-aware target-group detection and support competitive benchmarking, we also share our code.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse & nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.

- **[Pushing Trade-Off Boundaries: Compact yet Effective Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21109)**  `arXiv:2506.21109`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Luosheng Xu, Dalin Zhang, Zhaohui Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (<1\% F1) accuracy trade-off.

  Neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning sequences of tasks or data streams, unlike humans who can continuously learn and consolidate new concepts even in the absence of explicit cues. Online data-incremental learning seeks to emulate this capability by processing each sample only once, without having access to task or stream cues at any point in time since this is more realistic compared to offline setups, where all data from novel class(es) is assumed to be readily available. However, existing methods typically rely on storing the subsets of data in memory or expanding the initial model architecture, resulting in significant computational overhead. Drawing inspiration from 'self-regulated neurogenesis'-brain's mechanism for creating specialized regions or circuits for distinct functions-we propose a novel approach SERENA which encodes each concept in a specialized network path called 'concept cell', integrated into a single over-parameterized network. Once a concept is learned, its corresponding concept cell is frozen, effectively preventing the forgetting of previously acquired information. Furthermore, we introduce two new continual learning scenarios that more closely reflect real-world conditions, characterized by gradually changing sample sizes. Experimental results show that our method not only establishes new state-of-the-art results across ten benchmarks but also remarkably surpasses offline supervised batch learning performance.

  With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs, directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information. To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

  Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available atthis https URL.

  This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.

  Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.

  Long-form video understanding presents unique challenges that extend beyond traditional short-video analysis approaches, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies, processing redundant information efficiently, and extracting high-level semantic concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD) problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source (easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7 percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks, respectively.

  Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.

  Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.

  Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success, current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.

  Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.

These questions are divided into 3 major task types and 12 sub-task types to achieve comprehensive evaluation. Among them, we introduce a more granular video localization task named Grounding. Then we conduct experiments on OmniEval with several omni-modality models.

  Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available. Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.

  Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components: semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition. We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.

  Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

  Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.

  The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.

  Open-set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where novel classes - also referred to as target-private unknown classes - are present. Source-free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods address OSDA without accessing labeled source data, making them particularly relevant under privacy constraints. However, SF-OSDA presents significant challenges due to distribution shifts and the introduction of novel classes. Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on thresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a known or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features for the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a novel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly learning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage process. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by training a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by synthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the classifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt the entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and distinguishability to unknown classes. Any off-the-shelf source-free domain adaptation method (e.g. SHOT, AaD) can be seamlessly integrated into our framework at this stage. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA methods.

  Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours, unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.

  We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume. Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing: single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

  Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge, especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image, they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image, enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs. Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x faster than methods with similar performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++ training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135, 0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning and model fine-tuning techniques.

  This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2) anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression. For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our approach under 1/2/4-shots.

  Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce \textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct \textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.

  Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images. Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions. We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS. Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.

  Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2% compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for human-centric visual understanding. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA) systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning. Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in real-world, text-centric scenarios. Code and dataset has been made available atthis https URL.

  Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering ($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.

  Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

  Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

  Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust, domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.

  Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures. Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance, existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion. Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM) that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and scales.

  Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1 lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration. Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions, such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient, multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object. We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch, balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on 3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

  Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects. First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss. Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation and roboticthis http URLpage:this https URL

  Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability. Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models (LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue. The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data. Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline. Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs.

  Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives; however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting (DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.

  Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets. Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically, we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.

  Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors; however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation, of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.

  Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across unseen domains.

  We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$ search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$ search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$ search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.

  Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

  Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset. This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS 2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893, respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding boxes or nnU-Net.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints. Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance, showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.

  _Qin Ren, Yifan Wang, Ruogu Fang, Haibin Ling, Chenyu You_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

  Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions, sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models, offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth Observation applications.

  Using natural language to query visual information is a fundamental need in real-world applications. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE), which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved retrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.

  Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.

  The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

  With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, a lack of data has become a major obstacle to enhancing perception model accuracy. Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous driving scenarios. All the data and code will be available atthis https URL.

  Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries is essential for effective crop monitoring and resource management. However, competing methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1) or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2 datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms. Our results consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting excellent global transferability and robustness. Crucially, our approach significantly simplifies data preparation workflows by reliably processing cloud-affected imagery, thereby offering strong adaptability across diverse agricultural environments.

  Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.

  Although multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable performance across benchmarks, we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin script languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation from both leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.

  Large language models (LLMs) are regularly evaluated using benchmark datasets. But what justifies making inferences about an LLM's capabilities based on its answers to a curated set of questions? This paper first introduces a formal framework to address this question. The key is to note that the benchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test people. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid tests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human misunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin understanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable with how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for quantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed benchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a lower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across models, tasks, and domains. We also find that these failures reflect not just incorrect understanding, but deeper internal incoherence in concept representations.

  As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence. However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at github.

  Advanced intelligent systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are significantly reshaping financial practices through advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the extent to which these models effectively capture and apply domain-specific financial knowledge remains uncertain. Addressing a critical gap in the expansive Indian financial context, this paper introduces CA-Ben, a Chartered Accountancy benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the financial, legal, and quantitative reasoning capabilities of LLMs. CA-Ben comprises structured question-answer datasets derived from the rigorous examinations conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), spanning foundational, intermediate, and advanced CA curriculum stages. Six prominent LLMs i.e. GPT 4o, LLAMA 3.3 70B, LLAMA 3.1 405B, MISTRAL Large, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Microsoft Phi 4 were evaluated using standardized protocols. Results indicate variations in performance, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o outperforming others, especially in conceptual and legal reasoning. Notable challenges emerged in numerical computations and legal interpretations. The findings emphasize the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, suggesting future improvements through hybrid reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation methods, particularly for quantitative analysis and accurate legal interpretation.

  Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in NLP, yet adapting them efficiently and robustly to specific tasks remains challenging. As their scale and complexity grow, fine-tuning LMs on labelled data often underutilizes available unlabelled data, leads to overfitting on small task-specific sets, and imposes significant computational costs. These limitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world language tasks.This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream applications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant knowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training technique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next, we present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces memory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also introduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better follow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their performance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation. Finally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more comprehensively.Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results demonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness, efficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of applications. These advances mark a significant step towards more robust and efficient LMs, bringing us closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.

Our discoveries include: (1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is irrelevant. Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval / MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance (e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

  Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning, have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability. Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO. Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% - 90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

  Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. The code is available atthis https URL.

  We investigate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large language models when transitioning from offline to semi-online to fully online regimes for both verifiable and non-verifiable tasks. Our experiments cover training on verifiable math as well as non-verifiable instruction following with a set of benchmark evaluations for both. Across these settings, we extensively compare online and semi-online Direct Preference Optimization and Group Reward Policy Optimization objectives, and surprisingly find similar performance and convergence between these variants, which all strongly outperform offline methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the training dynamics and hyperparameter selection strategies to achieve optimal results. Finally, we show that multi-tasking with verifiable and non-verifiable rewards jointly yields improved performance across both task types.

  While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

  In this paper, we propose KaLM-Embedding-V2, a versatile and compact embedding model, which achieves impressive performance in general-purpose text embedding tasks by leveraging superior training techniques and data. Our key innovations include: (1) To better align the architecture with representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask and adopt a fully bidirectional transformer with simple yet effective mean-pooling to produce fixed-length embeddings; (2) We employ a multi-stage training pipeline: (i) pre-training on large-scale weakly supervised open-source corpora; (ii) fine-tuning on high-quality retrieval and non-retrieval datasets; and (iii) model-soup parameter averaging for robust generalization. Besides, we introduce a focal-style reweighting mechanism that concentrates learning on difficult samples and an online hard-negative mixing strategy to continuously enrich hard negatives without expensive offline mining; (3) We collect over 20 categories of data for pre-training and 100 categories of data for fine-tuning, to boost both the performance and generalization of the embedding model. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Chinese and English show that our model significantly outperforms others of comparable size, and competes with 3x, 14x, 18x, and 26x larger embedding models, setting a new standard for a versatile and compact embedding model with less than 1B parameters.

  Multi-lingual competence in large language models is often evaluated via static data benchmarks such as Belebele, M-MMLU and M-GSM. However, these evaluations often fail to provide an adequate understanding of the practical performance and robustness of models across multi-lingual settings. In response, we create multi-lingual functional benchmarks -- Cross-Lingual Grade School Math Symbolic (CL-GSM Symbolic) and Cross-Lingual Instruction-Following Eval (CL-IFEval)-- by translating existing functional benchmark templates from English to five additional languages that span the range of resources available for NLP: French, Spanish, Hindi, Arabic and Yoruba. Our results reveal that some static multi-lingual benchmarks capture functional performance much more closely than others (i.e. across models, there is a 24%, 17% and 18% decrease in performance between M-GSM and CL-GSM Symbolic in English, French and Spanish respectively; similarly there's a 15 - 24% performance drop across languages between Belebele and CL-IFEval, and only a 0.5% to 3% performance drop between M-MMLU and CL-IFEval). Similarly, we find that model robustness across languages varies significantly, with certain languages (eg. Arabic, English) being the most consistently well performing across evaluation iterations.

  Current approaches for question answering (QA) over tabular data, such as NL2SQL systems, perform well for factual questions where answers are directly retrieved from tables. However, they fall short on probabilistic questions requiring reasoning under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark LUCARIO and a framework for probabilistic QA over large tabular data. Our method induces Bayesian Networks from tables, translates natural language queries into probabilistic queries, and uses large language models (LLMs) to generate final answers. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, highlighting the benefits of hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning.

  Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR bias during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework.this https URL.

  Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite its substantial impact on various search, recommendation, and question answering tasks, privacy-preserving methods for personalizing large language models (LLMs) have received relatively limited exploration. There is one primary approach in this area through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which generates personalized outputs by enriching the input prompt with information retrieved from the user's personal data. This paper studies an orthogonal approach to RAG that involves learning user-dependent LLM parameters through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents the first systematic study for exploration of PEFT for LLM personalization and provides an extensive comparisons between RAG- and PEFT-based solutions, across a broad set of seven diverse datasets from the LaMP benchmark. Our results demonstrate that, on average, both RAG- and PEFT-based personalization methods yield 14.92% and 1.07% improvements over non-personalized LLMs, respectively. When combining RAG with PEFT, we observe a further improvement of 15.98%, highlighting the effectiveness of their integration in enhancing personalized text generation. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between the amount of user data available and the effectiveness of PEFT. This finding suggests that RAG is particularly beneficial for cold-start users -- users with limited personal data -- while PEFT performs better when more user-specific data is available.

  Automatic evaluation of sequence generation, traditionally reliant on metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, often fails to capture the semantic accuracy of generated text sequences due to their emphasis on n-gram overlap. A promising solution to this problem is to develop model-based metrics, such as BLEURT and COMET. However, these approaches are typically hindered by the scarcity of labeled evaluation data, which is necessary to train the evaluation models. In this work, we build upon this challenge by proposing the Customized Sequence Evaluation Metric (CSEM), a three-stage evaluation model training method that utilizes large language models to generate labeled data for model-based metric development, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled data. Additionally, we expand the scope of CSEM to support various evaluation types, including single-aspect, multi-aspect, reference-free, and reference-based evaluations, enabling the customization of metrics to suit diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that CSEM can effectively train an evaluation model without human-labeled data. Further experiments in reinforcement learning and reranking show that metrics developed through CSEM outperform traditional evaluation metrics, leading to substantial improvements in sequence quality as evaluated by both commonly used metrics and ChatGPT.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a 60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

  Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal. Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024, whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2.

  Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance. Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations (perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements). We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of unobservable space.

  Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web 2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system, OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next generation of agentic search systems.

  Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of 100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse, non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks (AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer agents.

  The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158 real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models, including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in 59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions. Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios. These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

  Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur, skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula) and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML, Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of 1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA, WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table understanding.

  Being able to cooperate with new people is an important component of many economically valuable AI tasks, from household robotics to autonomous driving. However, generalizing to novel humans requires training on data that captures the diversity of human behaviors. Adversarial training is a promising method that allows dynamic data generation and ensures that agents are robust. It creates a feedback loop where the agent's performance influences the generation of new adversarial data, which can be used immediately to train the agent. However, adversarial training is difficult to apply in a cooperative task; how can we train an adversarial cooperator? We propose a novel strategy that combines a pretrained generative model to simulate valid cooperative agent policies with adversarial training to maximize regret. We call our method GOAT: Generative Online Adversarial Training. In this framework, the GOAT dynamically searches the latent space of the generative model for coordination strategies where the learning policy, the Cooperator agent, underperforms. GOAT enables better generalization by exposing the Cooperator to various challenging interaction scenarios. We maintain realistic coordination strategies by keeping the generative model frozen, thus avoiding adversarial exploitation. We evaluate GOAT with real human partners, and the results demonstrate state of the art performance on the Overcooked benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in generalizing to diverse human behaviors.
