- **[DRIVE: Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation for Constraint-Aware Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04066)**  `arXiv:2508.04066`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work, we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts. These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification. We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD, highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves 0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for real-world deployment.

- **[Open Scene Graphs for Open-World Object-Goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04678)**  `arXiv:2508.04678`  `cs.RO`  
  _Joel Loo, Zhanxin Wu, David Hsu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How can we build general-purpose robot systems for open-world semantic navigation, e.g., searching a novel environment for a target object specified in natural language? To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment, e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot over diverse goals, environments, and robot embodiments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient motion planning remains a key challenge in industrial robotics, especially for multi-axis systems operating in complex environments. This paper addresses that challenge by integrating GPU-accelerated motion planning through NVIDIA's cuRobo library into Vention's modular automation platform. By leveraging accurate CAD-based digital twins and real-time parallel optimization, our system enables rapid trajectory generation and dynamic collision avoidance for pick-and-place tasks. We demonstrate this capability on robots equipped with additional degrees of freedom, including a 7th-axis gantry, and benchmark performance across various scenarios. The results show significant improvements in planning speed and robustness, highlighting the potential of GPU-based planning pipelines for scalable, adaptable deployment in modern industrial workflows.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available atthis https URL.

- **[\textit{RoboTron-Nav}: A Unified Framework for Embodied Navigation Integrating Perception, Planning, and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18525)**  `arXiv:2503.18525`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In language-guided visual navigation, agents locate target objects in unseen environments using natural language instructions. For reliable navigation in unfamiliar scenes, agents should possess strong perception, planning, and prediction capabilities. Additionally, when agents revisit previously explored areas during long-term navigation, they may retain irrelevant and redundant historical perceptions, leading to suboptimal results. In this work, we propose \textbf{RoboTron-Nav}, a unified framework that integrates {p}erception, {p}lanning, and {p}rediction capabilities through multitask collaborations on navigation and embodied question answering tasks, thereby enhancing navigation performances. Furthermore, RoboTron-Nav employs an adaptive 3D-aware history sampling strategy to effectively and efficiently utilize historical observations. By leveraging large language model, RoboTron-Nav comprehends diverse commands and complex visual scenes, resulting in appropriate navigation actions. RoboTron-Nav achieves an 81.1\% success rate in object goal navigation on the $\mathrm{CHORES}$-$\mathbb{S}$ benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

- **[COPO: Consistency-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04138)**  `arXiv:2508.04138`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability.

- **[GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772)**  `arXiv:2508.03772`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

- **[PRISM: Lightweight Multivariate Time-Series Classification through Symmetric Multi-Resolution Convolutional Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04503)**  `arXiv:2508.04503`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Federico Zucchi, Thomas Lampert_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

- **[Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04280)**  `arXiv:2508.04280`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

- **[A Comparative Survey of PyTorch vs TensorFlow for Deep Learning: Usability, Performance, and Deployment Trade-offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04035)**  `arXiv:2508.04035`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zakariya Ba Alawi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability, performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem (TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support, including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g., PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution, improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem - understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative analysis

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.

- **[Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding with Large Language Models for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02762)**  `arXiv:2508.02762`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Dahun Kim, Anelia Angelova_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We leverage a pretrained LLM as the text encoder within the CLIP framework, processing all prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

- **[DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753)**  `arXiv:2508.02753`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Haonan Yang, Jianchao Tang, Zhuo Li, Long Lan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks.

- **[From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20968)**  `arXiv:2507.20968`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Rongyao Cai, Ming Jin, Qingsong Wen, Kexin Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that govern domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists of three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 scenarios and ranking first across all benchmarks.

- **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007)**  `arXiv:2503.24007`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.

- **[UltraSTF: Ultra-Compact Model for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634)**  `arXiv:2502.20634`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Xiran Fan, Zhimeng Jiang, Yujie Fan, Huiyuan Chen, Uday Singh Saini, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hospitals struggle to predict critical outcomes. Traditional early warning systems, like NEWS and MEWS, rely on static variables and fixed thresholds, limiting their adaptability, accuracy, and personalization. We previously developed the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), an AI model that tokenizes patient health timelines (PHTs) from EHRs and uses transformer-based architectures to predict future PHTs. ETHOS is a versatile framework for developing a wide range of applications. In this work, we develop the Adaptive Risk Estimation System (ARES) that leverages ETHOS to compute dynamic, personalized risk probabilities for clinician-defined critical events. ARES also features a personalized explainability module that highlights key clinical factors influencing risk estimates. We evaluated ARES using the MIMIC-IV v2.2 dataset together with its Emergency Department (ED) extension and benchmarked performance against both classical early warning systems and contemporary machine learning models. The entire dataset was tokenized resulting in 285,622 PHTs, comprising over 360 million tokens. ETHOS outperformed benchmark models in predicting hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and prolonged stays, achieving superior AUC scores. Its risk estimates were robust across demographic subgroups, with calibration curves confirming model reliability. The explainability module provided valuable insights into patient-specific risk factors. ARES, powered by ETHOS, advances predictive healthcare AI by delivering dynamic, real-time, personalized risk estimation with patient-specific explainability. Although our results are promising, the clinical impact remains uncertain. Demonstrating ARES's true utility in real-world settings will be the focus of our future work. We release the source code to facilitate future research.

  _Krzysztof Olejniczak, Xingyue Huang, Mikhail Galkin, ƒ∞smail ƒ∞lkan Ceylan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.

- **[FedHiP: Heterogeneity-Invariant Personalized Federated Learning Through Closed-Form Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04470)**  `arXiv:2508.04470`  `cs.LG`  
  _Jianheng Tang, Zhirui Yang, Jingchao Wang, Kejia Fan, Jinfeng Xu, Huiping Zhuang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor, we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97% in accuracy.

- **[GFocal: A Global-Focal Neural Operator for Solving PDEs on Arbitrary Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04463)**  `arXiv:2508.04463`  `cs.LG`  
  _Fangzhi Fei, Jiaxin Hu, Qiaofeng Li, Zhenyu Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations, profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations and local features are harnessed through Nystr√∂m attention-based \textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\% relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

- **[Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04329)**  `arXiv:2508.04329`  `cs.LG`  
  _Ali Taheri Ghahrizjani, Alireza Taban, Qizhou Wang, Shanshan Ye, Abdolreza Mirzaei, Tongliang Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses.

  _Abdul Monaf Chowdhury, Rabeya Akter, Safaeid Hossain Arib_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches, where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98% on average.

  The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes (SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits, inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

  Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore, experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

  Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

  Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12 probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However, enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL. Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2) \textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions, including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are available at:this https URL.

  Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples, we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

  As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components, revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling (LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\% of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\% lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

  Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

  Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA atthis https URL.

  With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance.

  Recently, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements. When dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs typically divide them into multiple local images and a global image, leading to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. Specifically, we first apply the multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens at different granularities. Then we propose a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we put forward RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

  The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

  Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state. While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically, we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings, significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

  Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

  Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical image analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

  Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

  Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system over benchmark methods.

  This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024 benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains, demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

  Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing $196,262$ image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from 0.74 to 0.87.

  Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

  Existing pedestrian attribute recognition methods are generally developed based on RGB frame cameras. However, these approaches are constrained by the limitations of RGB cameras, such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and motion blur, which hinder their performance. Furthermore, current attribute recognition primarily focuses on analyzing pedestrians' external appearance and clothing, lacking an exploration of emotional dimensions. In this paper, we revisit these issues and propose a novel multi-modal RGB-Event attribute recognition task by drawing inspiration from the advantages of event cameras in low-light, high-speed, and low-power consumption. Specifically, we introduce the first large-scale multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition dataset, termed EventPAR, comprising 100K paired RGB-Event samples that cover 50 attributes related to both appearance and six human emotions, diverse scenes, and various seasons. By retraining and evaluating mainstream PAR models on this dataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and provide a solid foundation for future research in terms of data and algorithmic baselines. In addition, we propose a novel RWKV-based multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition framework, featuring an RWKV visual encoder and an asymmetric RWKV fusion module. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed dataset as well as two simulated datasets (MARS-Attribute and DukeMTMC-VID-Attribute), achieving state-of-the-art results.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Wide-angle cameras, despite their popularity for content creation, suffer from distortion-induced facial stretching-especially at the edge of the lens-which degrades visual appeal. To address this issue, we propose a structure-to-detail portrait correction model named ImagePC. It integrates the long-range awareness of the transformer and multi-step denoising of diffusion models into a unified framework, achieving global structural robustness and local detail refinement. Besides, considering the high cost of obtaining video labels, we then repurpose ImagePC for unlabeled wide-angle videos (termed VideoPC), by spatiotemporal diffusion adaption with spatial consistency and temporal smoothness constraints. For the former, we encourage the denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle distortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification trajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them. Compared with ImagePC, VideoPC maintains high-quality facial corrections in space and mitigates the potential temporal shakes sequentially in blind scenarios. Finally, to establish an evaluation benchmark and train the framework, we establish a video portrait dataset with a large diversity in the number of people, lighting conditions, and background. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing solutions quantitatively and qualitatively, contributing to high-fidelity wide-angle videos with stable and natural portraits.

  With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

  Human-centric perception tasks, e.g., pedestrian detection, skeleton-based action recognition, and pose estimation, have wide industrial applications, such as metaverse and sports analysis. There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, \emph{e.g.,} languages, and the other for continuous representations, \emph{e.g.,} location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 11 benchmarks. The code will be available onthis https URL.

  Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI agents in the physical world.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead. However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally, ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel categories.

  Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and 2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices.

  Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

  Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification, systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB, CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models (ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems for dermatology.

  This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding (capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types. Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography, presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad dMRI applications.

  Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this, explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately, enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16 videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation. Our project page isthis https URL

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task, \underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion (CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively.

  The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.

  Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

  The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs.

  Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image benchmarks.

  Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role, leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically, we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short, middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG task.

  Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes, remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

  Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.

  The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect, potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment. An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset, leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement. This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising field.

  Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty, our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement, effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network (LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then, during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints. These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across various scenes.

  Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance, their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final results.this https URLfor more information.

  This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation. We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically, we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for instance segmentation tasks.

  Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc. To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical. In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

  In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture, often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder (TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

  Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find, cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias, a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper publication.

  Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues, explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

  Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6 well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic, multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and generalizable VTR systems.

  Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model complexity and computational overhead.

  Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open classes.

  Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with 8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and 4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Notably, we provide an extensive comparison of AVS methods across standard benchmarks, highlighting the impact of different architectural choices, fusion strategies, and training paradigms on performance. Finally, we outline the current challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision, lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more intelligent AVS systems.

  Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.

  The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

  Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

  Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

  Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation. The dataset and evaluation codes will be available atthis https URL.

  Performance comparisons are fundamental in medical imaging Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, often driving claims of superiority based on relative improvements in common performance metrics. However, such claims frequently rely solely on empirical mean performance. In this paper, we investigate whether newly proposed methods genuinely outperform the state of the art by analyzing a representative cohort of medical imaging papers. We quantify the probability of false claims based on a Bayesian approach that leverages reported results alongside empirically estimated model congruence to estimate whether the relative ranking of methods is likely to have occurred by chance. According to our results, the majority (>80%) of papers claims outperformance when introducing a new method. Our analysis further revealed a high probability (>5%) of false outperformance claims in 86% of classification papers and 53% of segmentation papers. These findings highlight a critical flaw in current benchmarking practices: claims of outperformance in medical imaging AI are frequently unsubstantiated, posing a risk of misdirecting future research efforts.

  The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remainsthis http URLthis work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM≈õ language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (\eg SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. These components form CreatiLayout -- a systematic solution that integrates the layout model, dataset, and planner for creative layout-to-image generation.

  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies offer a promising paradigm to mitigate the limitations of constrained observability in single-vehicle systems. Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

  With the rapid development of generative technologies, AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) have been widely applied in various aspects of daily life. However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.

  Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding (OV-3D) aims to localize and classify novel objects beyond the closed set of object classes. However, existing approaches and benchmarks primarily focus on the open vocabulary problem within the context of object classes, which is insufficient in providing a holistic evaluation to what extent a model understands the 3D scene. In this paper, we introduce a more challenging task called Generalized Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding (GOV-3D) to explore the open vocabulary problem beyond object classes. It encompasses an open and diverse set of generalized knowledge, expressed as linguistic queries of fine-grained and object-specific attributes. To this end, we contribute a new benchmark named \textit{OpenScan}, which consists of 3D object attributes across eight representative linguistic aspects, including affordance, property, and material. We further evaluate state-of-the-art OV-3D methods on our OpenScan benchmark and discover that these methods struggle to comprehend the abstract vocabularies of the GOV-3D task, a challenge that cannot be addressed simply by scaling up object classes during training. We highlight the limitations of existing methodologies and explore promising directions to overcome the identified shortcomings.

  Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

  Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR), with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

  Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

  Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.

  Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios, lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance across all tasks.

Building upon our foundational work on the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications, enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment, facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

  Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English. Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics - available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations, this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings. GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a "Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

  Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

  Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are revolutionizing human-computer interaction, yet their reliance on text-based instructions imposes limitations on accessibility and convenience, particularly in hands-free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose replacing text with speech as the instruction input modality for GUI agents, and introduce UITron-Speech, which is the first end-to-end GUI agent capable of directly processing speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict user actions. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, we synthesize high-quality speech instruction datasets using a random-speaker text-to-speech model. Additionally, we design a mixed-modality training strategy to mitigate the inherent modality imbalance in pre-trained foundation models. Furthermore, we conduct a statistical analysis of the distribution of GUI grounding prediction errors and propose a training-free two-step grounding refinement method to alleviate minor localization deviations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UITron-Speech achieves robust performance and superior adaptability, underscoring the feasibility and potential of speech-driven GUI agents for more accessible and intelligent human-computer interaction.

  Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

  As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

  LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets -- DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best overall performance.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for future research.

  Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

  Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e., broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g., datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events (e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1 score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources, branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding capabilities.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model (GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step, evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This "answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.

  Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

  Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks. While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition, they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

  Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\% in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases, resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL research in RLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization, leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of 43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character, suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs. We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

  Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full spectrum of real world medical tasks.To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

  As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines, while also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans, irrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks.

  In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain. We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task. Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph. By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning. The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance. However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning. This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains. Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics.

  Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.

  Recent LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning during generation. However, the internal mechanisms behind these reasoning processes remain unexplored. We observe reasoning LLMs consistently use vocabulary associated with human reasoning processes. We hypothesize these words correspond to specific reasoning moments within the models' internal mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. We introduce ReasonScore, an automatic metric to identify active SAE features during these reasoning moments. We perform manual and automatic interpretation of the features detected by our metric, and find those with activation patterns matching uncertainty, exploratory thinking, and reflection. Through steering experiments, we demonstrate that amplifying these features increases performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks (+2.2%) while producing longer reasoning traces (+20.5%). Using the model diffing technique, we provide evidence that these features are present only in models with reasoning capabilities. Our work provides the first step towards a mechanistic understanding of reasoning in LLMs. Code available atthis https URL

  As researchers continue to optimize AI agents for more effective task execution within operating systems, they often overlook a critical security concern: the ability of these agents to detect "impostors" within their environment. Through an analysis of the agents' operational context, we identify a significant threat-attackers can disguise malicious attacks as environmental elements, injecting active disturbances into the agents' execution processes to manipulate their decision-making. We define this novel threat as the Active Environment Injection Attack (AEIA). Focusing on the interaction mechanisms of the Android OS, we conduct a risk assessment of AEIA and identify two critical security vulnerabilities: (1) Adversarial content injection in multimodal interaction interfaces, where attackers embed adversarial instructions within environmental elements to mislead agent decision-making; and (2) Reasoning gap vulnerabilities in the agent's task execution process, which increase susceptibility to AEIA attacks during reasoning. To evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities, we propose AEIA-MN, an attack scheme that exploits interaction vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems to assess the robustness of MLLM-based agents. Experimental results show that even advanced MLLMs are highly vulnerable to this attack, achieving a maximum attack success rate of 93% on the AndroidWorld benchmark by combining two vulnerabilities.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent effort on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

  The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

  Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that, despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However, existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect: whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable. To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics: Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support future research.

  Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

  _Rui Ha, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Pu, Sen Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments". However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

  While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive "less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion.

  _Anran Xu, Jincheng Wang, Baigen Cai, Tao Wen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

  Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions:1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.

  Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

  In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

  Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users. The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive, privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation. Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

  Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available atthis https URL.
