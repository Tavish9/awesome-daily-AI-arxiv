- **[Towards Benchmarking and Assessing the Safety and Robustness of Autonomous Driving on Safety-critical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23708)**  `arXiv:2503.23708`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous driving has made significant progress in both academia and industry, including performance improvements in perception task and the development of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the safety and robustness assessment of autonomous driving has not received sufficient attention. Current evaluations of autonomous driving are typically conducted in natural driving scenarios. However, many accidents often occur in edge cases, also known as safety-critical scenarios. These safety-critical scenarios are difficult to collect, and there is currently no clear definition of what constitutes a safety-critical scenario. In this work, we explore the safety and robustness of autonomous driving in safety-critical scenarios. First, we provide a definition of safety-critical scenarios, including static traffic scenarios such as adversarial attack scenarios and natural distribution shifts, as well as dynamic traffic scenarios such as accident scenarios. Then, we develop an autonomous driving safety testing platform to comprehensively evaluate autonomous driving systems, encompassing not only the assessment of perception modules but also system-level evaluations. Our work systematically constructs a safety verification process for autonomous driving, providing technical support for the industry to establish standardized test framework and reduce risks in real-world road deployment.

  Accurate and stable feature matching is critical for computer vision tasks, particularly in applications such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). While recent learning-based feature matching methods have demonstrated promising performance in challenging spatiotemporal scenarios, they still face inherent trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency in specific settings. In this paper, we propose a lightweight feature matching network designed to establish sparse, stable, and consistent correspondence between multiple frames. The proposed method eliminates the dependency on manual annotations during training and mitigates feature drift through a hybrid self-supervised paradigm. Extensive experiments validate three key advantages: (1) Our method operates without dependency on external prior knowledge and seamlessly incorporates its hybrid training mechanism into original datasets. (2) Benchmarked against state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods, our approach maintains equivalent computational efficiency at low-resolution scales while achieving a 2-10x improvement in computational efficiency for high-resolution inputs. (3) Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed hybrid self-supervised scheme effectively mitigates feature drift in long-term tracking while maintaining consistent representation across image sequences.

  Translating high-level linguistic instructions into precise robotic actions in the physical world remains challenging, particularly when considering the feasibility of interacting with 3D objects. In this paper, we introduce 3D-TAFS, a novel training-free multimodal framework for 3D affordance segmentation. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of such frameworks, we present IndoorAfford-Bench, a large-scale benchmark containing 9,248 images spanning 20 diverse indoor scenes across 6 areas, supporting standardized interaction queries. In particular, our framework integrates a large multimodal model with a specialized 3D vision network, enabling a seamless fusion of 2D and 3D visual understanding with language comprehension. Extensive experiments on IndoorAfford-Bench validate the proposed 3D-TAFS's capability in handling interactive 3D affordance segmentation tasks across diverse settings, showcasing competitive performance across various metrics. Our results highlight 3D-TAFS's potential for enhancing human-robot interaction based on affordance understanding in complex indoor environments, advancing the development of more intuitive and efficient robotic frameworks for real-world applications.

- **[LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are Important](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04704)**  `arXiv:2504.04704`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Manlai Liang, JiaMing Zhang, Xiong Li, Jinlong Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modifiation of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Base on the fact that the Large Lanuage models are autoregresssive models, we propose {\it LagKV}, a KV allocation strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themself. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on LongBench and PasskeyRetrieval show that, our approach achieves nearly zero loss when the ratio is $2\times$ and $\approx 90\%$ of the original model performance for $8\times$. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our mehod outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $60\%$ with same compression ratios.

- **[TDBench: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models in Understanding Top-Down Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03748)**  `arXiv:2504.03748`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Kaiyuan Hou, Minghui Zhao, Lilin Xu, Yuang Fan, Xiaofan Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, enabling applications in scene comprehension and visual reasoning. While these models have been primarily evaluated and developed for front-view image understanding, their capabilities in interpreting top-down images have received limited attention, partly due to the scarcity of diverse top-down datasets and the challenges in collecting such data. In contrast, top-down vision provides explicit spatial overviews and improved contextual understanding of scenes, making it particularly valuable for tasks like autonomous navigation, aerial imaging, and spatial planning. In this work, we address this gap by introducing TDBench, a comprehensive benchmark for VLMs in top-down image understanding. TDBench is constructed from public top-down view datasets and high-quality simulated images, including diverse real-world and synthetic scenarios. TDBench consists of visual question-answer pairs across ten evaluation dimensions of image understanding. Moreover, we conduct four case studies that commonly happen in real-world scenarios but are less explored. By revealing the strengths and limitations of existing VLM through evaluation results, we hope TDBench to provide insights for motivating future research. Project homepage:this https URL

- **[Timeseries Foundation Models for Mobility: A Benchmark Comparison with Traditional and Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03725)**  `arXiv:2504.03725`  `cs.LG`  
  _Anita Graser_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crowd and flow predictions have been extensively studied in mobility data science. Traditional forecasting methods have relied on statistical models such as ARIMA, later supplemented by deep learning approaches like ST-ResNet. More recently, foundation models for time series forecasting, such as TimeGPT, Chronos, and LagLlama, have emerged. A key advantage of these models is their ability to generate zero-shot predictions, allowing them to be applied directly to new tasks without retraining. This study evaluates the performance of TimeGPT compared to traditional approaches for predicting city-wide mobility timeseries using two bike-sharing datasets from New York City and Vienna, Austria. Model performance is assessed across short (1-hour), medium (12-hour), and long-term (24-hour) forecasting horizons. The results highlight the potential of foundation models for mobility forecasting while also identifying limitations of our experiments.

- **[UnCLe: Benchmarking Continual Learning for Unsupervised Depth Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18074)**  `arXiv:2410.18074`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Suchisrit Gangopadhyay, Xien Chen, Michael Chu, Patrick Rim, Hyoungseob Park, Alex Wong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose UnCLe, a standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal depth estimation task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. Existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel non-stationary distributions, they "catastrophically forget" previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models for indoor and outdoor and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we introduce model inversion quality as an additional measure of forgetting. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.

- **[Can You Count to Nine? A Human Evaluation Benchmark for Counting Limits in Modern Text-to-Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04051)**  `arXiv:2504.04051`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models have driven significant progress in a variety of AI tasks, including text-to-video generation, where models like Video LDM and Stable Video Diffusion can produce realistic, movie-level videos from textual instructions. Despite these advances, current text-to-video models still face fundamental challenges in reliably following human commands, particularly in adhering to simple numerical constraints. In this work, we present T2VCountBench, a specialized benchmark aiming at evaluating the counting capability of SOTA text-to-video models as of 2025. Our benchmark employs rigorous human evaluations to measure the number of generated objects and covers a diverse range of generators, covering both open-source and commercial models. Extensive experiments reveal that all existing models struggle with basic numerical tasks, almost always failing to generate videos with an object count of 9 or fewer. Furthermore, our comprehensive ablation studies explore how factors like video style, temporal dynamics, and multilingual inputs may influence counting performance. We also explore prompt refinement techniques and demonstrate that decomposing the task into smaller subtasks does not easily alleviate these limitations. Our findings highlight important challenges in current text-to-video generation and provide insights for future research aimed at improving adherence to basic numerical constraints.

- **[Video-Bench: Human-Aligned Video Generation Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04907)**  `arXiv:2504.04907`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment.

- **[NuScenes-SpatialQA: A Spatial Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark for Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03164)**  `arXiv:2504.03164`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for autonomous driving tasks. However, their spatial understanding and reasoning-key capabilities for autonomous driving-still exhibit significant limitations. Notably, none of the existing benchmarks systematically evaluate VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose NuScenes-SpatialQA, the first large-scale ground-truth-based Question-Answer (QA) benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of VLMs in autonomous driving. Built upon the NuScenes dataset, the benchmark is constructed through an automated 3D scene graph generation pipeline and a QA generation pipeline. The benchmark systematically evaluates VLMs' performance in both spatial understanding and reasoning across multiple dimensions. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse VLMs, including both general and spatial-enhanced models, providing the first comprehensive evaluation of their spatial capabilities in autonomous driving. Surprisingly, the experimental results show that the spatial-enhanced VLM outperforms in qualitative QA but does not demonstrate competitiveness in quantitative QA. In general, VLMs still face considerable challenges in spatial understanding and reasoning.

- **[InstructionBench: An Instructional Video Understanding Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05040)**  `arXiv:2504.05040`  `cs.CV`  
  _Haiwan Wei, Yitian Yuan, Xiaohan Lan, Wei Ke, Lin Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite progress in video large language models (Video-LLMs), research on instructional video understanding, crucial for enhancing access to instructional content, remains insufficient. To address this, we introduce InstructionBench, an Instructional video understanding Benchmark, which challenges models' advanced temporal reasoning within instructional videos characterized by their strict step-by-step flow. Employing GPT-4, we formulate Q\&A pairs in open-ended and multiple-choice formats to assess both Coarse-Grained event-level and Fine-Grained object-level reasoning. Our filtering strategies exclude questions answerable purely by common-sense knowledge, focusing on visual perception and analysis when evaluating Video-LLM models. The benchmark finally contains 5k questions across over 700 videos. We evaluate the latest Video-LLMs on our InstructionBench, finding that closed-source models outperform open-source ones. However, even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 53.42\% accuracy, indicating significant gaps in temporal reasoning. To advance the field, we also develop a comprehensive instructional video dataset with over 19k Q\&A pairs from nearly 2.5k videos, using an automated data generation framework, thereby enriching the community's research resources.

  _Yunlong Lin, Zixu Lin, Haoyu Chen, Panwang Pan, Chenxin Li, Sixiang Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-centric perception systems struggle with unpredictable and coupled weather degradations in the wild. Current solutions are often limited, as they either depend on specific degradation priors or suffer from significant domain gaps. To enable robust and autonomous operation in real-world conditions, we propose JarvisIR, a VLM-powered agent that leverages the VLM as a controller to manage multiple expert restoration models. To further enhance system robustness, reduce hallucinations, and improve generalizability in real-world adverse weather, JarvisIR employs a novel two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning and human feedback alignment. Specifically, to address the lack of paired data in real-world scenarios, the human feedback alignment enables the VLM to be fine-tuned effectively on large-scale real-world data in an unsupervised manner. To support the training and evaluation of JarvisIR, we introduce CleanBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of high-quality and large-scale instruction-responses pairs, including 150K synthetic entries and 80K real entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JarvisIR exhibits superior decision-making and restoration capabilities. Compared with existing methods, it achieves a 50% improvement in the average of all perception metrics on CleanBench-Real. Project page:this https URL.

  Existing MLLM benchmarks face significant challenges in evaluating Unified MLLMs (U-MLLMs) due to: 1) lack of standardized benchmarks for traditional tasks, leading to inconsistent comparisons; 2) absence of benchmarks for mixed-modality generation, which fails to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess U-MLLMs. Our benchmark includes: Standardized Traditional Task Evaluation. We sample from 12 datasets, covering 10 tasks with 30 subtasks, ensuring consistent and fair comparisons across studies." 2. Unified Task Assessment. We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking. We evaluate 12 leading U-MLLMs, such as Janus-Pro, EMU3, VILA-U, and Gemini2-flash, alongside specialized understanding (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and generation models (e.g., DALL-E-3). Our findings reveal substantial performance gaps in existing U-MLLMs, highlighting the need for more robust models capable of handling mixed-modality tasks effectively.

- **[Benchmarking Multi-modal Semantic Segmentation under Sensor Failures: Missing and Noisy Modality Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18445)**  `arXiv:2503.18445`  `cs.CV`  
  _Chenfei Liao, Kaiyu Lei, Xu Zheng, Junha Moon, Zhixiong Wang, Yixuan Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) addresses the limitations of single-modality data by integrating complementary information across modalities. Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field. Source code is available atthis https URL.

- **[MultiEYE: Dataset and Benchmark for OCT-Enhanced Retinal Disease Recognition from Fundus Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09402)**  `arXiv:2412.09402`  `cs.CV`  
  _Lehan Wang, Chongchong Qi, Chubin Ou, Lin An, Mei Jin, Xiangbin Kong, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing multi-modal learning methods on fundus and OCT images mostly require both modalities to be available and strictly paired for training and testing, which appears less practical in clinical scenarios. To expand the scope of clinical applications, we formulate a novel setting, "OCT-enhanced disease recognition from fundus images", that allows for the use of unpaired multi-modal data during the training phase and relies on the widespread fundus photographs for testing. To benchmark this setting, we present the first large multi-modal multi-class dataset for eye disease diagnosis, MultiEYE, and propose an OCT-assisted Conceptual Distillation Approach (OCT-CoDA), which employs semantically rich concepts to extract disease-related knowledge from OCT images and leverage them into the fundus model. Specifically, we regard the image-concept relation as a link to distill useful knowledge from the OCT teacher model to the fundus student model, which considerably improves the diagnostic performance based on fundus images and formulates the cross-modal knowledge transfer into an explainable process. Through extensive experiments on the multi-disease classification task, our proposed OCT-CoDA demonstrates remarkable results and interpretability, showing great potential for clinical application. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

- **[EE-MLLM: A Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11795)**  `arXiv:2408.11795`  `cs.CV`  
  _Feipeng Ma, Yizhou Zhou, Zheyu Zhang, Shilin Yan, Hebei Li, Zilong He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated satisfactory performance across various vision-language tasks. Current approaches for vision and language interaction fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. However, both approaches present inherent limitations, forcing a trade-off between data and computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Data-$\textbf{E}$fficient and Compute-$\textbf{E}$fficient $\textbf{MLLM}$ ($\textbf{EE-MLLM}$). Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention among visual tokens to achieve $\textbf{compute efficiency}$, and 2) reusing the weights from each layer of LLM to facilitate effective vision-language modality alignment for $\textbf{data efficiency}$. As a result, EE-MLLM significantly outperforms Flamingo with limited training data, and reduces the prefilling time to 79 ms on an H800 GPU, compared to LLaVA's 277 ms. To further investigate the efficiency of EE-MLLM, we present a training-free variant named EE-MLLM-F, which reduces the computation cost of self-attention-based method without additional training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.

  Prompt Recovery, reconstructing prompts from the outputs of large language models (LLMs), has grown in importance as LLMs become ubiquitous. Most users access LLMs through APIs without internal model weights, relying only on outputs and logits, which complicates recovery. This paper explores a unique prompt recovery task focused on reconstructing prompts for style transfer and rephrasing, rather than typical question-answering. We introduce a dataset created with LLM assistance, ensuring quality through multiple techniques, and test methods like zero-shot, few-shot, jailbreak, chain-of-thought, fine-tuning, and a novel canonical-prompt fallback for poor-performing cases. Our results show that one-shot and fine-tuning yield the best outcomes but highlight flaws in traditional sentence similarity metrics for evaluating prompt recovery. Contributions include (1) a benchmark dataset, (2) comprehensive experiments on prompt recovery strategies, and (3) identification of limitations in current evaluation metrics, all of which advance general prompt recovery research, where the structure of the input prompt is unrestricted.

  _Ruikang Liu, Yuxuan Sun, Manyi Zhang, Haoli Bai, Xianzhi Yu, Tiezheng Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex tasks, but their extended chain-of-thought reasoning process increases inference overhead. While quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the inference cost of large language models, its impact on reasoning models remains understudied. In this study, we conduct the first systematic study on quantized reasoning models, evaluating the open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen and LLaMA families ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters, and QwQ-32B. Our investigation covers weight, KV cache, and activation quantization using state-of-the-art algorithms at varying bit-widths, with extensive evaluation across mathematical (AIME, MATH-500), scientific (GPQA), and programming (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while lossless quantization can be achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization, lower bit-widths introduce significant accuracy risks. We further identify model size, model origin, and task difficulty as critical determinants of performance. Contrary to expectations, quantized models do not exhibit increased output lengths. In addition, strategically scaling the model sizes or reasoning steps can effectively enhance the performance. All quantized models and codes will be open-sourced inthis https URL.

  _Weiwei Sun, Shengyu Feng, Shanda Li, Yiming Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although LLM-based agents have attracted significant attention in domains such as software engineering and machine learning research, their role in advancing combinatorial optimization (CO) remains relatively underexplored. This gap underscores the need for a deeper understanding of their potential in tackling structured, constraint-intensive problems-a pursuit currently limited by the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for systematic investigation. To address this, we introduce CO-Bench, a benchmark suite featuring 36 real-world CO problems drawn from a broad range of domains and complexity levels. CO-Bench includes structured problem formulations and curated data to support rigorous investigation of LLM agents. We evaluate multiple agent frameworks against established human-designed algorithms, revealing key strengths and limitations of current approaches and identifying promising directions for future research. CO-Bench is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on standard benchmarks, yet they struggle increasingly from mode collapse, the inability to generate diverse and novel outputs. Our work introduces NoveltyBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of language models to produce multiple distinct and high-quality outputs. NoveltyBench utilizes prompts curated to elicit diverse answers and filtered real-world user queries. Evaluating 20 leading language models, we find that current state-of-the-art systems generate significantly less diversity than human writers. Notably, larger models within a family often exhibit less diversity than their smaller counterparts, challenging the notion that capability on standard benchmarks translates directly to generative utility. While prompting strategies like in-context regeneration can elicit diversity, our findings highlight a fundamental lack of distributional diversity in current models, reducing their utility for users seeking varied responses and suggesting the need for new training and evaluation paradigms that prioritize creativity alongside quality.

- **[A Benchmark for End-to-End Zero-Shot Biomedical Relation Extraction with LLMs: Experiments with OpenAI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04083)**  `arXiv:2504.04083`  `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective: Zero-shot methodology promises to cut down on costs of dataset annotation and domain expertise needed to make use of NLP. Generative large language models trained to align with human goals have achieved high zero-shot performance across a wide variety of tasks. As of yet, it is unclear how well these models perform on biomedical relation extraction (RE). To address this knowledge gap, we explore patterns in the performance of OpenAI LLMs across a diverse sampling of RE tasks.Methods: We use OpenAI GPT-4-turbo and their reasoning model o1 to conduct end-to-end RE experiments on seven datasets. We use the JSON generation capabilities of GPT models to generate structured output in two ways: (1) by defining an explicit schema describing the structure of relations, and (2) using a setting that infers the structure from the prompt language.Results: Our work is the first to study and compare the performance of the GPT-4 and o1 for the end-to-end zero-shot biomedical RE task across a broad array of datasets. We found the zero-shot performances to be proximal to that of fine-tuned methods. The limitations of this approach are that it performs poorly on instances containing many relations and errs on the boundaries of textual mentions.Conclusion: Recent large language models exhibit promising zero-shot capabilities in complex biomedical RE tasks, offering competitive performance with reduced dataset curation and NLP modeling needs at the cost of increased computing, potentially increasing medical community accessibility. Addressing the limitations we identify could further boost reliability. The code, data, and prompts for all our experiments are publicly available:this https URL

  With the rapid advancement of mathematical reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), AI systems are increasingly being adopted in educational settings to support students' comprehension of problem-solving processes. However, a critical component remains underexplored in current LLM-generated explanations: visual explanation. In real-world instructional contexts, human tutors routinely employ visual aids - such as diagrams, markings, and highlights - to enhance conceptual clarity. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of visual solution explanation, which requires generating explanations that incorporate newly introduced visual elements essential for understanding (e.g., auxiliary lines, annotations, or geometric constructions). To evaluate model performance on this task, we propose MathExplain, a multimodal benchmark consisting of 997 math problems annotated with visual keypoints and corresponding explanatory text that references those elements. Our empirical results show that while some closed-source models demonstrate promising capabilities on visual solution-explaining, current open-source general-purpose models perform inconsistently, particularly in identifying relevant visual components and producing coherent keypoint-based explanations. We expect that visual solution-explaining and the MathExplain dataset will catalyze further research on multimodal LLMs in education and advance their deployment as effective, explanation-oriented AI tutors. Code and data will be released publicly.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that it is promising to utilize Process Reward Models (PRMs) as verifiers to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, current PRMs face three key challenges: (1) limited process supervision and generalization capabilities, (2) dependence on scalar value prediction without leveraging the generative abilities of LLMs, and (3) inability to scale the test-time compute of PRMs. In this work, we introduce GenPRM, a generative process reward model that performs explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with code verification before providing judgment for each reasoning step. To obtain high-quality process supervision labels and rationale data, we propose Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and a rationale synthesis framework that incorporates code verification. Experimental results on ProcessBench and several mathematical reasoning tasks show that GenPRM significantly outperforms prior PRMs with only 23K training data from MATH dataset. Through test-time scaling, a 1.5B GenPRM outperforms GPT-4o, and a 7B GenPRM surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench. Additionally, GenPRM demonstrates strong abilities to serve as a critic model for policy model refinement. This work establishes a new paradigm for process supervision that bridges the gap between PRMs and critic models in LLMs. Our code, model, and data will be available inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While fact verification remains fundamental, explanation generation serves as a critical enabler for trustworthy fact-checking systems by producing interpretable rationales and facilitating comprehensive verification processes. However, current benchmarks exhibit critical limitations in three dimensions: (1) absence of explanatory annotations, (2) English-centric language bias, and (3) inadequate temporal relevance. To bridge these gaps, we present TrendFact, the first Chinese fact-checking benchmark incorporating structured natural language explanations. TrendFact comprises 7,643 carefully curated samples from trending social media content and professional fact-checking repositories, covering domains such as public health, political discourse, and economic claims. It supports various forms of reasoning, including numerical computation, logical reasoning, and common sense verification. The rigorous multistage construction process ensures high data quality and provides significant challenges. Furthermore, we propose the ECS to complement existing evaluation metrics. To establish effective baselines for TrendFact, we propose FactISR, a dual-component method integrating evidence triangulation and iterative self-reflection mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that current leading reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1) have significant limitations on TrendFact, underscoring the real-world challenges it presents. FactISR significantly enhances reasoning model performance, offering new insights for explainable and complex fact-checking.

  Autonomous agents that execute human tasks by controlling computers can enhance human productivity and application accessibility. However, progress in this field will be driven by realistic and reproducible benchmarks. We present AndroidWorld, a fully functional Android environment that provides reward signals for 116 programmatic tasks across 20 real-world Android apps. Unlike existing interactive environments, which provide a static test set, AndroidWorld dynamically constructs tasks that are parameterized and expressed in natural language in unlimited ways, thus enabling testing on a much larger and more realistic suite of tasks. To ensure reproducibility, each task includes dedicated initialization, success-checking, and tear-down logic, which modifies and inspects the device's system state. We experiment with baseline agents to test AndroidWorld and provide initial results on the benchmark. Our best agent can complete 30.6% of AndroidWorld's tasks, leaving ample room for future work. Furthermore, we adapt a popular desktop web agent to work on Android, which we find to be less effective on mobile, suggesting future research is needed to achieve universal, cross-platform agents. Finally, we also conduct a robustness analysis, showing that task variations can significantly affect agent performance, demonstrating that without such testing, agent performance metrics may not fully reflect practical challenges. AndroidWorld and the experiments in this paper are available atthis http URL.

  LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available atthis https URL.

  We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We open-source our code (this https URL) to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.

  We present VAPO, Value-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization framework for reasoning models., a novel framework tailored for reasoning models within the value-based paradigm. Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of $\mathbf{60.4}$. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.

  As language models continue to grow larger, the cost of acquiring high-quality training data has increased significantly. Collecting human feedback is both expensive and time-consuming, and manual labels can be noisy, leading to an imbalance between helpfulness and harmfulness. Constitutional AI, introduced by Anthropic in December 2022, uses AI to provide feedback to another AI, greatly reducing the need for human labeling. However, the original implementation was designed for a model with around 52 billion parameters, and there is limited information on how well Constitutional AI performs with smaller models, such as LLaMA 3-8B. In this paper, we replicated the Constitutional AI workflow using the smaller LLaMA 3-8B model. Our results show that Constitutional AI can effectively increase the harmlessness of the model, reducing the Attack Success Rate in MT-Bench by 40.8%. However, similar to the original study, increasing harmlessness comes at the cost of helpfulness. The helpfulness metrics, which are an average of the Turn 1 and Turn 2 scores, dropped by 9.8% compared to the baseline. Additionally, we observed clear signs of model collapse in the final DPO-CAI model, indicating that smaller models may struggle with self-improvement due to insufficient output quality, making effective fine-tuning more challenging. Our study suggests that, like reasoning and math ability, self-improvement is an emergent property.

  Despite remarkable progress in machine learning, current AI systems continue to fall short of true human-like intelligence. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI.

  As AI agents surpass human capabilities, scalable oversight -- the problem of effectively supplying human feedback to potentially superhuman AI models -- becomes increasingly critical to ensure alignment. While numerous scalable oversight protocols have been proposed, they lack a systematic empirical framework to evaluate and compare them. While recent works have tried to empirically study scalable oversight protocols -- particularly Debate -- we argue that the experiments they conduct are not generalizable to other protocols. We introduce the scalable oversight benchmark, a principled framework for evaluating human feedback mechanisms based on our agent score difference (ASD) metric, a measure of how effectively a mechanism advantages truth-telling over deception. We supply a Python package to facilitate rapid and competitive evaluation of scalable oversight protocols on our benchmark, and conduct a demonstrative experiment benchmarking Debate.
