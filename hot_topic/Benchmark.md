- **[Train a Multi-Task Diffusion Policy on RLBench-18 in One Day with One GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09430)**  `arXiv:2505.09430`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

  Automated poultry processing lines still rely on humans to lift slippery, easily bruised carcasses onto a shackle conveyor. Deformability, anatomical variance, and strict hygiene rules make conventional suction and scripted motions unreliable. We present ChicGrasp, an end--to--end hardware--software co-design for this task. An independently actuated dual-jaw pneumatic gripper clamps both chicken legs, while a conditional diffusion-policy controller, trained from only 50 multi--view teleoperation demonstrations (RGB + proprioception), plans 5 DoF end--effector motion, which includes jaw commands in one shot. On individually presented raw broiler carcasses, our system achieves a 40.6\% grasp--and--lift success rate and completes the pick to shackle cycle in 38 s, whereas state--of--the--art implicit behaviour cloning (IBC) and LSTM-GMM baselines fail entirely. All CAD, code, and datasets will be open-source. ChicGrasp shows that imitation learning can bridge the gap between rigid hardware and variable bio--products, offering a reproducible benchmark and a public dataset for researchers in agricultural engineering and robot learning.

- **[APR-Transformer: Initial Pose Estimation for Localization in Complex Environments through Absolute Pose Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09356)**  `arXiv:2505.09356`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise initialization plays a critical role in the performance of localization algorithms, especially in the context of robotics, autonomous driving, and computer vision. Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization. Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset. Additionally, we validate the reliability of our approach in GNSS-denied environments by deploying the model in real-time on an autonomous test vehicle. This showcases the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal end-to-end autonomous driving has shown promising advancements in recent work. By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.

- **[SafeNav: Safe Path Navigation using Landmark Based Localization in a GPS-denied Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01956)**  `arXiv:2505.01956`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Ganesh Sapkota, Sanjay Madria_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In battlefield environments, adversaries frequently disrupt GPS signals, requiring alternative localization and navigation methods. Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior computational speed.

- **[Deployable and Generalizable Motion Prediction: Taxonomy, Open Challenges and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09074)**  `arXiv:2505.09074`  `cs.RO`  
  _Letian Wang, Marc-Antoine Lavoie, Sandro Papais, Barza Nisar, Yuxiao Chen, Wenhao Ding, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion prediction, the anticipation of future agent states or scene evolution, is rooted in human cognition, bridging perception and decision-making. It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity.To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

- **[Feature Extractor or Decision Maker: Rethinking the Role of Visual Encoders in Visuomotor Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20248)**  `arXiv:2409.20248`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ruiyu Wang, Zheyu Zhuang, Shutong Jin, Nils Ingelhag, Danica Kragic, Florian T. Pokorny_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An end-to-end (E2E) visuomotor policy is typically treated as a unified whole, but recent approaches using out-of-domain (OOD) data to pretrain the visual encoder have cleanly separated the visual encoder from the network, with the remainder referred to as the policy. We propose Visual Alignment Testing, an experimental framework designed to evaluate the validity of this functional separation. Our results indicate that in E2E-trained models, visual encoders actively contribute to decision-making resulting from motor data supervision, contradicting the assumed functional separation. In contrast, OOD-pretrained models, where encoders lack this capability, experience an average performance drop of 42\% in our benchmark results, compared to the state-of-the-art performance achieved by E2E policies. We believe this initial exploration of visual encoders' role can provide a first step towards guiding future pretraining methods to address their decision-making ability, such as developing task-conditioned or context-aware encoders.

- **[GreenFactory: Ensembling Zero-Cost Proxies to Estimate Performance of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09344)**  `arXiv:2505.09344`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining the performance of a Deep Neural Network during Neural Architecture Search processes is essential for identifying optimal architectures and hyperparameters. Traditionally, this process requires training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training, serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945 for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.

- **[An Extra RMSNorm is All You Need for Fine Tuning to 1.58 Bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08823)**  `arXiv:2505.08823`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural-language processing, yet their scale makes real-world deployment costly. Post-training quantization reduces memory and computation but often degrades accuracy, while quantization-aware training can recover performance at the cost of extra training. Pushing quantization to the ternary (2-bit) regime yields even larger savings but is notoriously unstable. Building on recent work showing that a bias-free, RMS-normalized Transformer with straight-through estimation can reach 1.58-bit precision, we demonstrate that simply inserting RMS normalization before every linear projection and applying a gradual, layer-wise quantization schedule stably fine-tunes full-precision checkpoints into ternary LLMs. Our approach matches or surpasses more elaborate knowledge-distillation pipelines on standard language-modeling benchmarks without adding model complexity. These results indicate that careful normalization alone can close much of the accuracy gap between ternary and full-precision LLMs, making ultra-low-bit inference practical.

- **[Preserving Plasticity in Continual Learning with Adaptive Linearity Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09486)**  `arXiv:2505.09486`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Seyed Roozbeh Razavi Rohani, Khashayar Khajavi, Wesley Chung, Mo Chen, Sharan Vaswani_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.

- **[Rhomboid Tiling for Geometric Graph Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09586)**  `arXiv:2505.09586`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yipeng Zhang, Longlong Li, Kelin Xia_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective for learning from graph-structured data through their neighborhood-based message passing framework. Many hierarchical graph clustering pooling methods modify this framework by introducing clustering-based strategies, enabling the construction of more expressive and powerful models. However, all of these message passing framework heavily rely on the connectivity structure of graphs, limiting their ability to capture the rich geometric features inherent in geometric graphs. To address this, we propose Rhomboid Tiling (RT) clustering, a novel clustering method based on the rhomboid tiling structure, which performs clustering by leveraging the complex geometric information of the data and effectively extracts its higher-order geometric structures. Moreover, we design RTPool, a hierarchical graph clustering pooling model based on RT clustering for graph classification tasks. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, outperforming 21 state-of-the-art competitors on all the 7 benchmark datasets.

- **[Exploiting the Potential Supervision Information of Clean Samples in Partial Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09354)**  `arXiv:2505.09354`  `cs.LG`  
  _Guangtai Wang, Chi-Man Vong, Jintao Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diminishing the impact of false-positive labels is critical for conducting disambiguation in partial label learning. However, the existing disambiguation strategies mainly focus on exploiting the characteristics of individual partial label instances while neglecting the strong supervision information of clean samples randomly lying in the datasets. In this work, we show that clean samples can be collected to offer guidance and enhance the confidence of the most possible candidates. Motivated by the manner of the differentiable count loss strat- egy and the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, we proposed a new calibration strategy called CleanSE. Specifically, we attribute the most reliable candidates with higher significance under the assumption that for each clean sample, if its label is one of the candidates of its nearest neighbor in the representation space, it is more likely to be the ground truth of its neighbor. Moreover, clean samples offer help in characterizing the sample distributions by restricting the label counts of each label to a specific interval. Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic benchmarks and 5 real-world PLL datasets showed this calibration strategy can be applied to most of the state-of-the-art PLL methods as well as enhance their performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing demand for large artificial intelligence model (LAIM) services is driving a paradigm shift from traditional cloud-based inference to edge-based inference for low-latency, privacy-preserving applications. In particular, edge-device co-inference, which partitions LAIMs between edge devices and servers, has emerged as a promising strategy for resource-efficient LAIM execution in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate a pruning-aware LAIM co-inference scheme, where a pre-trained LAIM is pruned and partitioned into on-device and on-server sub-models for deployment. For analysis, we first prove that the LAIM output distortion is upper bounded by its parameter distortion. Then, we derive a lower bound on parameter distortion via rate-distortion theory, analytically capturing the relationship between pruning ratio and co-inference performance. Next, based on the analytical results, we formulate an LAIM co-inference distortion bound minimization problem by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, transmit power, and computation frequency under system latency, energy, and available resource constraints. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to tackle the considered highly non-convex problem. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. In particular, model parameter distortion is shown to provide a reliable bound on output distortion. Also, the proposed joint pruning ratio and resource management design achieves superior performance in balancing trade-offs among inference performance, system latency, and energy consumption compared with benchmark schemes, such as fully on-device and on-server inference. Moreover, the split point is shown to play a critical role in system performance optimization under heterogeneous and resource-limited edge environments.

- **[SpecSphere: Dual-Pass Spectral-Spatial Graph Neural Networks with Certified Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08320)**  `arXiv:2505.08320`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yoonhyuk Choi, Chong-Kwon Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and $\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and (iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist within a single, scalable architecture.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning). Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50% with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately, our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.

- **[Combinatorial Logistic Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17075)**  `arXiv:2410.17075`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel framework called combinatorial logistic bandits (CLogB), where in each round, a subset of base arms (called the super arm) is selected, with the outcome of each base arm being binary and its expectation following a logistic parametric model. The feedback is governed by a general arm triggering process. Our study covers CLogB with reward functions satisfying two smoothness conditions, capturing application scenarios such as online content delivery, online learning to rank, and dynamic channel allocation. We first propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, CLogUCB, utilizing a variance-agnostic exploration bonus. Under the 1-norm triggering probability modulated (TPM) smoothness condition, CLogUCB achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\kappa KT})$, where $\tilde{O}$ ignores logarithmic factors, $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector, $\kappa$ represents the nonlinearity of the logistic model, and $K$ is the maximum number of base arms a super arm can trigger. This result improves on prior work by a factor of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$. We then enhance CLogUCB with a variance-adaptive version, VA-CLogUCB, which attains a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ under the same 1-norm TPM condition, improving another $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ factor. VA-CLogUCB shows even greater promise under the stronger triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) condition, achieving a leading $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret, thus removing the additional dependency on the action-size $K$. Furthermore, we enhance the computational efficiency of VA-CLogUCB by eliminating the nonconvex optimization process when the context feature map is time-invariant while maintaining the tight $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared to benchmark algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs), built on Transformer architectures, exhibit remarkable generalization across a wide range of tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks remains resource-intensive due to their extensive parameterization. In this paper, we explore two remarkable phenomena related to the attention mechanism during the fine-tuning of LLMs (where $\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$ denote the weights of the query, key, and value layers, respectively). The first phenomenon, termed "Unequal Importance of Attention Matrices", highlights the impact of fine-tuning different weight matrices. It shows that optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix yields significantly better performance than optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_k$ matrix. Fine-tuning only the $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrices is computationally efficient while delivering results comparable to, or even better than fine-tuning all three matrices ($\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$). The second phenomenon,"Attention Matrices with Customized Learning Rate Lead to Better Convergence", emphasizes the importance of assigning distinct learning rates to these matrices. Specifically, a higher learning rate for the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix compared to $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_k$ accelerates convergence and improves performance. Building on these insights, we propose a new strategy that improves fine-tuning efficiency in terms of both storage and time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, supporting our theoretical findings. Our analysis lays the theoretical groundwork for configuring and improving algorithms in LLMs fine-tuning.

  Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is widely adopted in modern vehicles, yet its real-world performance remains underexplored due to proprietary systems and limited data access. This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving data from 50+ production vehicle models, collected through extensive road testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from thethis http URLdriving community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i) full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures); ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning; iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current road infrastructure for autonomous driving. The dataset is publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard benchmarks for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo vision algorithms generally focus on model accuracy rather than robustness to image corruptions like noise or rain. Hence, the resilience of models to such real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models. RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur, color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-, stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset, creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type. RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It will be available atthis https URL.

- **[Differentiable Channel Selection in Self-Attention For Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08961)**  `arXiv:2505.08961`  `cs.CV` `cs.LG`  
  _Yancheng Wang, Nebojsa Jojic, Yingzhen Yang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a novel attention module termed the Differentiable Channel Selection Attention module, or the DCS-Attention module. In contrast with conventional self-attention, the DCS-Attention module features selection of informative channels in the computation of the attention weights. The selection of the feature channels is performed in a differentiable manner, enabling seamless integration with DNN training. Our DCS-Attention is compatible with either fixed neural network backbones or learnable backbones with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS), leading to DCS with Fixed Backbone (DCS-FB) and DCS-DNAS, respectively. Importantly, our DCS-Attention is motivated by the principle of Information Bottleneck (IB), and a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss, which can be optimized by SGD, is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the networks with the DCS-Attention modules. In this manner, a neural network with DCS-Attention modules is capable of selecting the most informative channels for feature extraction so that it enjoys state-of-the-art performance for the Re-ID task. Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks using both DCS-FB and DCS-DNAS show that DCS-Attention significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of DNNs for person Re-ID, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DCS-Attention in learning discriminative features critical to identifying person identities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI offers new opportunities for automating urban planning by creating site-specific urban layouts and enabling flexible design exploration. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments. To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images. This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning workflows and public engagement.

  In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model (LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training, we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8% average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients, indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given increasing compute and data.

  Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.

  Scaling up model and data size have demonstrated impressive performance improvement over a wide range of tasks. Despite extensive studies on scaling behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised reconstruction networks using self-attention transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-class (unified) anomaly detection with a single model. However, these self-attention reconstruction models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec, BTAD, and VisA. The code and pre-trained models are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The core challenge in Camouflage Object Detection (COD) lies in the indistinguishable similarity between targets and backgrounds in terms of color, texture, and shape. This causes existing methods to either lose edge details (such as hair-like fine structures) due to over-reliance on global semantic information or be disturbed by similar backgrounds (such as vegetation patterns) when relying solely on local features. We propose DRRNet, a four-stage architecture characterized by a "context-detail-fusion-refinement" pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and enhances the continuity of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that DRRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in high-definition \emph{HD} map construction have demonstrated the effectiveness of dense representations, which heavily rely on computationally intensive bird's-eye view \emph{BEV} features. While sparse representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and ultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline detection. Specifically, SparseMeXt-Tiny reaches a mean average precision \emph{mAP} of 55.5% at 32 frames per second \emph{fps}, while SparseMeXt-Base attains 65.2% mAP. Scaling the backbone and decoder further, SparseMeXt-Large achieves an mAP of 68.9% at over 20 fps, establishing a new benchmark for sparse representations in HD map construction. These results underscore the untapped potential of sparse methods, challenging the conventional reliance on dense representations and redefining efficiency-performance trade-offs in the field.

  Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks.

  Periorbital distances are critical markers for diagnosing and monitoring a range of oculoplastic and craniofacial conditions. Manual measurement, however, is subjective and prone to intergrader variability. Automated methods have been developed but remain limited by standardized imaging requirements, small datasets, and a narrow focus on individual measurements. We developed a segmentation pipeline trained on a domain-specific dataset of healthy eyes and compared its performance against the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the prior benchmark, PeriorbitAI. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated across multiple disease classes and imaging conditions. We further investigated the use of predicted periorbital distances as features for disease classification under in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, comparing shallow classifiers, CNNs, and fusion models. Our segmentation model achieved state-of-the-art accuracy across all datasets, with error rates within intergrader variability and superior performance relative to SAM and PeriorbitAI. In classification tasks, models trained on periorbital distances matched CNN performance on ID data (77--78\% accuracy) and substantially outperformed CNNs under OOD conditions (63--68\% accuracy vs. 14\%). Fusion models achieved the highest ID accuracy (80\%) but were sensitive to degraded CNN features under OOD shifts. Segmentation-derived periorbital distances provide robust, explainable features for disease classification and generalize better under domain shift than CNN image classifiers. These results establish a new benchmark for periorbital distance prediction and highlight the potential of anatomy-based AI pipelines for real-world deployment in oculoplastic and craniofacial care.

  Autonomous vehicles need a complete map of their surroundings to plan and act. This has sparked research into the tasks of 3D occupancy prediction, 3D scene completion, and 3D panoptic scene completion, which predict a dense map of the ego vehicle's surroundings as a voxel grid. Scene completion extends occupancy prediction by predicting occluded regions of the voxel grid, and panoptic scene completion further extends this task by also distinguishing object instances within the same class; both aspects are crucial for path planning and decision-making. However, 3D panoptic scene completion is currently underexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for 3D panoptic scene completion that extends existing 3D semantic scene completion models. We propose an Object Module and Panoptic Module that can easily be integrated with 3D occupancy and scene completion methods presented in the literature. Our approach leverages the available annotations in occupancy benchmarks, allowing individual object shapes to be learned as a differentiable problem. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential for the security of facial recognition systems in diverse scenarios such as payment processing and surveillance. Current multimodal FAS methods often struggle with effective generalization, mainly due to modality-specific biases and domain shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{m}odal \textbf{D}enoising and \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{MMDA}) framework. By leveraging the zero-shot generalization capability of CLIP, the MMDA framework effectively suppresses noise in multimodal data through denoising and alignment mechanisms, thereby significantly enhancing the generalization performance of cross-modal alignment. The \textbf{M}odality-\textbf{D}omain Joint \textbf{D}ifferential \textbf{A}ttention (\textbf{MD2A}) module in MMDA concurrently mitigates the impacts of domain and modality noise by refining the attention mechanism based on extracted common noise features. Furthermore, the \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{S}pace \textbf{S}oft (\textbf{RS2}) Alignment strategy utilizes the pre-trained CLIP model to align multi-domain multimodal data into a generalized representation space in a flexible manner, preserving intricate representations and enhancing the model's adaptability to various unseen conditions. We also design a \textbf{U}-shaped \textbf{D}ual \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{U-DSA}) module to enhance the adaptability of representations while maintaining generalization performance. These improvements not only enhance the framework's generalization capabilities but also boost its ability to represent complex representations. Our experimental results on four benchmark datasets under different evaluation protocols demonstrate that the MMDA framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of cross-domain generalization and multimodal detection accuracy. The code will be released soon.

  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon.

  Text-driven motion generation offers a powerful and intuitive way to create human movements directly from natural language. By removing the need for predefined motion inputs, it provides a flexible and accessible approach to controlling animated characters. This makes it especially useful in areas like virtual reality, gaming, human-computer interaction, and robotics. In this review, we first revisit the traditional perspective on motion synthesis, where models focused on predicting future poses from observed initial sequences, often conditioned on action labels. We then provide a comprehensive and structured survey of modern text-to-motion generation approaches, categorizing them from two complementary perspectives: (i) architectural, dividing methods into VAE-based, diffusion-based, and hybrid models; and (ii) motion representation, distinguishing between discrete and continuous motion generation strategies. In addition, we explore the most widely used datasets, evaluation methods, and recent benchmarks that have shaped progress in this area. With this survey, we aim to capture where the field currently stands, bring attention to its key challenges and limitations, and highlight promising directions for future exploration. We hope this work offers a valuable starting point for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of language-driven human motion synthesis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First, our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities, converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements on complex scene understanding tasks.

  This paper presents G-MSGINet, a unified and efficient framework for robust contactless fingerprint recognition that jointly performs minutiae localization and identity embedding directly from raw input images. Existing approaches rely on multi-branch architectures, orientation labels, or complex preprocessing steps, which limit scalability and generalization across real-world acquisition scenarios. In contrast, the proposed architecture introduces the GMSGI layer, a novel computational module that integrates grouped pixel-level involution, dynamic multi-scale kernel generation, and graph-based relational modelling into a single processing unit. Stacked GMSGI layers progressively refine both local minutiae-sensitive features and global topological representations through end-to-end optimization. The architecture eliminates explicit orientation supervision and adapts graph connectivity directly from learned kernel descriptors, thereby capturing meaningful structural relationships among fingerprint regions without fixed heuristics. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely PolyU, CFPose, and Benchmark 2D/3D, demonstrate that G-MSGINet consistently achieves minutiae F1-scores in the range of $0.83\pm0.02$ and Rank-1 identification accuracies between 97.0% and 99.1%, while maintaining an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.5%. These results correspond to improvements of up to 4.8% in F1-score and 1.4% in Rank-1 accuracy when compared to prior methods, using only 0.38 million parameters and 6.63 giga floating-point operations, which represents up to ten times fewer parameters than competitive baselines. This highlights the scalability and effectiveness of G-MSGINet in real-world contactless biometric recognition scenarios.

  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal perception capabilities, garnering significant attention. While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks-fundamental to computer vision-remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 1.01 million questions and 0.33 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on twelve representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available atthis https URL.

  Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  6D pose estimation aims at determining the object pose that best explains the camera observation. The unique solution for non-ambiguous objects can turn into a multi-modal pose distribution for symmetrical objects or when occlusions of symmetry-breaking elements happen, depending on the viewpoint. Currently, 6D pose estimation methods are benchmarked on datasets that consider, for their ground truth annotations, visual ambiguities as only related to global object symmetries, whereas they should be defined per-image to account for the camera viewpoint. We thus first propose an automatic method to re-annotate those datasets with a 6D pose distribution specific to each image, taking into account the object surface visibility in the image to correctly determine the visual ambiguities. Second, given this improved ground truth, we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art single pose methods and show that this greatly modifies the ranking of these methods. Third, as some recent works focus on estimating the complete set of solutions, we derive a precision/recall formulation to evaluate them against our image-wise distribution ground truth, making it the first benchmark for pose distribution methods on real images.

  Recent advancements in text embedding have significantly improved natural language understanding across many languages, yet Persian remains notably underrepresented in large-scale embedding research. In this paper, we present Hakim, a novel state-of-the-art Persian text embedding model that achieves a 8.5% performance improvement over existing approaches on the FaMTEB benchmark, outperforming all previously developed Persian language models. As part of this work, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios. Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

  The alignment of large language models (LLMs) often assumes that using more clean data yields better outcomes, overlooking the match between model capacity and example difficulty. Challenging this, we propose a new principle: Preference data vary in difficulty, and overly difficult examples hinder alignment, by exceeding the model's capacity. Through systematic experimentation, we validate this principle with three key findings: (1) preference examples vary in difficulty, as evidenced by consistent learning orders across alignment runs; (2) overly difficult examples significantly degrade performance across four LLMs and two datasets; and (3) the capacity of a model dictates its threshold for handling difficult examples, underscoring a critical relationship between data selection and model capacity. Building on this principle, we introduce Selective DPO, which filters out overly difficult examples. This simple adjustment improves alignment performance by 9-16% in win rates on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark compared to the DPO baseline, suppressing a series of DPO variants with different algorithmic adjustments. Together, these results illuminate the importance of aligning data difficulty with model capacity, offering a transformative perspective for improving alignment strategies in LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in general practice. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks primarily depend on exam-style or simplified question-answer formats, lacking a competency-based structure aligned with the real-world clinical responsibilities encountered in general practice. Consequently, the extent to which LLMs can reliably fulfill the duties of general practitioners (GPs) remains uncertain. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation framework to assess the capability of LLMs to function as GPs. Based on this framework, we introduce a general practice benchmark (GPBench), whose data are meticulously annotated by domain experts in accordance with routine clinical practice standards. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their competencies. Our findings indicate that current LLMs are not yet ready for deployment in such settings without human oversight, and further optimization specifically tailored to the daily responsibilities of GPs is essential.

  Transformer-based embedding methods have dominated the field of sentence representation in recent years. Although they have achieved remarkable performance on NLP missions, such as semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, their black-box nature and large-data-driven training style have raised concerns, including issues related to bias, trust, and safety. Many efforts have been made to improve the interpretability of embedding models, but these problems have not been fundamentally resolved. To achieve inherent interpretability, we propose a purely white-box and human-like sentence representation network, PropNet. Inspired by findings from cognitive science, PropNet constructs a hierarchical network based on the propositions contained in a sentence. While experiments indicate that PropNet has a significant gap compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models in STS tasks, case studies reveal substantial room for improvement. Additionally, PropNet enables us to analyze and understand the human cognitive processes underlying STS benchmarks.

  In this paper, we introduce FAMMA, an open-source benchmark for \underline{f}in\underline{a}ncial \underline{m}ultilingual \underline{m}ultimodal question \underline{a}nswering (QA). Our benchmark aims to evaluate the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in answering complex reasoning questions that require advanced financial knowledge. The benchmark has two versions: FAMMA-Basic consists of 1,945 questions extracted from university textbooks and exams, along with human-annotated answers and rationales; FAMMA-LivePro consists of 103 novel questions created by human domain experts, with answers and rationales held out from the public for a contamination-free evaluation. These questions cover advanced knowledge of 8 major subfields in finance (e.g., corporate finance, derivatives, and portfolio management). Some are in Chinese or French, while a majority of them are in English. Each question has some non-text data such as charts, diagrams, or tables. Our experiments reveal that FAMMA poses a significant challenge on LLMs, including reasoning models such as GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Additionally, we curated 1,270 reasoning trajectories of DeepSeek-R1 on the FAMMA-Basic data, and fine-tuned a series of open-source Qwen models using this reasoning data. We found that training a model on these reasoning trajectories can significantly improve its performance on FAMMA-LivePro. We released our leaderboard, data, code, and trained models atthis https URL.

  In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family. Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g., QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc., competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119 languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) showcase varied multilingual capabilities across tasks like translation, code generation, and reasoning. Previous assessments often limited their scope to fundamental natural language processing (NLP) or isolated capability-specific tasks. To alleviate this drawback, we aim to present a comprehensive multilingual multitask benchmark. First, we introduce P-MMEval, a large-scale benchmark covering effective fundamental and capability-specialized datasets. Furthermore, P-MMEval delivers consistent language coverage across various datasets and provides parallel samples. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on representative multilingual model series to compare performances across models and tasks, explore the relationship between multilingual performances and factors such as tasks, model sizes, languages, and prompts, and examine the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from English to other languages. The resulting insights are intended to offer valuable guidance for future research. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.

  Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.

  Actor-critic methods, like Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), depend on basic noise-based exploration, which can result in less than optimal policy convergence. In this study, we introduce Monte Carlo Beam Search (MCBS), a new hybrid method that combines beam search and Monte Carlo rollouts with TD3 to improve exploration and action selection. MCBS produces several candidate actions around the policy's output and assesses them through short-horizon rollouts, enabling the agent to make better-informed choices. We test MCBS across various continuous-control benchmarks, including HalfCheetah-v4, Walker2d-v5, and Swimmer-v5, showing enhanced sample efficiency and performance compared to standard TD3 and other baseline methods like SAC, PPO, and A2C. Our findings emphasize MCBS's capability to enhance policy learning through structured look-ahead search while ensuring computational efficiency. Additionally, we offer a detailed analysis of crucial hyperparameters, such as beam width and rollout depth, and explore adaptive strategies to optimize MCBS for complex control tasks. Our method shows a higher convergence rate across different environments compared to TD3, SAC, PPO, and A2C. For instance, we achieved 90% of the maximum achievable reward within around 200 thousand timesteps compared to 400 thousand timesteps for the second-best method.

  Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming (DIDP) is a state-space search paradigm based on dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization. In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.

  Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for real-world applications, and multi-agent interactions introduce additional safety challenges. While Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) has been a powerful proposal to enforce safety in single-agent RL, their generalizability to multi-agent settings remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting extensive analyses of PLS within decentralized, multi-agent environments, and in doing so, propose Shielded Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL) as a general framework for steering MARL towards norm-compliant outcomes. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel Probabilistic Logic Temporal Difference (PLTD) update for shielded, independent Q-learning, which incorporates probabilistic constraints directly into the value update process; (2) a probabilistic logic policy gradient method for shielded PPO with formal safety guarantees for MARL; and (3) comprehensive evaluation across symmetric and asymmetrically shielded $n$-player game-theoretic benchmarks, demonstrating fewer constraint violations and significantly better cooperation under normative constraints. These results position SMARL as an effective mechanism for equilibrium selection, paving the way toward safer, socially aligned multi-agent systems.

  Language Models (LMs) continue to advance, improving response quality and coherence. Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered much of what users might ask them to generate in some form during their training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However, the human effort required for benchmark construction is limited and being rapidly outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation. Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g., a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96 and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79. This novel tool supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this methodology to evaluate model performance on a recent relevant arXiv preprint, discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma3 models.

  This study evaluates and extends the findings made by Piatti et al., who introduced GovSim, a simulation framework designed to assess the cooperative decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in resource-sharing scenarios. By replicating key experiments, we validate claims regarding the performance of large models, such as GPT-4-turbo, compared to smaller models. The impact of the universalization principle is also examined, with results showing that large models can achieve sustainable cooperation, with or without the principle, while smaller models fail without it. In addition, we provide multiple extensions to explore the applicability of the framework to new settings. We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario using Japanese instructions, and explore an "inverse environment" where agents must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages, offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective cooperative AI systems.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.
