- **[DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426)**  `arXiv:2509.10426`  `cs.RO` `cs.MA`  
  _Jianxin Shi, Zengqi Peng, Xiaolong Chen, Tianyu Wo, Jun Ma_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.

- **[GC-VLN: Instruction as Graph Constraints for Training-free Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10454)**  `arXiv:2509.10454`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Hang Yin, Haoyu Wei, Xiuwei Xu, Wenxuan Guo, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and autonomous navigation framework.

- **[HHI-Assist: A Dataset and Benchmark of Human-Human Interaction in Physical Assistance Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10096)**  `arXiv:2509.10096`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing labor shortage and aging population underline the need for assistive robots to support human care recipients. To enable safe and responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to significantly enhance robotic assistance policies.

- **[OmniEVA: Embodied Versatile Planner via Task-Adaptive 3D-Grounded and Embodiment-aware Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09332)**  `arXiv:2509.09332`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page:this https URL

- **[DiffAero: A GPU-Accelerated Differentiable Simulation Framework for Efficient Quadrotor Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10247)**  `arXiv:2509.10247`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xinhong Zhang, Runqing Wang, Yunfan Ren, Jian Sun, Hao Fang, Jie Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This letter introduces DiffAero, a lightweight, GPU-accelerated, and fully differentiable simulation framework designed for efficient quadrotor control policy learning. DiffAero supports both environment-level and agent-level parallelism and integrates multiple dynamics models, customizable sensor stacks (IMU, depth camera, and LiDAR), and diverse flight tasks within a unified, GPU-native training interface. By fully parallelizing both physics and rendering on the GPU, DiffAero eliminates CPU-GPU data transfer bottlenecks and delivers orders-of-magnitude improvements in simulation throughput. In contrast to existing simulators, DiffAero not only provides high-performance simulation but also serves as a research platform for exploring differentiable and hybrid learning algorithms. Extensive benchmarks and real-world flight experiments demonstrate that DiffAero and hybrid learning algorithms combined can learn robust flight policies in hours on consumer-grade hardware. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Towards simulation-based optimization of compliant fingers for high-speed connector assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10012)**  `arXiv:2509.10012`  `cs.RO`  
  _Richard Matthias Hartisch, Alexander Rother, J√∂rg Kr√ºger, Kevin Haninger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mechanical compliance is a key design parameter for dynamic contact-rich manipulation, affecting task success and safety robustness over contact geometry variation. Design of soft robotic structures, such as compliant fingers, requires choosing design parameters which affect geometry and stiffness, and therefore manipulation performance and robustness. Today, these parameters are chosen through either hardware iteration, which takes significant development time, or simplified models (e.g. planar), which can't address complex manipulation task objectives. Improvements in dynamic simulation, especially with contact and friction modeling, present a potential design tool for mechanical compliance. We propose a simulation-based design tool for compliant mechanisms which allows design with respect to task-level objectives, such as success rate. This is applied to optimize design parameters of a structured compliant finger to reduce failure cases inside a tolerance window in insertion tasks. The improvement in robustness is then validated on a real robot using tasks from the benchmark NIST task board. The finger stiffness affects the tolerance window: optimized parameters can increase tolerable ranges by a factor of 2.29, with workpiece variation up to 8.6 mm being compensated. However, the trends remain task-specific. In some tasks, the highest stiffness yields the widest tolerable range, whereas in others the opposite is observed, motivating need for design tools which can consider application-specific geometry and dynamics.

- **[MimicDroid: In-Context Learning for Humanoid Robot Manipulation from Human Play Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09769)**  `arXiv:2509.09769`  `cs.RO`  
  _Rutav Shah, Shuijing Liu, Qi Wang, Zhenyu Jiang, Sateesh Kumar, Mingyo Seo, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We aim to enable humanoid robots to efficiently solve new manipulation tasks from a few video examples. In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time. To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher success rates in the real world. Additional materials can be found on:this http URL

- **[Object-Centric Kinodynamic Planning for Nonprehensile Robot Rearrangement Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00261)**  `arXiv:2410.00261`  `cs.RO`  
  _Kejia Ren, Gaotian Wang, Andrew S. Morgan, Lydia E. Kavraki, Kaiyu Hang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonprehensile actions such as pushing are crucial for addressing multi-object rearrangement problems. Many traditional methods generate robot-centric actions, which differ from intuitive human strategies and are typically inefficient. To this end, we adopt an object-centric planning paradigm and propose a unified framework for addressing a range of large-scale, physics-intensive nonprehensile rearrangement problems challenged by modeling inaccuracies and real-world uncertainties. By assuming each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, our planner first computes desired object motions, which are then realized through robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric planning framework can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency. In addition, we propose a benchmarking protocol to standardize and facilitate future research in nonprehensile rearrangement.

- **[LoFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Long-tailed Semi-Supervised Learning in Open-World Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09926)**  `arXiv:2509.09926`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Jiahao Chen, Zhiyuan Huang, Yurou Liu, Bing Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

- **[The Overcooked Generalisation Challenge: Evaluating Cooperation with Novel Partners in Unknown Environments Using Unsupervised Environment Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17949)**  `arXiv:2406.17949`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.MA`  
  _Constantin Ruhdorfer, Matteo Bortoletto, Anna Penzkofer, Andreas Bulling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge (OGC) - a new benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) agents on their ability to cooperate with unknown partners in unfamiliar environments. Existing work typically evaluated cooperative RL only in their training environment or with their training partners, thus seriously limiting our ability to understand agents' generalisation capacity - an essential requirement for future collaboration with humans. The OGC extends Overcooked-AI to support dual curriculum design (DCD). It is fully GPU-accelerated, open-source, and integrated into the minimax DCD benchmark suite. Compared to prior DCD benchmarks, where designers manipulate only minimal elements of the environment, OGC introduces a significantly richer design space: full kitchen layouts with multiple objects that require the designer to account for interaction dynamics between agents. We evaluate state-of-the-art DCD algorithms alongside scalable neural architectures and find that current methods fail to produce agents that generalise effectively to novel layouts and unfamiliar partners. Our results indicate that both agents and curriculum designers struggle with the joint challenge of partner and environment generalisation. These findings establish OGC as a demanding testbed for cooperative generalisation and highlight key directions for future research. We open-source our code.

- **[Latency and Token-Aware Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09864)**  `arXiv:2509.09864`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jenny Y. Huang, Mehul Damani, Yousef El-Kurdi, Ramon Astudillo, Wei Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful way to improve large language model (LLM) performance by generating multiple candidate responses and selecting among them. However, existing work on dynamic allocation for test-time compute typically considers only parallel generation methods such as best-of-N, overlooking incremental decoding methods like beam search, and has largely ignored latency, focusing only on token usage. We formulate inference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method selection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much compute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates both token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user experience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue multiple queries efficiently. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms static strategies, achieving favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs while remaining practical for deployment.

  We introduce open-sci-ref, a family of dense transformer models trained as research baselines across multiple model (0.13B to 1.7B parameters) and token scales (up to 1T) on 8 recent open reference datasets. Evaluating the models on various standardized benchmarks, our training runs set establishes reference points that enable researchers to assess the sanity and quality of alternative training approaches across scales and datasets. Intermediate checkpoints allow comparison and studying of the training dynamics. The established reference baselines allow training procedures to be compared through their scaling trends, aligning them on a common compute axis. Comparison of open reference datasets reveals that training on NemoTron-CC HQ consistently outperforms other reference datasets, followed by DCLM-baseline and FineWeb-Edu. In addition to intermediate training checkpoints, the release includes logs, code, and downstream evaluations to simplify reproduction, standardize comparison, and facilitate future research.

- **[BenchECG and xECG: a benchmark and baseline for ECG foundation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10151)**  `arXiv:2509.10151`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are inexpensive, widely used, and well-suited to deep learning. Recently, interest has grown in developing foundation models for ECGs - models that generalise across diverse downstream tasks. However, consistent evaluation has been lacking: prior work often uses narrow task selections and inconsistent datasets, hindering fair comparison. Here, we introduce BenchECG, a standardised benchmark comprising a comprehensive suite of publicly available ECG datasets and versatile tasks. We also propose xECG, an xLSTM-based recurrent model trained with SimDINOv2 self-supervised learning, which achieves the best BenchECG score compared to publicly available state-of-the-art models. In particular, xECG is the only publicly available model to perform strongly on all datasets and tasks. By standardising evaluation, BenchECG enables rigorous comparison and aims to accelerate progress in ECG representation learning. xECG achieves superior performance over earlier approaches, defining a new baseline for future ECG foundation models.

- **[Limited Reference, Reliable Generation: A Two-Component Framework for Tabular Data Generation in Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09960)**  `arXiv:2509.09960`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Mingxuan Jiang, Yongxin Wang, Ziyue Dai, Yicun Liu, Hongyi Nie, Sen Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic tabular data generation is increasingly essential in data management, supporting downstream applications when real-world and high-quality tabular data is insufficient. Existing tabular generation approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then" rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.

- **[LAVa: Layer-wise KV Cache Eviction with Dynamic Budget Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09754)**  `arXiv:2509.09754`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yiqun Shen, Song Yuan, Zhengze Zhang, Xiaoliang Wang, Daxin Jiang, Nguyen Cam-Tu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  KV Cache is commonly used to accelerate LLM inference with long contexts, yet its high memory demand drives the need for cache compression. Existing compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies. Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks (e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[HiLight: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework with Global Adversarial Guidance for Large-Scale Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14391)**  `arXiv:2506.14391`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yaqiao Zhu, Hongkai Wen, Geyong Min, Man Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.

- **[AReaL: A Large-Scale Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning System for Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24298)**  `arXiv:2505.24298`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wei Fu, Jiaxuan Gao, Xujie Shen, Chen Zhu, Zhiyu Mei, Chuyi He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominant paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous, alternating generation and training in a batch setting where rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same model. This approach stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency: generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model updates, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a fully asynchronous RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves up to 2.77$\times$ training speedup compared to synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available atthis https URL.

- **[Inpainting-Guided Policy Optimization for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10396)**  `arXiv:2509.10396`  `cs.LG`  
  _Siyan Zhao, Mengchen Liu, Jing Huang, Miao Liu, Chenyu Wang, Bo Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as promising alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, offering competitive performance while supporting unique generation capabilities such as inpainting. We explore how inpainting can inform RL algorithm design for dLLMs. Aligning LLMs with reinforcement learning faces an exploration challenge: sparse reward signals and sample waste when models fail to discover correct solutions. While this inefficiency affects LLMs broadly, dLLMs offer a distinctive opportunity--their inpainting ability can guide exploration. We introduce IGPO (Inpainting Guided Policy Optimization), an RL framework that strategically inserts partial ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling. Unlike providing full solutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces while preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such as GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO restores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also propose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that better align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques including entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains across three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new state-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs.

- **[ARMA Block: A CNN-Based Autoregressive and Moving Average Module for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10324)**  `arXiv:2509.10324`  `cs.LG`  
  _Myung Jin Kim, YeongHyeon Park, Il Dong Yun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a simple yet effective convolutional module for long-term time series forecasting. The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings. Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore, analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for positional embeddings in sequential models.

- **[Hadamard-Riemannian Optimization for Margin-Variance Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10189)**  `arXiv:2509.10189`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zexu Jin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensemble learning has been widely recognized as a pivotal technique for boosting predictive performance by combining multiple base models. Nevertheless, conventional margin-based ensemble methods predominantly focus on maximizing the expected margin while neglecting the critical role of margin variance, which inherently restricts the generalization capability of the model and heightens its vulnerability to overfitting, particularly in noisy or imbalanced datasets. Additionally, the conventional approach of optimizing ensemble weights within the probability simplex often introduces computational inefficiency and scalability challenges, complicating its application to large-scale problems. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces a novel ensemble learning framework that explicitly incorporates margin variance into the loss function. Our method jointly optimizes the negative expected margin and its variance, leading to enhanced robustness and improved generalization performance. Moreover, by reparameterizing the ensemble weights onto the unit sphere, we substantially simplify the optimization process and improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional margin-based ensemble techniques, underscoring its effectiveness and practical utility.

- **[Uncertainty-Aware Tabular Prediction: Evaluating VBLL-Enhanced TabPFN in Safety-Critical Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10048)**  `arXiv:2509.10048`  `cs.LG`  
  _Madhushan Ramalingam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predictive models are being increasingly used across a wide range of domains, including safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and criminal justice. Reliable uncertainty estimation is a crucial task in such settings. Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a recently proposed machine learning foundation model for tabular dataset, which uses a generative transformer architecture. Variational Bayesian Last Layers (VBLL) is a state-of-the-art lightweight variational formulation that effectively improves uncertainty estimation with minimal computational overhead. In this work we aim to evaluate the performance of VBLL integrated with the recently proposed TabPFN in uncertainty calibration. Our experiments, conducted on three benchmark medical tabular datasets, compare the performance of the original TabPFN and the VBLL-integrated version. Contrary to expectations, we observed that original TabPFN consistently outperforms VBLL integrated TabPFN in uncertainty calibration across all datasets.

- **[DyKen-Hyena: Dynamic Kernel Generation via Cross-Modal Attention for Multimodal Intent Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09940)**  `arXiv:2509.09940`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yifei Wang, Wenbin Wang, Yong Luo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though Multimodal Intent Recognition (MIR) proves effective by utilizing rich information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the potential for intent-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities may hinder performance from being further improved. Most current models attempt to fuse modalities by applying mechanisms like multi-head attention to unimodal feature sequences and then adding the result back to the original representation. This process risks corrupting the primary linguistic features with noisy or irrelevant non-verbal signals, as it often fails to capture the fine-grained, token-level influence where non-verbal cues should modulate, not just augment, textual meaning. To address this, we introduce DyKen-Hyena, which reframes the problem from feature fusion to processing modulation. Our model translates audio-visual cues into dynamic, per-token convolutional kernels that directly modulate textual feature extraction. This fine-grained approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks. Notably, it yields a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection, validating that our method creates a fundamentally more robust intent representation.

  The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) with varying computational costs and performance profiles presents a critical challenge for scalable, cost-effective deployment in real-world applications. We introduce a unified routing framework that leverages a single-head cross-attention mechanism to jointly model query and model embeddings, enabling dynamic selection of the optimal LLM for each input query. Our approach is evaluated on RouterBench, a large-scale, publicly available benchmark encompassing diverse LLM pools and domains. By explicitly capturing fine-grained query-model interactions, our router predicts both response quality and generation cost, achieving up to 6.6% improvement in Average Improvement in Quality (AIQ) and 2.9% in maximum performance over existing routers. To robustly balance performance and cost, we propose an exponential reward function that enhances stability across user preferences. The resulting architecture is lightweight, generalizes effectively across domains, and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to prior methods, establishing a new standard for cost-aware LLM routing.

  K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a more parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and affordable. K2-Think is freely available atthis http URL, offering best-in-class inference speeds of over 2,000 tokens per second per request via the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine.

  AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce Medex, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing information in concise fair-use facts. Medex consists of 32.3 million pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e. SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM, CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). Medex is highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average. Models built with Medex can be used as constraints while optimizing for novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly as effective. We release our dataset atthis https URL, and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) deliver strong zero-shot recognition but frequently inherit social biases from their training data. We systematically disentangle three design factors -- model size, training-data scale, and training-data source -- by comparing CLIP and OpenCLIP, two models that share an identical contrastive objective yet differ in encoder width and in the image-text corpora on which they are pre-trained (400M proprietary pairs vs. 400M/2B LAION). Across balanced face-analysis benchmarks, enlarging the encoder reduces gender skew in CLIP but amplifies both gender and racial skew in OpenCLIP; increasing the LAION corpus from 400M to 2B further increases OpenCLIP bias. At matched model and data budgets, substituting proprietary data with LAION improves gender fairness while increasing racial skew, underscoring data source as the primary driver of bias patterns. We also evaluate three post-hoc, test-time debiasing strategies -- Bias Prompts, Prompt Array, and SANER. Debiasing reduces but does not eliminate harm, and its effectiveness is source- and size-dependent: Bias Prompts most effectively reduce gender skew in CLIP at smaller model sizes, whereas Prompt Array and SANER more reliably reduce racial skew in OpenCLIP; scaling LAION reconfigures which method is most fair. Taken together, these findings challenge the assumption that bigger models or datasets are automatically fairer and foreground training data source as the key determinant of both bias and mitigation efficacy. We release code and evaluation scripts to enable transparent, reproducible auditing of future VLMs.

  Estimating the construction year of buildings is critical for advancing sustainability, as older structures often lack energy-efficient features. Sustainable urban planning relies on accurate building age data to reduce energy consumption and mitigate climate change. In this work, we introduce MapYourCity, a novel multi-modal benchmark dataset comprising top-view Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery, multi-spectral Earth Observation (EO) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation, and co-localized street-view images across various European cities. Each building is labeled with its construction epoch, and the task is formulated as a seven-class classification problem covering periods from 1900 to the present. To advance research in EO generalization and multi-modal learning, we organized a community-driven data challenge in 2024, hosted by ESA $\Phi$-lab, which ran for four months and attracted wide participation.This paper presents the Top-4 performing models from the challenge and their evaluation results. We assess model generalization on cities excluded from training to prevent data leakage, and evaluate performance under missing modality scenarios, particularly when street-view data is unavailable. Results demonstrate that building age estimation is both feasible and effective, even in previously unseen cities and when relying solely on top-view satellite imagery (i.e. with VHR and Sentinel-2 images). The MapYourCity dataset thus provides a valuable resource for developing scalable, real-world solutions in sustainable urban analytics.

  We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model (VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location. Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical applications. Two variants of VARCO-VISION-2.0 are available at Hugging Face: a full-scale 14B model and a lightweight 1.7B model.

  Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

  Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models, most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from 24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

  Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) have not been adequately tested in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic, and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications.

  General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes 170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications. Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to advance both ITS and LMM research.

  Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na√Øve fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

  Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC. While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment.

  Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description, without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt. Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while remaining imperceptible.

Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

  Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

  With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse, detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

  Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2, with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss), combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

  As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment. Our code is available at this link: \href{this https URL}

  Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed, incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

  Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture, highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion. Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced visual media restoration and enhancement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain. Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features. However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To rigorously assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components within the recently proposed ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking, this paper presents a comprehensive ablation study. The ULW approach combines a U-Net based backbone with a compound loss function that comprises mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) loss, and perceptual loss. The framework also incorporates a differentiable, learnable Wiener filter module. In this study, each component is systematically ablated to evaluate its specific contribution to the overall performance of the whole framework. The analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative visual comparisons.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work, we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP, which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of +10.3\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods, while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is 12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at \hyperlink{this https URL}{this https URL}

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for real-world manga applications.

  _Wenjie Zhu, Yabin Zhang, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng, Lei Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.

  We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

  Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data, with the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation alone producing approximately 1.6TB per day. To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures.We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained object counting remains a major challenge for class-agnostic counting models, which overcount visually similar but incorrect instances (e.g., jalape√±o vs. poblano). Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models efficiently and reliably-without retraining or forgetting previous information-remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks for LLaMA-3 and Mistral backbones demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

  The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad, foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\%, exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only (85.05\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation, offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex cognitive tasks.

  The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as a pivotal open standard, designed to enhance agent-tool integration and interoperability, and is positioned to unlock a new era of powerful, interconnected, and genuinely utilitarian agentic AI. However, despite MCP's growing adoption, existing benchmarks often fail to capture real-world agent performance within this new paradigm, leading to a distorted perception of their true operational value and an inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies. To bridge this critical evaluation gap, we introduce MCP-AgentBench -- a comprehensive benchmark specifically engineered to rigorously assess language agent capabilities in MCP-mediated tool interactions. Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include: the establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers with 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600 systematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of varying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success. Through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide foundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with a standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents capable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating progress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems.

  This study investigates the register variation in texts written by humans and comparable texts produced by large language models (LLMs). Biber's multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used, which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16 frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and ranked in interpretable dimensions.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey. Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating 189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128 question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First, synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances question-answering systems and dialogue generation tasks by integrating information retrieval (IR) technologies with large language models (LLMs). This strategy, which retrieves information from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities of generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG methods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For instance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many retrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex query for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific sub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed, it can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we introduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently tackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG routes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from retrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise resistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare the proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior performance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to deliver ACT. Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions, with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM) and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) = 140.37, p < .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of 2.68 points ($p < .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating `content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent on the underlying training paradigm.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up, management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models (e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an "LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental health applications.

  This work explores the consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in answering multiple times the same question. We present a study on known, open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from the multiple-choice benchmarks MMLU-Redux and MedQA, considering different inference temperatures, small vs. medium models (50B-80B), finetuned vs. base models, and other parameters. We also look into the effects of requiring multi-trial answer consistency on accuracy and the trade-offs involved in deciding which model best provides both of them. To support those studies, we propose some new analytical and graphical tools. Results show that the number of questions which can be answered consistently vary considerably among models but are typically in the 50%-80% range for small models at low inference temperatures. Also, accuracy among consistent answers seems to reasonably correlate with overall accuracy. Results for medium-sized models seem to indicate much higher levels of answer consistency.

  Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the use of external resources for representing the input documents has been underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with 23\% of the original text while retaining 90\% of the information. We assess the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\% on popular benchmarks, while improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling specialized tasks, including medical problem-solving. However, most studies predominantly focus on English-language contexts. This study introduces a novel benchmark dataset based on Polish medical licensing and specialization exams (LEK, LDEK, PES) taken by medical doctor candidates and practicing doctors pursuing specialization. The dataset was web-scraped from publicly available resources provided by the Medical Examination Center and the Chief Medical Chamber. It comprises over 24,000 exam questions, including a subset of parallel Polish-English corpora, where the English portion was professionally translated by the examination center for foreign candidates. By creating a structured benchmark from these existing exam questions, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including general-purpose, domain-specific, and Polish-specific models, and compare their performance against human medical students. Our analysis reveals that while models like GPT-4o achieve near-human performance, significant challenges persist in cross-lingual translation and domain-specific understanding. These findings underscore disparities in model performance across languages and medical specialties, highlighting the limitations and ethical considerations of deploying LLMs in clinical practice.

  Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.

  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts, Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage, making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.

  Efficient hospital management systems (HMS) are critical worldwide to address challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, and poor availability of urgent health care. Existing methods often lack the ability to provide accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2 Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text. Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and F1-scores of 68.5\%, 69.08\%, and 68.5\%, respectively. Comparative benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.

  Minority languages in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, and Traditional Mongolian, face significant challenges due to their unique writing systems, which differ from international standards. This discrepancy has led to a severe lack of relevant corpora, particularly for supervised tasks like headline generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset, Chinese Minority Headline Generation (CMHG), which includes 100,000 entries for Tibetan, and 50,000 entries each for Uyghur and Mongolian, specifically curated for headline generation tasks. Additionally, we propose a high-quality test set annotated by native speakers, designed to serve as a benchmark for future research in this domain. We hope this dataset will become a valuable resource for advancing headline generation in Chinese minority languages and contribute to the development of related benchmarks.

  Chinese ancient documents, invaluable carriers of millennia of Chinese history and culture, hold rich knowledge across diverse fields but face challenges in digitization and understanding, i.e., traditional methods only scan images, while current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with their visual and linguistic complexity. Existing document benchmarks focus on English printed texts or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for evaluating VLMs on ancient Chinese documents. To address this, we present AncientDoc, the first benchmark for Chinese ancient documents, designed to assess VLMs from OCR to knowledge reasoning. AncientDoc includes five tasks (page-level OCR, vernacular translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA) and covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Based on AncientDoc, we evaluate mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics, supplemented by a human-aligned large language model for scoring.

  Entity linking (EL) for biomedical text is typically benchmarked on English-only corpora with flat mentions, leaving the more realistic scenario of nested and multilingual mentions largely unexplored. We present our system for the BioNNE 2025 Multilingual Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking shared task (English & Russian), closing this gap with a lightweight pipeline that keeps the original EL model intact and modifies only three task-aligned components: Two-stage retrieval-ranking. We leverage the same base encoder model in both stages: the retrieval stage uses the original pre-trained model, while the ranking stage applies domain-specific fine-tuning. Boundary cues. In the ranking stage, we wrap each mention with learnable [Ms] / [Me] tags, providing the encoder with an explicit, language-agnostic span before robustness to overlap and nesting. Dataset augmentation. We also automatically expand the ranking training corpus with three complementary data sources, enhancing coverage without extra manual annotation. On the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, our two stage system, bilingual bert (BIBERT-Pipe), ranks third in the multilingual track, demonstrating the effectiveness and competitiveness of these minimal yet principled modifications.

  Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and code will be open-source atthis https URL.

  Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

  Understanding how emotional expression in language relates to brain function is a challenge in computational neuroscience and affective computing. Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating AI emotional expression.

  Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii) cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities, incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse communities in LLM development.

  NLP benchmarks rely on standardized datasets for training and evaluating models and are crucial for advancing the field. Traditionally, expert annotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation does not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by modern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often comes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance the annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing datasets. In this work, we consider the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge, leveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. We conduct a case study on four factual consistency datasets from the TRUE benchmark, spanning diverse NLP tasks, and on SummEval, which uses Likert-scale ratings of summary quality across multiple dimensions. We empirically analyze the labeling quality of existing datasets and compare expert, crowd-sourced, and LLM-based annotations in terms of the agreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each annotation method. Our findings reveal a substantial number of label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in reported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs' so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve performance.

  Auto-evaluation is crucial for assessing response quality and offering feedback for model development. Recent studies have explored training large language models (LLMs) as generative judges to evaluate and critique other models' outputs. In this work, we investigate the idea of learning from both positive and negative data with preference optimization to enhance the evaluation capabilities of LLM judges across an array of different use cases. We achieve this by employing three approaches to collect the preference pairs for different use cases, each aimed at improving our generative judge from a different perspective. Our comprehensive study over a wide range of benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our generative judge achieves the best performance on 10 out of 13 benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-4o and specialized judge models. Further analysis show that our judge model robustly counters inherent biases such as position and length bias, flexibly adapts to any evaluation protocol specified by practitioners, and provides helpful language feedback for improving downstream generator models.

  Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.

  As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm

  A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner.Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a framework for safer, auditable reasoning.

  Evaluating explainable AI (XAI) approaches is a challenging task in general, due to the subjectivity of explanations. In this paper, we focus on tabular data and the specific use case of AI models predicting the values of Boolean functions. We extend the previous work in this domain by proposing a formal and precise measure of importance of variables based on actual causality, and we evaluate state-of-the-art XAI tools against this measure. We also present a novel XAI tool B-ReX, based on the existing tool ReX, and demonstrate that it is superior to other black-box XAI tools on a large-scale benchmark. Specifically, B-ReX achieves a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.072 $\pm$ 0.012 on random 10-valued Boolean formulae

  Autoformalization has emerged as a term referring to the automation of formalization - specifically, the formalization of mathematics using interactive theorem provers (proof assistants). Its rapid development has been driven by progress in deep learning, especially large language models (LLMs). More recently, the term has expanded beyond mathematics to describe the broader task of translating informal input into formal logical representations. At the same time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal language into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge representation - often without explicitly referring to this process as autoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely independent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could accelerate progress. The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit - instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a unified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to advance the development of next generation AI systems.

  The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples, limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs benchmarks with reasonable rationales.
