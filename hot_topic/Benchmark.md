  There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

- **[Robust Offline Imitation Learning Through State-level Trajectory Stitching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22524)**  `arXiv:2503.22524`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Imitation learning (IL) has proven effective for enabling robots to acquire visuomotor skills through expert demonstrations. However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.

  Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS) designed to simulate the deliberation process within the framework of the Indian justice system.Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations, specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable legal grounding via RAG.

- **[Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04419)**  `arXiv:2509.04419`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate, and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and families.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice systems.

- **[IPA: An Information-Preserving Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398)**  `arXiv:2509.04398`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.

- **[An Analysis of Action-Value Temporal-Difference Methods That Learn State Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09523)**  `arXiv:2507.09523`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Brett Daley, Prabhat Nagarajan, Martha White, Marlos C. Machado_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping: using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

- **[Breaking the Context Bottleneck on Long Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16572)**  `arXiv:2412.16572`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Chao Ma, Yikai Hou, Xiang Li, Yinggang Sun, Haining Yu, Zhou Fang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-term time-series forecasting is essential for planning and decision-making in economics, energy, and transportation, where long foresight is required. To obtain such long foresight, models must be both efficient and effective in processing long sequence. Recent advancements have enhanced the efficiency of these models; however, the challenge of effectively leveraging longer sequences persists. This is primarily due to the tendency of these models to overfit when presented with extended inputs, necessitating the use of shorter input lengths to maintain tolerable error margins. In this work, we investigate the multiscale modeling method and propose the Logsparse Decomposable Multiscaling (LDM) framework for the efficient and effective processing of long sequences. We demonstrate that by decoupling patterns at different scales in time series, we can enhance predictability by reducing non-stationarity, improve efficiency through a compact long input representation, and simplify the architecture by providing clear task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that LDM not only outperforms all baselines in long-term forecasting benchmarks, but also reducing both training time and memory costs.

- **[PagedEviction: Structured Block-wise KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04377)**  `arXiv:2509.04377`  `cs.LG`  
  _Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Jie Ye, Xian-He Sun, Anthony Kougkas, Murali Emani, Venkatram Vishwanath, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens, enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention. Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

- **[Characteristic Energy Behavior Profiling of Non-Residential Buildings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04322)**  `arXiv:2509.04322`  `cs.LG`  
  _Haley Dozier, Althea Henslee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology, individual building behavior will be represented with models that can accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to illustrate this methodology.

- **[Rethinking the long-range dependency in Mamba/SSM and transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04226)**  `arXiv:2509.04226`  `cs.LG`  
  _Cong Ma, Kayvan Najarian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay, which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input data.

- **[One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04208)**  `arXiv:2509.04208`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hao-Nan Shi, Ting-Ji Huang, Lu Han, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models, their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification setting.We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing trends observed in large language models.

- **[Towards Synthesizing Normative Data for Cognitive Assessments Using Generative Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17675)**  `arXiv:2508.17675`  `cs.LG`  
  _Victoria Yan, Honor Chotkowski, Fengran Wang, Xinhui Li, Jessica Saurman, Fadi Nahab, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cognitive assessments require normative data as essential benchmarks for evaluating individual performance. Hence, developing new cognitive tests based on novel image stimuli is challenging due to the lack of readily available normative data. Traditional data collection methods are costly, time-consuming, and infrequently updated, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in generative multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a new approach to generate synthetic normative data from existing cognitive test images. We investigated the feasibility of using MLLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, to synthesize normative textual responses for established image-based cognitive assessments, such as the "Cookie Theft" picture description task. Two distinct prompting strategies-naive prompts with basic instructions and advanced prompts enriched with contextual guidance-were evaluated. Responses were analyzed using embeddings to assess their capacity to distinguish diagnostic groups and demographic variations. Performance metrics included BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Advanced prompting strategies produced synthetic responses that more effectively distinguished between diagnostic groups and captured demographic diversity compared to naive prompts. Superior models generated responses exhibiting higher realism and diversity. BERTScore emerged as the most reliable metric for contextual similarity assessment, while BLEU was less effective for evaluating creative outputs. The LLM-as-a-judge approach provided promising preliminary validation results. Our study demonstrates that generative multimodal LLMs, guided by refined prompting methods, can feasibly generate robust synthetic normative data for existing cognitive tests, thereby laying the groundwork for developing novel image-based cognitive assessments without the traditional limitations.

  Reliable prediction of electricity demand plays a key role in safeguarding grid stability and guiding generation decisions, a need that grows with the decentralization and complexity of modern systems. While classical approaches such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP, TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our results show that simpler models such as GCN, SAGE, or APPNP often outperform more complex alternatives in low-data regimes, while GAT ranks among the strongest architectures in our benchmarks, combining high accuracy with valuable interpretability. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights, revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial dependencies are prominent. Additionally, we demonstrate that ensemble-based expert aggregation strategies, particularly bottom-up combinations, significantly improve robustness and yield state-of-the-art performance across both datasets. These findings highlight the dual promise of GNNs for accurate and interpretable forecasting, and suggest that architectural simplicity coupled with ensemble methods can provide a practical path forward for transparent energy analytics.

- **[Segmenting Action-Value Functions Over Time-Scales in SARSA via TD($Œî$)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14783)**  `arXiv:2411.14783`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mahammad Humayoo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In numerous episodic reinforcement learning (RL) environments, SARSA-based methodologies are employed to enhance policies aimed at maximizing returns over long horizons. Traditional SARSA algorithms face challenges in achieving an optimal balance between bias and variation, primarily due to their dependence on a single, constant discount factor ($\eta$). This investigation enhances the temporal difference decomposition method, TD($\Delta$), by applying it to the SARSA algorithm, now designated as SARSA($\Delta$). SARSA is a widely used on-policy RL method that enhances action-value functions via temporal difference updates. By splitting the action-value function down into components that are linked to specific discount factors, SARSA($\Delta$) makes learning easier across a range of time scales. This analysis makes learning more effective and ensures consistency, particularly in situations where long-horizon improvement is needed. The results of this research show that the suggested strategy works to lower bias in SARSA's updates and speed up convergence in both deterministic and stochastic settings, even in dense reward Atari environments. Experimental results from a variety of benchmark settings show that the proposed SARSA($\Delta$) outperforms existing TD learning techniques in both tabular and deep RL environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world inventory management presents challenges, including dynamic environments and uncertain problem parameters, e.g. demand and lead time distributions. These challenges highlight a research gap, suggesting a need for a unifying framework to model and solve sequential decision-making under parameter uncertainty. We address this by exploring an underexplored area of DRL for inventory management: training generally capable agents (GCAs) under zero-shot generalization (ZSG). Here, GCAs are advanced DRL policies designed to handle a broad range of sampled problem instances with diverse inventory challenges. ZSG refers to the ability to successfully apply learned policies to unseen instances with unknown parameters without retraining.We propose a unifying Super-Markov Decision Process formulation and the Train, then Estimate and Decide (TED) framework to train and deploy a GCA tailored to inventory management applications. The TED framework consists of three phases: training a GCA on varied problem instances, continuously estimating problem parameters during deployment, and making decisions based on these estimates. Applied to periodic review inventory problems with lost sales, cyclic demand patterns, and stochastic lead times, our trained agent, the Generally Capable Lost Sales Network (GC-LSN) consistently outperforms well-known traditional policies when problem parameters are known. Moreover, under conditions where demand and/or lead time distributions are initially unknown and must be estimated, we benchmark against online learning methods that provide worst-case performance guarantees. Our GC-LSN policy, paired with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, is demonstrated to complement these methods by providing superior empirical performance.

  _Ruohong Yang, Peng Hu, Yunfan Li, Xi Peng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations. Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image, often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets over 13 domains. The code will be released.

  Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss; (ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of their shared representations.

- **[Promptception: How Sensitive Are Large Multimodal Models to Prompts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03986)**  `arXiv:2509.03986`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models. This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types, spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust and fair model evaluation.

  We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.

  Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically, our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

  AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction. Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression.

  Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However, CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer, which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL.

  _Haotong Cheng, Zhiqi Zhang, Hao Li, Xinshang Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has substantially advanced the field of Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing research has predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of "Universality" and its associated definitions, which extend the traditional notion of "Generalization" to encompass the ease of transferability of modules. We then propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric that quantifies how readily a given module can be transplanted across models and reveals the combined influence of multiple existing metrics on transferability. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules: the Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and the Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, and other low-level tasks, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PSNR improvement of up to 0.83 dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity. Similar optimization approaches could be applied to a broader range of basic modules, offering a new paradigm for the design of plug-and-play modules.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in semantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The source code will be publicly available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research.

  Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

  Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing approaches.

  Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile (DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input, which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and Recall.

  The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability, focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in real-world settings.

  _Zhu Wenjie, Zhang Yabin, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng, Lei Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.

  Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task. The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

  Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

  In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

  Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food production and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to anthropogenic and environmental stressors. Scalable, automated monitoring in agricultural environments remains an open challenge due to the difficulty of detecting small, fast-moving, and often camouflaged insects. To address this, we present BuzzSet v1.0, a large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected under real field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7,856 manually verified images with more than 8,000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were produced using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined through human verification with open-source tools. All images were preprocessed into 256 x 256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide baselines using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves strong classification accuracy with F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybees and bumblebees, with minimal confusion between these categories. The unidentified class remains more difficult due to label ambiguity and fewer samples, yet still contributes insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection performance (mAP at 0.50 of 0.559) illustrates the challenging nature of the dataset and its potential to drive advances in small object detection under realistic ecological conditions. Future work focuses on expanding the dataset to version 2.0 with additional annotations and evaluating further detection strategies. BuzzSet establishes a benchmark for ecological computer vision, with the primary challenge being reliable detection of insects frequently camouflaged within natural vegetation, highlighting an open problem for future research.

  Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However, generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images. Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction, our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to obtain their results as references, finally "looks again" the image and rethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate hallucinations. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, the results indicate that enhancing expert models, which are typically small and easy to iterate, enable performance improvements for VLMs.

  Spatial Transcriptomics is a groundbreaking technology that integrates histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.

  This work examines the reproducibility and benchmarking of state-of-the-art real-time object detection models. As object detection models are often used in real-world contexts, such as robotics, where inference time is paramount, simply measuring models' accuracy is not enough to compare them. We thus compare a large variety of object detection models' accuracy and inference speed on multiple graphics cards. In addition to this large benchmarking attempt, we also reproduce the following models from scratch using PyTorch on the MS COCO 2017 dataset: DETR, RTMDet, ViTDet and YOLOv7. More importantly, we propose a unified training and evaluation pipeline, based on MMDetection's features, to better compare models. Our implementation of DETR and ViTDet could not achieve accuracy or speed performances comparable to what is declared in the original papers. On the other hand, reproduced RTMDet and YOLOv7 could match such performances. Studied papers are also found to be generally lacking for reproducibility purposes. As for MMDetection pretrained models, speed performances are severely reduced with limited computing resources (larger, more accurate models even more so). Moreover, results exhibit a strong trade-off between accuracy and speed, prevailed by anchor-free models - notably RTMDet or YOLOx models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems, often comprising multiple models, complex tool invocations, and orchestration protocols, substantially outperform monolithic agents. Yet this very sophistication amplifies their fragility, making them more prone to system failure. Pinpointing the specific agent or step responsible for an error within long execution traces defines the task of agentic system failure attribution. Current state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, however, remain strikingly inadequate for this challenge, with accuracy generally below 10%. To address this gap, we propose AgenTracer, the first automated framework for annotating failed multi-agent trajectories via counterfactual replay and programmed fault injection, producing the curated dataset TracerTraj. Leveraging this resource, we develop AgenTracer-8B, a lightweight failure tracer trained with multi-granular reinforcement learning, capable of efficiently diagnosing errors in verbose multi-agent interactions. On the Who&When benchmark, AgenTracer-8B outperforms giant proprietary LLMs like Gemini-2.5-Pro and Claude-4-Sonnet by up to 18.18%, setting a new standard in LLM agentic failure attribution. More importantly, AgenTracer-8B delivers actionable feedback to off-the-shelf multi-agent systems like MetaGPT and MaAS with 4.8-14.2% performance gains, empowering self-correcting and self-evolving agentic AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However, current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG, a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving 10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However, real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34 state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

  The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically, we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

  Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool for doc-mt systems.

  Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings. However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

  Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency, language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54), while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000 images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high affordability.

  _Shanglin Wu, Lihui Liu, Jinho D. Choi, Kai Shu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time. However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM) designed explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we proposethis http URLthat integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model, MiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning mode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform similar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants showing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and generation.

  _Bufan Gao, Elisa Kreiss_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains, evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable real-world scenarios.

  In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

  Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory, which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base. Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted music creation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited, making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language, specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream applications for this underrepresented language.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive. While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios. Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances legal compliance (achieving a +8.58% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability.

  Prompt tuning has emerged as a lightweight strategy for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks, particularly for resource-constrained systems. As pre-trained prompts become valuable assets, combining multiple source prompts offers a promising approach to enhance generalization for new tasks by leveraging complementary knowledge. However, naive aggregation often overlooks different source prompts have different contribution potential to the target task. To address this, we propose HGPrompt, a dynamic framework that learns optimal ensemble weights. These weights are optimized by jointly maximizing an information-theoretic metric for transferability and minimizing gradient conflicts via a novel regularization strategy. Specifically, we propose a differentiable prompt transferability metric to captures the discriminability of prompt-induced features on the target task. Meanwhile, HGPrompt match the gradient variances with respect to different source prompts based on Hessian and Fisher Information, ensuring stable and coherent knowledge transfer while suppressing gradient conflicts among them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale VTAB benchmark demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HGPrompt, validating its effectiveness in learning an optimal ensemble for effective multi-source prompt transfer.

  To mitigate the impact of hallucination nature of LLMs, many studies propose detecting hallucinated generation through uncertainty estimation. However, these approaches predominantly operate at the sentence or paragraph level, failing to pinpoint specific spans or entities responsible for hallucinated content. This lack of granularity is especially problematic for long-form outputs that mix accurate and fabricated information. To address this limitation, we explore entity-level hallucination detection. We propose a new data set, HalluEntity, which annotates hallucination at the entity level. Based on the dataset, we comprehensively evaluate uncertainty-based hallucination detection approaches across 17 modern LLMs. Our experimental results show that uncertainty estimation approaches focusing on individual token probabilities tend to over-predict hallucinations, while context-aware methods show better but still suboptimal performance. Through an in-depth qualitative study, we identify relationships between hallucination tendencies and linguistic properties and highlight important directions for future research.HalluEntity:this https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress in mathematical reasoning, yet often rely on single-paradigm reasoning, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. We introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a novel unified framework integrating multiple reasoning paradigms--Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning (SR)--to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential answers via different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy for models to progressively master these paradigms, leading to CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving and a 15.0% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic tasks. These results show the enhanced mathematical comprehension ability of our model, enabling zero-shot generalization across tasks.

  Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found inthis https URL.

  Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles, making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms. Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

  While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries, promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design, outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.

  Scientific research is inherently global. However, the vast majority of academic journals are published exclusively in English, creating barriers for non-native-English-speaking researchers. In this study, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to translate published scientific articles while preserving their native JATS XML formatting, thereby developing a practical, automated approach for implementation by academic journals. Using our approach, we translate articles across multiple scientific disciplines into 28 languages. To evaluate translation accuracy, we introduce a novel question-and-answer (QA) benchmarking method, in which an LLM generates comprehension-based questions from the original text and then answers them based on the translated text. Our benchmark results show an average performance of 95.9%, showing that the key scientific details are accurately conveyed. In a user study, we translate the scientific papers of 15 researchers into their native languages, finding that the authors consistently found the translations to accurately capture the original information in their articles. Interestingly, a third of the authors found many technical terms "overtranslated," expressing a preference to keep terminology more familiar in English untranslated. Finally, we demonstrate how in-context learning techniques can be used to align translations with domain-specific preferences such as mitigating overtranslation, highlighting the adaptability and utility of LLM-driven scientific translation.

  Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.

  Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still, their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors. The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating local search solver design.

  In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

  Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities, then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent) tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR interpretation.

  Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation. Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment, limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model (LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity, mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation framework.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain; Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making. If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

  In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a "unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC), a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions (NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline, significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

  Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors, and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing insightful reasoning steps to users.

  Constraint Programming (CP) is widely used to solve combinatorial problems, but its core process, namely constraint modelling, requires significant expertise and is considered to be a bottleneck for wider adoption. Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform combinatorial problem descriptions into executable constraint models. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark that includes a diverse set of well-known combinatorial problems sourced from the CP community, structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax. Notably, the results show higher performance when modelling with a high-level Python-based framework. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods across different LLMs, which further increase accuracy, reaching up to 70% on this highly challenging benchmark.
