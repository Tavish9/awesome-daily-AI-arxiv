- **[F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation to Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06951)**  `arXiv:2509.06951`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.

- **[GraspCoT: Integrating Physical Property Reasoning for 6-DoF Grasping under Flexible Language Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16013)**  `arXiv:2503.16013`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flexible instruction-guided 6-DoF grasping is a significant yet challenging task for real-world robotic systems. Existing methods utilize the contextual understanding capabilities of the large language models (LLMs) to establish mappings between expressions and targets, allowing robots to comprehend users' intentions in the instructions. However, the LLM's knowledge about objects' physical properties remains underexplored despite its tight relevance to grasping. In this work, we propose GraspCoT, a 6-DoF grasp detection framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism oriented to physical properties, guided by auxiliary question-answering (QA) tasks. Particularly, we design a set of QA templates to enable hierarchical reasoning that includes three stages: target parsing, physical property analysis, and grasp action selection. Moreover, GraspCoT presents a unified multimodal LLM architecture, which encodes multi-view observations of 3D scenes into 3D-aware visual tokens, and then jointly embeds these visual tokens with CoT-derived textual tokens within LLMs to generate grasp pose predictions. Furthermore, we present IntentGrasp, a large-scale benchmark that fills the gap in public datasets for multi-object grasp detection under diverse and indirect verbal commands. Extensive experiments on IntentGrasp demonstrate the superiority of our method, with additional validation in real-world robotic applications confirming its practicality.

  Imitation learning advances robot capabilities by enabling the acquisition of diverse behaviors from human demonstrations. However, large-scale datasets used for policy training often introduce substantial variability in quality, which can negatively impact performance. As a result, automatically curating datasets by filtering low-quality samples to improve quality becomes essential. Existing robotic curation approaches rely on costly manual annotations and perform curation at a coarse granularity, such as the dataset or trajectory level, failing to account for the quality of individual state-action pairs. To address this, we introduce SCIZOR, a self-supervised data curation framework that filters out low-quality state-action pairs to improve the performance of imitation learning policies. SCIZOR targets two complementary sources of low-quality data: suboptimal data, which hinders learning with undesirable actions, and redundant data, which dilutes training with repetitive patterns. SCIZOR leverages a self-supervised task progress predictor for suboptimal data to remove samples lacking task progression, and a deduplication module operating on joint state-action representation for samples with redundant patterns. Empirically, we show that SCIZOR enables imitation learning policies to achieve higher performance with less data, yielding an average improvement of 15.4% across multiple benchmarks.

- **[TA-VLA: Elucidating the Design Space of Torque-aware Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07962)**  `arXiv:2509.07962`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many robotic manipulation tasks require sensing and responding to force signals such as torque to assess whether the task has been successfully completed and to enable closed-loop control. However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into thethis http URL, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.

- **[Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action for Policy Reasoning in Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07957)**  `arXiv:2509.07957`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Acquiring dexterous robotic skills from human video demonstrations remains a significant challenge, largely due to conventional reliance on low-level trajectory replication, which often fails to generalize across varying objects, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. To address this limitation, we introduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that enables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an information-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively highlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues are structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently integrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance efficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy that autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit geometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly benchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial generalization. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves over 95% graph accuracy and 93% subtask segmentation, enabling the language-action planner to generate robust, interpretable task policies. When deployed on a dual-arm robot, these policies attain 94% grasp reliability, 89% placement accuracy, and 90% overall task success across stacking, letter-formation, and geometric reconfiguration tasks, evidencing strong generalization and robustness under diverse spatial and semantic variations.

- **[Attention and Risk-Aware Decision Framework for Safe Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07412)**  `arXiv:2509.07412`  `cs.RO`

  Autonomous driving has attracted great interest due to its potential capability in full-unsupervised driving. Model-based and learning-based methods are widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined models of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal policy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the above limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However, existing PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training efficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are equivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper develops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a risk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a safety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting areas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO. The balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding vehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during training. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold channel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images. Moreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions with risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation results on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak reward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky areas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios.

  Accurate visual localization in dense urban environments poses a fundamental task in photogrammetry, geospatial information science, and robotics. While imagery is a low-cost and widely accessible sensing modality, its effectiveness on visual odometry is often limited by textureless surfaces, severe viewpoint changes, and long-term drift. The growing public availability of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data opens new avenues for scalable and precise visual localization by leveraging ALS as a prior map. However, the potential of ALS-based localization remains underexplored due to three key limitations: (1) the lack of platform-diverse datasets, (2) the absence of reliable ground-truth generation methods applicable to large-scale urban environments, and (3) limited validation of existing Image-to-Point Cloud (I2P) algorithms under aerial-ground cross-platform settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new large-scale dataset that integrates ground-level imagery from mobile mapping systems with ALS point clouds collected in Wuhan, Hong Kong, and San Francisco.

  This chapter extends the family of perception-informed gap-based local planners to dynamic environments. Existing perception-informed local planners that operate in dynamic environments often rely on emergent or empirical robustness for collision avoidance as opposed to performing formal analysis of dynamic obstacles. This proposed planner, dynamic gap, explicitly addresses dynamic obstacles through several steps in the planning pipeline. First, polar regions of free space known as gaps are tracked and their dynamics are estimated in order to understand how the local environment evolves over time. Then, at planning time, gaps are propagated into the future through novel gap propagation algorithms to understand what regions are feasible for passage. Lastly, pursuit guidance theory is leveraged to generate local trajectories that are provably collision-free under ideal conditions. Additionally, obstacle-centric ungap processing is performed in situations where no gaps exist to robustify the overall planning framework. A set of gap-based planners are benchmarked against a series of classical and learned motion planners in dynamic environments, and dynamic gap is shown to outperform all other baselines in all environments. Furthermore, dynamic gap is deployed on a TurtleBot2 platform in several real-world experiments to validate collision avoidance behaviors.

  Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves SR from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces NE from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

  Human drivers possess spatial and causal intelligence, enabling them to perceive driving scenarios, anticipate hazards, and react to dynamic environments. In contrast, autonomous vehicles lack these abilities, making it challenging to manage perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, especially under complex or unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Benchmarking results show that fine-tuned MLLMs achieve an 11.8\% improvement in close-ended VQA accuracy and a 12.0\% increase in open-ended VQA scores compared to baseline models, while maintaining real-time performance with a 0.59-second average inference time per image. We validate our approach through real-world case studies in Canada and China, where fine-tuned models correctly identify safety risks that challenge even experienced human drivers. This work represents the first application of domain-specific MLLM fine-tuning for SOTIF domain in autonomous driving. The dataset and related resources are available atthis http URL

- **[Adaptive Evolutionary Framework for Safe, Efficient, and Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07411)**  `arXiv:2509.07411`  `cs.MA` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios, while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources. Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and parameter settings.

  Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures. However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning offers a solution for decentralised model training, addressing the difficulties associated with distributed data and privacy in machine learning. However, the fact of data heterogeneity in federated learning frequently hinders the global model's generalisation, leading to low performance and adaptability to unseen data. This problem is particularly critical for specialised applications such as medical imaging, where both the data and the number of clients are limited. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that inconsistencies in client-side training distributions substantially degrade the performance of federated learning models across multiple benchmark datasets. We propose a novel FL framework using a combination of pruning and regularisation of clients' training to improve the sparsity, redundancy, and robustness of neural connections, and thereby the resilience to model aggregation. To address a relatively unexplored dimension of data heterogeneity, we further introduce a novel benchmark dataset, CelebA-Gender, specifically designed to control for within-class distributional shifts across clients based on attribute variations, thereby complementing the predominant focus on inter-class imbalance in prior federated learning research. Comprehensive experiments on many datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, and the newly introduced CelebA-Gender dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard FL baselines, yielding more robust and generalizable models in heterogeneous settings.

  Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations - where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation. But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and \textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

  This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps (4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3) discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive performance characterization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world. In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed. However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL and PDR scheduling methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However, existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1) heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters to repair local components which improves both client and global model performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the presence of modality incompleteness.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the "pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) remains fundamentally hard: without structure, any agent needs $\Omega(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|/p)$ samples to recover rewards. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) as a first concrete step toward a structural reward learning framework. Our key idea is to exploit approximate low-rank + sparse structure in the reward matrix, under policy-biased (MNAR) sampling. We prove recovery guarantees with inverse-propensity weighting, and establish a visitation-weighted error-to-regret bound linking completion error to control performance. Importantly, when assumptions weaken, PAMC degrades gracefully: confidence intervals widen and the algorithm abstains, ensuring safe fallback to exploration. Empirically, PAMC improves sample efficiency across Atari-26 (10M steps), DM Control, MetaWorld MT50, D4RL offline RL, and preference-based RL benchmarks, outperforming DrQ-v2, DreamerV3, Agent57, T-REX/D-REX, and PrefPPO under compute-normalized comparisons. Our results highlight PAMC as a practical and principled tool when structural rewards exist, and as a concrete first instantiation of a broader structural reward learning perspective.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics (notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns, leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning 370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future research on metric learning in deep RL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%, RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require cross-context relations.

  In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available at \textcolor{magenta}{this https URL}.

  K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a more parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and affordable.

  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE (MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN), demonstrating good accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.

  Effective reasoning is crucial to solving complex mathematical problems. Recent large language models (LLMs) have boosted performance by scaling test-time computation through long chain-of-thought reasoning. However, transformer-based models are inherently limited in extending context length due to their quadratic computational complexity and linear memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid linear RNN reasoning model, M1, built on the Mamba architecture, which allows memory-efficient inference. Our approach leverages a distillation process from existing reasoning models and is further enhanced through RL training. Experimental results on the AIME and MATH benchmarks show that M1 not only outperforms previous linear RNN models but also matches the performance of state-of-the-art Deepseek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale. We also compare our generation speed with a highly performant general purpose inference engine, vLLM, and observe more than a 3x speedup compared to a same size transformer. With throughput speedup, we are able to achieve higher accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models under a fixed generation time budget using self-consistency voting. Overall, we introduce a hybrid Mamba reasoning model and provide a more effective approach to scaling test-time generation using self-consistency or long chain of thought reasoning.

  Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids, overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

  Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet, multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned datasets.

  Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in DNNs.

  Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale, open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular, scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature.

  Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy. Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible atthis https URL.

  Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis, scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500 diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise environments.

  Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

  Museums serve as repositories of cultural heritage and historical artifacts from diverse epochs, civilizations, and regions, preserving well-documented collections that encapsulate vast knowledge, which, when systematically structured into large-scale datasets, can train specialized models. Visitors engage with exhibits through curiosity and questions, making expert domain-specific models essential for interactive query resolution and gaining historical insights. Understanding exhibits from images requires analyzing visual features and linking them to historical knowledge to derive meaningful correlations. We facilitate such reasoning by (a) collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 65M images and 200M question-answer pairs for exhibits from all around the world; (b) training large vision-language models (VLMs) on the collected dataset; (c) benchmarking their ability on five visual question answering tasks, specifically designed to reflect real-world inquiries and challenges observed in museum settings. The complete dataset is labeled by museum experts, ensuring the quality and the practical significance of the labels. We train two VLMs from different categories: BLIP with vision-language aligned embeddings, but lacking the expressive power of large language models, and the LLaVA model, a powerful instruction-tuned LLM enriched with vision-language reasoning capabilities. Through extensive experiments, we find that while both model types effectively answer visually grounded questions, large vision-language models excel in queries requiring deeper historical context and reasoning. We further demonstrate the necessity of fine-tuning models on large-scale domain-specific datasets by showing that our fine-tuned models significantly outperform current SOTA VLMs in answering questions related to specific attributes, highlighting their limitations in handling complex, nuanced queries.

  As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds, these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX 4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%. This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that maximize throughput.

  Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

  Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping, embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature space without changing network parameters, they often require access to training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations. Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2 (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset to facilitate further research.

  Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning.

  Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in:this https URL.

  Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training, significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures. It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture understanding.

  Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data, leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias), CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection), we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%} on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility, fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without necessitating full retraining.

  Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

  This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of lightweight deep learning models for image classification, emphasizing their suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as low-memory devices. Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and training paradigms by comparing pretrained models with scratch-trained counterparts, focusing on MobileNetV3 Small. Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited. By addressing these challenges, this research contributes to optimizing deep learning systems for edge computing and mobile platforms.

  Audio often serves as an auxiliary modality in video understanding tasks of audio-visual large language models (LLMs), merely assisting in the comprehension of visual information. However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (AVUT) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. AVUT introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos. Moreover, this work points out the text shortcut problem that largely exists in other benchmarks where the correct answer can be found from question text alone without needing videos. AVUT addresses this problem by proposing a answer permutation-based filtering mechanism. A thorough evaluation across a diverse range of open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs is performed, followed by the analyses of deficiencies in audio-visual LLMs. Demos and data are available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning. We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

  Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:this https URL

  Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then, we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

  3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or 3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective. This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and +6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

  The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition, particularly for ambiguous samples.

  Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets. In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches. Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to $4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) faces severe performance degradation when applied to UAV imagery due to the domain gap from ground-level datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a complete UAV-oriented solution that combines both dataset construction and model innovation. First, we design a refined UAV-Label Engine, which efficiently resolves annotation redundancy, inconsistency, and ambiguity, enabling the generation of largescale UAV datasets. Based on this engine, we construct two new benchmarks: UAVDE-2M, with over 2.4M instances across 1,800+ categories, and UAVCAP-15K, providing rich image-text pairs for vision-language pretraining. Second, we introduce the Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement (CAGE) module, a lightweight dual-path fusion design that integrates cross-attention, adaptive gating, and global FiLM modulation for robust textvision alignment. By embedding CAGE into the YOLO-World-v2 framework, our method achieves significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency, notably improving zero-shot detection on VisDrone by +5.3 mAP while reducing parameters and GFLOPs, and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization on SIMD. Extensive experiments and real-world UAV deployment confirm the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed solution for UAV-based OVD

  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

  Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

  _Raehyuk Jung, Seungjun Yu, Hyunjung Shim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets (rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food production and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to anthropogenic and environmental stressors. Scalable, automated monitoring in agricultural environments remains an open challenge due to the difficulty of detecting small, fast-moving, and often camouflaged insects. To address this, we present BuzzSet v1.0, a large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected under real field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7,856 manually verified images with more than 8,000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were produced using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined through human verification with open-source tools. All images were preprocessed into 256 x 256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide baselines using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves strong classification accuracy with F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybees and bumblebees, with minimal confusion between these categories. The unidentified class remains more difficult due to label ambiguity and fewer samples, yet still contributes insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection performance (mAP at 0.50 of 0.559) illustrates the challenging nature of the dataset and its potential to drive advances in small object detection under realistic ecological conditions. Future work focuses on expanding the dataset to version 2.0 with additional annotations and evaluating further detection strategies. BuzzSet establishes a benchmark for ecological computer vision, with the primary challenge being reliable detection of insects frequently camouflaged within natural vegetation, highlighting an open problem for future research.

  _Bingchen Zhao, Oisin Mac Aodha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional clustering methods aim to group unlabeled data points based on their similarity to each other. However, clustering, in the absence of additional information, is an ill-posed problem as there may be many different, yet equally valid, ways to partition a dataset. Distinct users may want to use different criteria to form clusters in the same data, e.g. shape v.s. color. Recently introduced text-guided image clustering methods aim to address this ambiguity by allowing users to specify the criteria of interest using natural language instructions. This instruction provides the necessary context and control needed to obtain clusters that are more aligned with the users' intent. We propose a new text-guided clustering approach named ITGC that uses an iterative discovery process, guided by an unsupervised clustering objective, to generate interpretable visual concepts that better capture the criteria expressed in a user's instructions. We report superior performance compared to existing methods across a wide variety of image clustering and fine-grained classification benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To address complex pathological feature extraction in automated cardiac MRI segmentation, we propose SAMba-UNet, a novel dual-encoder architecture that synergistically combines the vision foundation model SAM2, the linear-complexity state-space model Mamba, and the classical UNet to achieve cross-modal collaborative feature learning; to overcome domain shifts between natural images and medical scans, we introduce a Dynamic Feature Fusion Refiner that employs multi-scale pooling and channel-spatial dual-path calibration to strengthen small-lesion and fine-structure representation, and we design a Heterogeneous Omni-Attention Convergence Module (HOACM) that fuses SAM2's local positional semantics with Mamba's long-range dependency modeling via global contextual attention and branch-selective emphasis, yielding substantial gains in both global consistency and boundary precision-on the ACDC cardiac MRI benchmark, SAMba-UNet attains a Dice of 0.9103 and HD95 of 1.0859 mm, notably improving boundary localization for challenging structures like the right ventricle, and its robust, high-fidelity segmentation maps are directly applicable as a perception module within intelligent medical and surgical robotic systems to support preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, and postoperative complication screening; the code will be open-sourced to facilitate clinical translation and further validation.

  _Yuhang Gan, Wenjie Xuan, Zhiming Luo, Lei Fang, Zengmao Wang, Juhua Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing the appearance (e.g., color, texture) with the help of semantics (e.g., objects, relations). However, mainstream binary change detection models adopt a supervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main constraint. Thus, such methods primarily emphasize difference-aware features between bi-temporal images, and the semantic understanding of changed landscapes is undermined, resulting in limited accuracy in the face of noise and illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating semantic priors from visual foundation models to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-Aware Change Detection network (SA-CDNet), which transfers the knowledge of visual foundation models (i.e., FastSAM) to change detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream feature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware features and difference-aware features. Secondly, we explore a single-temporal pre-training strategy for better adaptation of visual foundation models. With pseudo-change data constructed from single-temporal segmentation datasets, we employ an extra branch of proxy semantic segmentation task for pre-training. We explore various settings like dataset combinations and landscape types, thus providing valuable insights. Experimental results on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at $\href{this https URL}{github}$.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given two images of different anime roles, anime style recognition (ASR) aims to learn abstract painting style to determine whether the two images are from the same work, which is an interesting but challenging problem. Unlike biometric recognition, such as face recognition, iris recognition, and person re-identification, ASR suffers from a much larger semantic gap but receives less attention. In this paper, we propose a challenging ASR benchmark. Firstly, we collect a large-scale ASR dataset (LSASRD), which contains 20,937 images of 190 anime works and each work at least has ten different roles. In addition to the large-scale, LSASRD contains a list of challenging factors, such as complex illuminations, various poses, theatrical colors and exaggerated compositions. Secondly, we design a cross-role protocol to evaluate ASR performance, in which query and gallery images must come from different roles to validate an ASR model is to learn abstract painting style rather than learn discriminative features of roles. Finally, we apply two powerful person re-identification methods, namely, AGW and TransReID, to construct the baseline performance on LSASRD. Surprisingly, the recent transformer model (i.e., TransReID) only acquires a 42.24% mAP on LSASRD. Therefore, we believe that the ASR task of a huge semantic gap deserves deep and long-term research. We will open our dataset and code atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs, baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a range of downstream tasks.

  _Ke Wang, Yiming Qin, Nikolaos Dimitriadis, Alessandro Favero, Pascal Frossard_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models efficiently and reliably-without retraining or forgetting previous information-remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks for LLaMA-3 and Mistral backbones demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup - in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models. We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark. By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA, and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for balancing model performance with safety requirements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit, multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion). Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization. DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains robust in OOD scenarios. The CAT achieves an average improvement of 5.76% on the STG dataset and 1.56% on downstream tasks. Notably, the OOD performance of the Llama-3.1-8B model on STG_M increased from 64.5% to 90.5%, and Qwen's OOD performance on the STG_H dataset improved from 25.4% to 55.9%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM) capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and code will be open-source atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) make significant progress in Emotional Intelligence (EI) and long-context understanding. However, existing benchmarks tend to overlook certain aspects of EI in long-context scenarios, especially under realistic, practical settings where interactions are lengthy, diverse, and often noisy. To move towards such realistic settings, we present LongEmotion, a benchmark specifically designed for long-context EI tasks. It covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens, with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the differences among various models in terms of EI.

Through this work, we demonstrate that our training strategy enables improvements in domain relevance and performance without the need for large-scale infrastructure. By evaluating the performance of the model using domain-specific question-answering benchmarks, our results demonstrate that EnergyGPT outperforms the base model in most of the energy-related language understanding and generation tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Italian medical university entrance examinations. Sourced from Edizioni Simone, a leading preparatory materials publisher, MedBench-IT comprises 17,410 expert-written multiple-choice questions across six subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Logic, General Culture, Mathematics, Physics) and three difficulty levels. We evaluated diverse models including proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude series) and resource-efficient open-source alternatives (<30B parameters) focusing on practical deployability.Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian NLP community, EdTech developers, and practitioners, offering insights into current capabilities and standardized evaluation methodology for this critical domain.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization. Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

  _Bufan Gao, Elisa Kreiss_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias inthis http URL, we test models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and (2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics. We find that prompts that more clearly align with (gender bias) evaluation framing elicit distinct gender output distributions compared to less evaluation-framed prompts. Discrete-choice metrics further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM "testing mode" performance, and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model alignment before deployment.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in assisting peer review, current methods often struggle to generate thorough and insightful reviews while maintaining efficiency. In this paper, we propose TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to computationally intensive approaches.

  We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive abilities that previously received limited attention in systematic LLM benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600 meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human level on this task.

  Text-to-SQL is a critical task in natural language processing that aims to transform natural language questions into accurate and executable SQL queries. In real-world scenarios, these reasoning tasks are often accompanied by complex mathematical computations, domain knowledge, and hypothetical reasoning scenarios. However, existing large-scale Text-to-SQL datasets typically focus on business logic and task logic, neglecting critical factors such as vertical domain knowledge, complex mathematical reasoning, and hypothetical reasoning, which are essential for realistically reflecting the reasoning demands in practical applications and completing data querying and analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicCat, the first Text-to-SQL benchmark dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning and chain-of-thought parsing, encompassing physics, arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical reasoning scenarios. LogicCat comprises 4,038 English questions paired 12,114 detailed chain-of-thought reasoning steps, spanning 45 databases across diverse domains, significantly surpassing existing datasets in complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that LogicCat substantially increases the task difficulty for current state-of-the-art models to at most 33.20% execution accuracy, indicating that this task remains exceptionally challenging. The advancement of LogicCat represents a crucial step toward developing systems suitable for real-world enterprise data analysis and autonomous query generation.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

  We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o. Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining data curation is a cornerstone in Large Language Model (LLM) development, leading to growing research on quality filtering of large web corpora. From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labelling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters are deemed as valuable examples, others are discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilising registers or genres - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We train small generative models with register classified data and evaluate them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.

  A key frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is the ability to perform deep mathematical and spatial reasoning directly from images, moving beyond their established success in semantic description. Mathematical surface plots provide a rigorous testbed for this capability, as they isolate the task of reasoning from the semantic noise common in natural images. To measure progress on this frontier, we introduce MaRVL-QA (Mathematical Reasoning over Visual Landscapes), a new benchmark designed to quantitatively evaluate these core reasoning skills. The benchmark comprises two novel tasks: Topological Counting, identifying and enumerating features like local maxima; and Transformation Recognition, recognizing applied geometric transformations. Generated from a curated library of functions with rigorous ambiguity filtering, our evaluation on MaRVL-QA reveals that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly, often resorting to superficial heuristics instead of robust spatial reasoning. MaRVL-QA provides a challenging new tool for the research community to measure progress, expose model limitations, and guide the development of MLLMs with more profound reasoning abilities.

  This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable fluency in understanding visual scenes, yet they exhibit a critical lack in a fundamental cognitive skill: object counting. This blind spot severely limits their reliability in real-world applications. To date, this capability has been largely unevaluated in complex scenarios, as existing benchmarks either feature sparse object densities or are confined to specific visual domains, failing to test models under realistic conditions. Addressing this gap, we introduce CountQA, a challenging new benchmark designed to probe this deficiency. Comprising over 1,500 question-answer pairs, CountQA features real-world images with high object density, clutter, and occlusion. We investigate this weakness by evaluating 15 prominent MLLMs on the CountQA benchmark and reveal that the top-performing model achieves a mere 42.9% accuracy, with performance declining as object counts rise. By providing a dedicated benchmark to diagnose and rectify this core weakness, CountQA paves the way for a new generation of MLLMs that are not only descriptively fluent but also numerically grounded and spatially aware. We will open-source the dataset and code upon paper acceptance to foster further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment, adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures, while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

  The increasing demand for domain-specific evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the development of numerous benchmarks. These efforts often adhere to the principle of data scaling, relying on large corpora or extensive question-answer (QA) sets to ensure broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and QA set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLM performance remains poorly understood. In this paper, we argue that data scaling is not always the optimal principle for domain-specific benchmark construction. Instead, we introduce Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework grounded in the principle of comprehensiveness and compactness. Comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall by covering the full breadth of the domain, while compactness improves precision by reducing redundancy and noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a case study conducted at a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of PolyBench, a large-scale, high-quality academic benchmark. Although this study focuses on academia, the Comp-Comp framework is domain-agnostic and readily adaptable to a wide range of specialized fields.

  Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research, especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models. Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more insights into our methodologies.

  Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and available atthis https URL.

  As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise. The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO. These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our findings expose.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding, which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

  Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present \emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and \emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data. Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic industrial constraints. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex}, \textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However, existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.

  We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP), which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions. Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

  The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.
