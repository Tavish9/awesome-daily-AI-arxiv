- **[Diffusion-Based Imaginative Coordination for Bimanual Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11296)**  `arXiv:2507.11296`  `cs.RO`  
  _Huilin Xu, Jian Ding, Jiakun Xu, Ruixiang Wang, Jun Chen, Jinjie Mai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bimanual manipulation is crucial in robotics, enabling complex tasks in industrial automation and household services. However, it poses significant challenges due to the high-dimensional action space and intricate coordination requirements. While video prediction has been recently studied for representation learning and control, leveraging its ability to capture rich dynamic and behavioral information, its potential for enhancing bimanual coordination remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework for the joint optimization of video and action prediction. Specifically, we propose a multi-frame latent prediction strategy that encodes future states in a compressed latent space, preserving task-relevant features. Furthermore, we introduce a unidirectional attention mechanism where video prediction is conditioned on the action, while action prediction remains independent of video prediction. This design allows us to omit video prediction during inference, significantly enhancing efficiency. Experiments on two simulated benchmarks and a real-world setting demonstrate a significant improvement in the success rate over the strong baseline ACT using our method, achieving a \textbf{24.9\%} increase on ALOHA, an \textbf{11.1\%} increase on RoboTwin, and a \textbf{32.5\%} increase in real-world experiments. Our models and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available atthis https URL.

- **[Sim2Real Diffusion: Learning Cross-Domain Adaptive Representations for Transferable Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00236)**  `arXiv:2507.00236`  `cs.RO`  
  _Chinmay Vilas Samak, Tanmay Vilas Samak, Bing Li, Venkat Krovi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation-based design, optimization, and validation of autonomous driving algorithms have proven to be crucial for their improvement over the years. Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real transfer methods struggle to address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive representations through conditional latent diffusion for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms. Our framework offers options to leverage: (i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and (iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze the presented framework and report our findings in terms of performance benchmarks and ablation studies, with critical quantitative metrics as well as insightful qualitative examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of sim2real diffusion for autonomous driving using a behavioral cloning case study. Our experiments indicate that the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by over 40%, which highlights the potential of diffusion models in sim2real transfer.

- **[RA-DP: Rapid Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Training-Free High-frequency Robotics Replanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04051)**  `arXiv:2503.04051`  `cs.RO`  
  _Xi Ye, Rui Heng Yang, Jun Jin, Yinchuan Li, Amir Rasouli_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models exhibit impressive scalability in robotic task learning, yet they struggle to adapt to novel, highly dynamic environments. This limitation primarily stems from their constrained replanning ability: they either operate at a low frequency due to a time-consuming iterative sampling process, or are unable to adapt to unforeseen feedback in case of rapid replanning. To address these challenges, we propose RA-DP, a novel diffusion policy framework with training-free high-frequency replanning ability that solves the above limitations in adapting to unforeseen dynamic environments. Specifically, our method integrates guidance signals which are often easily obtained in the new environment during the diffusion sampling process, and utilizes a novel action queue mechanism to generate replanned actions at every denoising step without retraining, thus forming a complete training-free framework for robot motion adaptation in unseen environments. Extensive evaluations have been conducted in both well-recognized simulation benchmarks and real robot tasks. Results show that RA-DP outperforms the state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in terms of replanning frequency and success rate. Moreover, we show that our framework is theoretically compatible with any training-free guidance signal.

- **[BMDetect: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Comprehensive Biomedical Misconduct Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05763)**  `arXiv:2505.05763`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yize Zhou, Jie Zhang, Meijie Wang, Lun Yu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Academic misconduct detection in biomedical research remains challenging due to algorithmic narrowness in existing methods and fragmented analytical pipelines. We present BMDetect, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates journal metadata (SJR, institutional data), semantic embeddings (PubMedBERT), and GPT-4o-mined textual attributes (methodological statistics, data anomalies) for holistic manuscript evaluation. Key innovations include: (1) multimodal fusion of domain-specific features to reduce detection bias; (2) quantitative evaluation of feature importance, identifying journal authority metrics (e.g., SJR-index) and textual anomalies (e.g., statistical outliers) as dominant predictors; and (3) the BioMCD dataset, a large-scale benchmark with 13,160 retracted articles and 53,411 controls. BMDetect achieves 74.33% AUC, outperforming single-modality baselines by 8.6%, and demonstrates transferability across biomedical subfields. This work advances scalable, interpretable tools for safeguarding research integrity.

- **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Wasserstein Regularization via Optimal Transport Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10843)**  `arXiv:2507.10843`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Motoki Omura, Yusuke Mukuta, Kazuki Ota, Takayuki Osa, Tatsuya Harada_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the $f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL benchmark dataset. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[A Simple Baseline for Stable and Plastic Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10637)**  `arXiv:2507.10637`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _√â. K√ºnzel, A. Jaziri, V. Ramesh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a continuous stream of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, yet existing approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability. We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be measured.

- **[First-Order Error Matters: Accurate Compensation for Quantized Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11017)**  `arXiv:2507.11017`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Xingyu Zheng, Haotong Qin, Yuye Li, Jiakai Wang, Jinyang Guo, Michele Magno, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from 51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%. Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

- **[Semantic Context for Tool Orchestration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10820)**  `arXiv:2507.10820`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Robert M√ºller_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper demonstrates that Semantic Context (SC), leveraging descriptive tool information, is a foundational component for robust tool orchestration. Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a theoretical foundation using contextual bandits, introducing SC-LinUCB and proving it achieves lower regret and adapts favourably in dynamic action spaces. Second, we provide parallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is critical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning) and non-stationary (robust adaptation) settings. Third, we propose the FiReAct pipeline, and demonstrate on a benchmark with over 10,000 tools that SC-based retrieval enables an LLM to effectively orchestrate over a large action space. These findings provide a comprehensive guide to building more sample-efficient, adaptive, and scalable orchestration agents.

- **[GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628)**  `arXiv:2507.10628`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

- **[Extension OL-MDISF: Online Learning from Mix-Typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10594)**  `arXiv:2507.10594`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shengda Zhuo, Di Wu, Yi He, Shuqiang Huang, Xindong Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware pseudo-labeling.This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF. It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling, drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.

- **[FeDa4Fair: Client-Level Federated Datasets for Fairness Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21095)**  `arXiv:2506.21095`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xenia Heilmann, Luca Corbucci, Mattia Cerrato, Anna Monreale_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways: (1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

- **[The Price of Freedom: Exploring Expressivity and Runtime Tradeoffs in Equivariant Tensor Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13523)**  `arXiv:2506.13523`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _YuQing Xie, Ameya Daigavane, Mit Kotak, Tess Smidt_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Rethinking the Foundations for Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08161)**  `arXiv:2504.08161`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Esraa Elelimy, David Szepesvari, Martha White, Michael Bowling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the traditional view of reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes its expected sum of rewards. Once the agent finds this policy, the learning ends. This view contrasts with \emph{continual reinforcement learning}, where learning does not end, and agents are expected to continually learn and adapt indefinitely. Despite the clear distinction between these two paradigms of learning, much of the progress in continual reinforcement learning has been shaped by foundations rooted in the traditional view of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first examine whether the foundations of traditional reinforcement learning are suitable for the continual reinforcement learning paradigm. We identify four key pillars of the traditional reinforcement learning foundations that are antithetical to the goals of continual learning: the Markov decision process formalism, the focus on atemporal artifacts, the expected sum of rewards as an evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. We then propose a new formalism that sheds the first and the third foundations and replaces them with the history process as a mathematical formalism and a new definition of deviation regret, adapted for continual learning, as an evaluation metric. Finally, we discuss possible approaches to shed the other two foundations.

- **[Compositional Flows for 3D Molecule and Synthesis Pathway Co-design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08051)**  `arXiv:2504.08051`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tony Shen, Seonghwan Seo, Ross Irwin, Kieran Didi, Simon Olsson, Woo Youn Kim, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many generative applications, such as synthesis-based 3D molecular design, involve constructing compositional objects with continuous features. Here, we introduce Compositional Generative Flows (CGFlow), a novel framework that extends flow matching to generate objects in compositional steps while modeling continuous states. Our key insight is that modeling compositional state transitions can be formulated as a straightforward extension of the flow matching interpolation process. We further build upon the theoretical foundations of generative flow networks (GFlowNets), enabling reward-guided sampling of compositional structures. We apply CGFlow to synthesizable drug design by jointly designing the molecule's synthetic pathway with its 3D binding pose. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity on all 15 targets from the LIT-PCBA benchmark, and 5.8$\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared to 2D synthesis-based baseline. To our best knowledge, our method is also the first to achieve state of-art-performance in both Vina Dock (-9.38) and AiZynth success rate (62.2\%) on the CrossDocked benchmark.

- **[Multi-View Node Pruning for Accurate Graph Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11737)**  `arXiv:2503.11737`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jiseong Park, Hanjin Kim, Seojin Kim, Jueun Choi, Doheon Lee, Sung Ju Hwang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph, is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge.

  Many physical processes can be expressed through partial differential equations (PDEs). Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements. The source code for our methodology and the three created datasets can be found onthis https URL.

- **[Searching Latent Program Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08706)**  `arXiv:2411.08706`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Matthew V Macfarlane, Cl√©ment Bonnet_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General intelligence requires systems that acquire new skills efficiently and generalize beyond their training distributions. Although program synthesis approaches have strong generalization power, they face scaling issues due to large combinatorial spaces that quickly make them impractical and require human-generated DSLs or pre-trained priors to narrow this search space. On the other hand, deep learning methods have had high successes, but they lack structured test-time adaptation and rely on heavy stochastic sampling or expensive gradient updates for fine-tuning. In this work, we propose the Latent Program Network (LPN), a new architecture that builds in test-time search directly into neural models. LPN learns a latent space of implicit programs--neurally mapping inputs to outputs--through which it can search using gradients at test time. LPN combines the adaptability of symbolic approaches and the scalability of neural methods. It searches through a compact latent space at test time and bypasses the need for pre-defined domain-specific languages. On a range of programming-by-examples tasks, LPN either outperforms or matches performance compared to in-context learning and test-time training methods. Tested on the ARC-AGI benchmark, we demonstrate that LPN can both learn a compact program space and search through it at test time to adapt to novel tasks. LPN doubles its performance on out-of-distribution tasks when test-time search is switched on.

- **[ComFairGNN: Community Fair Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04371)**  `arXiv:2411.04371`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yonas Sium, Qi Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the leading approach for addressing graph analytical problems in various real-world scenarios. However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.

  A significant challenge in applying planning technology to real-world problems lies in obtaining a planning model that accurately represents the problem's dynamics. Obtaining a planning model is even more challenging in mission-critical domains, where a trial-and-error approach to learning how to act is not an option. In such domains, the action model used to generate plans must be safe, in the sense that plans generated with it must be applicable and achieve their goals. % Learning safe action models for planning has been mostly explored for domains in which states are sufficiently described with Boolean variables. % In this work, we go beyond this limitation and propose the Numeric Safe Action Models Learning (N-SAM) algorithm. In this work, we present N-SAM, an action model learning algorithm capable of learning safe numeric preconditions and effects. We prove that N-SAM runs in linear time in the number of observations and, under certain conditions, is guaranteed to return safe action models. However, to preserve this safety guarantee, N-SAM must observe a substantial number of examples for each action before including it in the learned model. We address this limitation of N-SAM and propose N-SAM*, an extension to the N-SAM algorithm that always returns an action model where every observed action is applicable at least in some states, even if it was observed only once. N-SAM* does so without compromising the safety of the returned action model. We prove that N-SAM* is optimal in terms of sample complexity compared to any other algorithm that guarantees safety. N-SAM and N-SAM* are evaluated over an extensive benchmark of numeric planning domains, and their performance is compared to a state-of-the-art numeric action model learning algorithm. We also provide a discussion on the impact of numerical accuracy on the learning process.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn to represent nodes by aggregating information from their neighbors. As GNNs increase in depth, their receptive field grows exponentially, leading to high memory costs. Several existing methods address this by sampling a small subset of nodes, scaling GNNs to much larger graphs. These methods are primarily evaluated on homophilous graphs, where neighboring nodes often share the same label. However, most of these methods rely on static heuristics that may not generalize across different graphs or tasks. We argue that the sampling method should be adaptive, adjusting to the complex structural properties of each graph. To this end, we introduce GRAPES, an adaptive sampling method that learns to identify the set of nodes crucial for training a GNN. GRAPES trains a second GNN to predict node sampling probabilities by optimizing the downstream task objective. We evaluate GRAPES on various node classification benchmarks, involving homophilous as well as heterophilous graphs. We demonstrate GRAPES' effectiveness in accuracy and scalability, particularly in multi-label heterophilous graphs. Unlike other sampling methods, GRAPES maintains high accuracy even with smaller sample sizes and, therefore, can scale to massive graphs. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems, primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB in challenging MTL environments.

  Learning new information without forgetting prior knowledge is central to human intelligence. In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic forgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain has distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and pattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture these complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization capabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage properties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally plausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST task, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to state-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting. Representational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the VAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By capturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work provides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation, generalization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial systems.

  Score-function policy gradients have delivered strong results in game-playing, robotics and language-model fine-tuning. Yet its high-variance often undermines training stability. On the other hand, pathwise policy gradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by an accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to train without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to construct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training Q-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to balance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that facilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we propose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient on-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard on-policy learning. We demonstrate that REPPO provides strong empirical performance at decreased sample requirements, wall-clock time, memory footprint as well as high hyperparameter robustness in a set of experiments on two standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks.

  While large language models (LLMs) excel at text generation, aligning them with human preferences remains challenging. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) improves alignment but is costly and unstable. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a simpler alternative, yet assumes a fixed, single-dimensional preference. We propose Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, a generalization of DPO that supports multiple preference dimensions and dynamic interpolation via a simplex-weighted lambda vector. Our method enables listwise supervision and flexible alignment without re-training. While our experiments are conducted on 1B-2B scale models, this is an intentional choice: smaller models provide a more stringent testbed where performance improvements more clearly reflect the effectiveness of the alignment strategy itself. Moreover, such models are widely used in compute-constrained applications, making our improvements both methodologically meaningful and practically valuable. Empirical results show that our approach matches or surpasses standard DPO on alignment benchmarks while offering improved adaptability.

  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and code are available atthis https URL.

  Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets, these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model. It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks enables synergistic learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various tasks, but their large storage and computational requirements constrain their deployment on edge devices. To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct, demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30\%$ storage reduction compared to uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further show that our method enables $31.9\%$ - $146.6\%$ faster inference throughput on memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time-series forecasting has gained significant attention in machine learning due to its crucial role in various domains. However, most existing forecasting models rely heavily on point-wise loss functions like Mean Square Error, which treat each time step independently and neglect the structural dependencies inherent in time series data, making it challenging to capture complex temporal patterns accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Patch-wise Structural (PS) loss, designed to enhance structural alignment by comparing time series at the patch level. Through leveraging local statistical properties, such as correlation, variance, and mean, PS loss captures nuanced structural discrepancies overlooked by traditional point-wise losses. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with point-wise loss, simultaneously addressing local structural inconsistencies and individual time-step errors. PS loss establishes a novel benchmark for accurately modeling complex time series data and provides a new perspective on time series loss function design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PS loss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.

  Vision AutoRegressive model (VAR) was recently introduced as an alternative to Diffusion Models (DMs) in image generation domain. In this work we focus on its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) often encounters incomplete multimodality in practical applications due to sensor failures or privacy protection requirements. While existing methods attempt to address various incomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality combination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical limitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict with each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction model. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank adaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a novel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal learning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination aware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The MCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct characteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts the training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each modality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across different modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in multiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms previous incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.

  In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the extreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of human activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural resources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the extremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or highland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model which explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide events. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain free resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote sensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for two tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our proposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie, and Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23, 93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU scores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense, Nepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our proposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.

  Floorplans provide a compact representation of the building's structure, revealing not only layout information but also detailed semantics such as the locations of windows and doors. However, contemporary floorplan localization techniques mostly focus on matching depth-based structural cues, ignoring the rich semantics communicated within floorplans. In this work, we introduce a semantic-aware localization framework that jointly estimates depth and semantic rays, consolidating over both for predicting a structural-semantic probability volume. Our probability volume is constructed in a coarse-to-fine manner: We first sample a small set of rays to obtain an initial low-resolution probability volume. We then refine these probabilities by performing a denser sampling only in high-probability regions and process the refined values for predicting a 2D location and orientation angle. We conduct an evaluation on two standard floorplan localization benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in recall metrics compared to prior works. Moreover, we show that our framework can easily incorporate additional metadata such as room labels, enabling additional gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

  Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

  Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation spaces of these uni-modal models towards a multi-modal objective. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of searching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\times$, while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

  The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular, on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M parameters. The code is publicly available at [this https URL].

  Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at [this https URL].

  PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present. To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa, enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$ faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets, showing its robustness across different conditions.

  Unified multimodal generative models aim to integrate image understanding and generation abilities, offering significant advantages in harnessing multimodal corpora, particularly interleaved text-image data. However, existing unified models exhibit limitations in image synthesis quality, autoregressive error accumulation, and image editing capability. In this work, we propose Nexus-Gen, a novel architecture that unifies image understanding, generation, and editing tasks in a shared image embedding space. This shared space serves as a bridge for the autoregressive and diffusion models, which seamlessly integrates their complementary strengths in cross-modal modeling. To mitigate the severe error accumulation during autoregressive embedding prediction, we propose a novel prefilled autoregression strategy that aligns training-inference dynamics by prefilling input sequences with learnable embeddings. After multi-stage and multi-task training on our constructed large-scale dataset with 26.3 million samples, Nexus-Gen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation benchmarks spanning image understanding, generation and editing tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the fundamental computer vision challenge of robust circle detection and fitting in degraded imaging conditions. We present Combinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an algorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric fitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling and (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world medical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos), (2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks, and (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier contamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3 fps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a standard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost 1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher than 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989 across contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al. (2024, 0.991), and surpassing RHT (0.964). This combination of accuracy, speed, and robustness makes 3C-FBI ideal for medical imaging, robotics, and industrial inspection under challenging conditions.

  Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric, overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight, capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets, UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities, featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods aim to predict depth maps for a sequence of calibrated images to recover dense point clouds. However, existing MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as textureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In contrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature matching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these regions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature and depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular foundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of the reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention mechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the monocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the depth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a relative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to supervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and Tanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate and Advanced benchmarks.

  In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR), which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the 3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages: i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$ is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.

  With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale corpora excel at natural image tasks and are increasingly repurposed for healthcare; however, their competence in medical tasks remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive evaluation of open-source general-purpose and medically specialised VLMs, ranging from 3B to 72B parameters, across eight benchmarks: MedXpert, OmniMedVQA, PMC-VQA, PathVQA, MMMU, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD. To observe model performance across different aspects, we first separate it into understanding and reasoning components. Three salient findings emerge. First, large general-purpose models already match or surpass medical-specific counterparts on several benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer from natural to medical images. Second, reasoning performance is consistently lower than understanding, highlighting a critical barrier to safe decision support. Third, performance varies widely across benchmarks, reflecting differences in task design, annotation quality, and knowledge demands. No model yet reaches the reliability threshold for clinical deployment, underscoring the need for stronger multimodal alignment and more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation protocols.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID) tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation (DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2) Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PRCC and LTCC datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized image understanding by bridging textual and visual modalities. However, these models often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as the precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as structure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects, particularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as fine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In this paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that specifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the integration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By unifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself as an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The model is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first interprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise positions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push the boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over 500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles, and scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++ to unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization. Comprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified solution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative implications for human-AI interaction.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Atmospheric structure, represented by backscatter coefficients (BC) recovered from satellite LiDAR attenuated backscatter (ATB), provides a volumetric view of clouds, aerosols, and molecules, playing a critical role in human activities, climate understanding, and extreme weather forecasting. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary inputs and simplified physics-based approximations, and lack a standardized 3D benchmark for fair evaluation. However, such approaches may introduce additional uncertainties and insufficiently capture realistic radiative transfer and atmospheric scattering-absorption effects. To bridge these gaps, we present Atmos-Bench: the first 3D atmospheric benchmark, along with a novel FourCastX: Frequency-enhanced Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts Network that (a) generates 921,600 image slices from 3D scattering volumes simulated at 532 nm and 355 nm by coupling WRF with an enhanced COSP simulator over 384 land-ocean time steps, yielding high-quality voxel-wise references; (b) embeds ATB-BC physical constraints into the model architecture, promoting energy consistency during restoration; (c) achieves consistent improvements on the Atmos-Bench dataset across both 355 nm and 532 nm bands, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models without relying on auxiliary inputs. Atmos-Bench establishes a new standard for satellite-based 3D atmospheric structure recovery and paves the way for deeper climate insight.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for advancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate surface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is inherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations. Thus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of high-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait. Different from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or lower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of the ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address this, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46 subjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a complete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth) along with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views. This structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud completion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset is designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of state-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and multi-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the challenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D has significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment foot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis, prosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of the foot during motion.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) can segment an image into semantic regions based on arbitrarily given text descriptions even for classes unseen during training, it fails to understand personal texts (e.g., `my mug cup') for segmenting regions of specific interest to users. This paper addresses challenges like recognizing `my mug cup' among `multiple mug cups'. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel task termed \textit{personalized open-vocabulary semantic segmentation} and propose a text prompt tuning-based plug-in method designed to recognize personal visual concepts using a few pairs of images and masks, while maintaining the performance of the original OVSS. Based on the observation that reducing false predictions is essential when applying text prompt tuning to this task, our proposed method employs `negative mask proposal' that captures visual concepts other than the personalized concept. We further improve the performance by enriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of the personal concept into them. This approach enhances personalized OVSS without compromising the original OVSS performance. We demonstrate the superiority of our method on our newly established benchmarks for this task, including FSS$^\text{per}$, CUB$^\text{per}$, and ADE$^\text{per}$.

  With the advent of vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) in zero- and few-shot settings, CLIP has been widely applied to zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) in recent research, where the rare classes are essential and expected in many applications. This study introduces \textbf{FiSeCLIP} for ZSAD with training-free \textbf{CLIP}, combining the feature matching with the cross-modal alignment. Testing with the entire dataset is impractical, while batch-based testing better aligns with real industrial needs, and images within a batch can serve as mutual reference points. Accordingly, FiSeCLIP utilizes other images in the same batch as reference information for the current image. However, the lack of labels for these references can introduce ambiguity, we apply text information to \textbf{fi}lter out noisy features. In addition, we further explore CLIP's inherent potential to restore its local \textbf{se}mantic correlation, adapting it for fine-grained anomaly detection tasks to enable a more accurate filtering process. Our approach exhibits superior performance for both anomaly classification and segmentation on anomaly detection benchmarks, building a stronger baseline for the direction, e.g., on MVTec-AD, FiSeCLIP outperforms the SOTA AdaCLIP by +4.6\%$\uparrow$/+5.7\%$\uparrow$ in segmentation metrics AU-ROC/$F_1$-max.

  With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI) technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  With the growing research focus on multimodal dialogue systems, the capability for proactive interaction is gradually gaining recognition. As an alternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect multimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously determining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video playback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce ProactiveVideoQA, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's ability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated at varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts for the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate evaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive benchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveVideoQA and a user study of human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human preferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider the textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides a more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction scenarios. Project homepage:this https URL

  Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps, which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles.

Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer, as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological correspondences.

  Advances in vision-based sensors and computer vision algorithms have significantly improved the analysis and understanding of traffic scenarios. To facilitate the use of these improvements for road safety, this survey systematically categorizes the critical elements that demand attention in traffic scenarios and comprehensively analyzes available vision-driven tasks and datasets. Compared to existing surveys that focus on isolated domains, our taxonomy categorizes attention-worthy traffic entities into two main groups that are anomalies and normal but critical entities, integrating ten categories and twenty subclasses. It establishes connections between inherently related fields and provides a unified analytical framework. Our survey highlights the analysis of 35 vision-driven tasks and comprehensive examinations and visualizations of 73 available datasets based on the proposed taxonomy. The cross-domain investigation covers the pros and cons of each benchmark with the aim of providing information on standards unification and resource optimization. Our article concludes with a systematic discussion of the existing weaknesses, underlining the potential effects and promising solutions from various perspectives. The integrated taxonomy, comprehensive analysis, and recapitulatory tables serve as valuable contributions to this rapidly evolving field by providing researchers with a holistic overview, guiding strategic resource selection, and highlighting critical research gaps.

  _Quang-Huy Che, Vinh-Tiep Nguyen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects from arbitrary text categories without requiring densely annotated datasets. Although contrastive learning based models enable zero-shot segmentation, they often lose fine spatial precision at pixel level, due to global representation bias. In contrast, diffusion-based models naturally encode fine-grained spatial features via attention mechanisms that capture both global context and local details. However, they often face challenges in balancing the computation costs and the quality of the segmentation mask. In this work, we present FA-Seg, a Fast and Accurate training-free framework for open-vocabulary segmentation based on diffusion models. FA-Seg performs segmentation using only a (1+1)-step from a pretrained diffusion model. Moreover, instead of running multiple times for different classes, FA-Seg performs segmentation for all classes at once. To further enhance the segmentation quality, FA-Seg introduces three key components: (i) a dual-prompt mechanism for discriminative, class-aware attention extraction, (ii) a Hierarchical Attention Refinement Method (HARD) that enhances semantic precision via multi-resolution attention fusion, and (iii) a Test-Time Flipping (TTF) scheme designed to improve spatial consistency. Extensive experiments show that FA-Seg achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance, obtaining 43.8% average mIoU across PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object benchmarks while maintaining superior inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that FA-Seg provides a strong foundation for extendability, bridging the gap between segmentation quality and inference efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Crack detection on road surfaces is a critical measurement technology in the instrumentation domain, essential for ensuring infrastructure safety and transportation reliability. However, due to limited energy and low-resolution imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT) module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial 33\% reduction compared to baseline implementations. This work pioneers a transformative approach in instrumentation-based crack detection, offering a scalable, low-power solution for real-time, large-scale infrastructure monitoring in resource-constrained environments.

  Medical Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in medical data interpretation. However, these models frequently generate hallucinations contradicting source evidence, particularly due to inadequate localization reasoning. This work reveals a critical limitation in current medical LMMs: instead of analyzing relevant pathological regions, they often rely on linguistic patterns or attend to irrelevant image areas when responding to disease-related queries. To address this, we introduce HEAL-MedVQA (Hallucination Evaluation via Localization MedVQA), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs' localization abilities and hallucination robustness. HEAL-MedVQA features (i) two innovative evaluation protocols to assess visual and textual shortcut learning, and (ii) a dataset of 67K VQA pairs, with doctor-annotated anatomical segmentation masks for pathological regions. To improve visual reasoning, we propose the Localize-before-Answer (LobA) framework, which trains LMMs to localize target regions of interest and self-prompt to emphasize segmented pathological areas, generating grounded and reliable answers. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art biomedical LMMs on the challenging HEAL-MedVQA benchmark, advancing robustness in medical VQA.

  Pixel grounding, encompassing tasks such as Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), has garnered considerable attention due to its immense potential for bridging the gap between vision and language modalities. However, advancements in this domain are currently constrained by limitations inherent in existing datasets, including limited object categories, insufficient textual diversity, and a scarcity of high-quality annotations. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce GroundingSuite, which comprises: (1) an automated data annotation framework leveraging multiple Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents; (2) a large-scale training dataset encompassing 9.56 million diverse referring expressions and their corresponding segmentations; and (3) a meticulously curated evaluation benchmark consisting of 3,800 images. The GroundingSuite training dataset facilitates substantial performance improvements, enabling models trained on it to achieve state-of-the-art results. Specifically, a cIoU of 68.9 on gRefCOCO and a gIoU of 55.3 on RefCOCOm. Moreover, the GroundingSuite annotation framework demonstrates superior efficiency compared to the current leading data annotation method, i.e., $4.5 \times$ faster than GLaMM.

  Human pose, action, and motion generation are critical for applications in digital humans, character animation, and humanoid robotics. However, many existing methods struggle to produce physically plausible movements that are consistent with biomechanical principles. Although recent autoregressive and diffusion models deliver impressive visual quality, they often neglect key biodynamic features and fail to ensure physically realistic motions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches can address these shortcomings but are highly dependent on simulation environments, limiting their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we propose BioVAE, a biomechanics-aware framework with three core innovations: (1) integration of muscle electromyography (EMG) signals and kinematic features with acceleration constraints to enable physically plausible motion without simulations; (2) seamless coupling with diffusion models for stable end-to-end training; and (3) biomechanical priors that promote strong generalization across diverse motion generation and estimation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, bridging the gap between data-driven motion synthesis and biomechanical authenticity while setting new standards for physically accurate motion generation and pose estimation.

  The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing research interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time series (i.e., the query time series), ITSR methods search and retrieve from large archives the image time series that have similar content to the query time series. Existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval problems, relying on an assumption that users always have access to a query image time series in the considered image modality. In operational scenarios, this assumption may not hold. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we introduce the task of cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR). In detail, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-ITSR method that enables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and vice versa. We focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e., bitemporal images). Our text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1) modality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images and text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific projection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared embedding space. To effectively model the temporal information in the bitemporal images, we exploit two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion (GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective operators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that leverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant bitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal image).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based scene text recognition (STR) methods, e.g., SVTR, are widely employed in OCR applications, mainly due to their simple architecture, which only contains a visual model and a CTC-aligned linear classifier, and therefore fast inference. However, they generally exhibit worse accuracy than encoder-decoder-based methods (EDTRs) due to struggling with text irregularity and linguistic missing. To address these challenges, we propose SVTRv2, a CTC model endowed with the ability to handle text irregularities and model linguistic context. First, a multi-size resizing strategy is proposed to resize text instances to appropriate predefined sizes, effectively avoiding severe text distortion. Meanwhile, we introduce a feature rearrangement module to ensure that visual features accommodate the requirement of CTC, thus alleviating the alignment puzzle. Second, we propose a semantic guidance module. It integrates linguistic context into the visual features, allowing CTC model to leverage language information for accuracy improvement. This module can be omitted at the inference stage and would not increase the time cost. We extensively evaluate SVTRv2 in both standard and recent challenging benchmarks, where SVTRv2 is fairly compared to popular STR models across multiple scenarios, including different types of text irregularity, languages, long text, and whether employing pretraining. SVTRv2 surpasses most EDTRs across the scenarios in terms of accuracy and inference speed. Code:this https URL.

  Visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous regions in images through unsupervised learning paradigms, with increasing application demand and value in fields such as industrial inspection and medical lesion detection. Despite significant progress in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks to adequately evaluate the performance of various mainstream methods across different datasets under the practical multi-class setting. The absence of standardized experimental setups can lead to potential biases in training epochs, resolution, and metric results, resulting in erroneous conclusions. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a comprehensive visual anomaly detection benchmark, ADer, which is a modular framework that is highly extensible for new methods. The benchmark includes multiple datasets from industrial and medical domains, implementing fifteen state-of-the-art methods and nine comprehensive metrics. Additionally, we have proposed the GPU-assisted ADEval package to address the slow evaluation problem of metrics like time-consuming mAU-PRO on large-scale data, significantly reducing evaluation time by more than \textit{1000-fold}. Through extensive experimental results, we objectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and provide insights into the challenges and future directions of multi-class visual anomaly detection. We hope that ADer will become a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, promoting the development of more robust and generalizable anomaly detection systems.

  _Yechi Ma, Yanan Li, Wei Hua, Shu Kong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Roadside monocular 3D detection requires detecting objects of predefined classes in an RGB frame and predicting their 3D attributes, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) locations. It has broad applications in traffic control, vehicle-vehicle communication, and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. To address this task, we introduce Promptable 3D Detector (Pro3D), a novel detector design that leverages 2D detections as prompts. We build our Pro3D upon two key insights. First, compared to a typical 3D detector, a 2D detector is ``easier'' to train due to fewer loss terms and performs significantly better at localizing objects w.r.t 2D metrics. Second, once 2D detections precisely locate objects in the image, a 3D detector can focus on lifting these detections into 3D BEV, especially when fixed camera pose or scene geometry provide an informative prior. To encode and incorporate 2D detections, we explore three methods: (a) concatenating features from both 2D and 3D detectors, (b) attentively fusing 2D and 3D detector features, and (c) encoding properties of predicted 2D bounding boxes \{$x$, $y$, width, height, label\} and attentively fusing them with the 3D detector feature. Interestingly, the third method significantly outperforms the others, underscoring the effectiveness of 2D detections as prompts that offer precise object targets and allow the 3D detector to focus on lifting them into 3D. Pro3D is adaptable for use with a wide range of 2D and 3D detectors with minimal modifications. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Pro3D significantly enhances existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on two contemporary benchmarks.

  This paper proposes an atomic behaviour intervention strategy using the Pavlok wearable device. Pavlok utilises beeps, vibration and shocks as a mode of aversion technique to help individuals with behaviour modification. While the device can be useful in certain periodic daily life situations, like alarms and exercise notifications, it relies on manual operations that limit its usage. To automate behaviour modification, we propose a framework that first detects targeted behaviours through a lightweight deep learning model and subsequently nudges the user. Our proposed solution is implemented and verified in the context of snoring, which captures audio from the environment following a prediction of whether the audio content is a snore or not using a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network. Based on the prediction, we use Pavlok to nudge users for preventive measures, such as a change in sleeping posture. We believe that this simple solution can help people change their atomic habits, which may lead to long-term health benefits. Our proposed lightweight model (99.8% fewer parameters over SOTA; 790,273$\rightarrow$1,337) achieves SOTA test accuracy of 0.99 on a public benchmark.

MISS-QA comprises 1,500 expert-annotated examples over 465 scientific papers. In this benchmark, models are tasked with interpreting schematic diagrams that illustrate research overviews and answering corresponding information-seeking questions based on the broader context of the paper. We assess the performance of 18 frontier multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen2.5-VL. We reveal a significant performance gap between these models and human experts on MISS-QA. Our analysis of model performance on unanswerable questions and our detailed error analysis further highlight the strengths and limitations of current models, offering key insights to enhance models in comprehending multimodal scientific literature.

  Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss, and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our code is open-sourced atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts. By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia, with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods (Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models (decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine- from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

  The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

  _Seungho Choi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT) framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja (Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with no additional run-time cost.

  Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.

  Retrieval systems are central to many NLP pipelines, but often rely on surface-level cues such as keyword overlap and lexical semantic similarity. To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present ImpliRet, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving "two days ago"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships. We evaluate a range of sparse and dense retrievers, all of which struggle in this setting: the best nDCG@10 is only 14.91%. We also test whether long-context models can overcome this limitation. But even with a short context of only thirty documents, including the positive document, GPT-o4-mini scores only 55.54%, showing that document-side reasoning remains a challenge.

  Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts. FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges. Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety or general language capabilities.

We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as a handcrafted planner and Oracle Retriever, to ablate the different components of a modern agent architecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of examples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge that requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether they are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and compare their performance and efficiency to a handcrafted planner. Overall, we find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about benchmark data contamination (BDC), where models inadvertently memorize evaluation data, inflating performance metrics and undermining genuine generalization assessment. This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk (DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and quantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and label. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR produces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect contamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the DCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy adjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three benchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational efficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating contamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons and enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices.

  Efficient and accurate autoformalization methods, which leverage large-scale datasets of extensive natural language mathematical problems to construct formal language datasets, are key to advancing formal mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we propose an autoformalization pipeline based on large language models with error feedback, achieving a fully automatic and training-free formalization approach. Using this pipeline, we curate an Olympiad-level dataset aligning natural language problems with Lean formalizations. The dataset comprises $3,922$ mathematical problems in natural language and $9,787$ in Lean, of which $64.46\%$ were assessed as at least above-average quality, making it suitable as a benchmark for automated theorem provers. Additionally, we investigate the formalization and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs and empirically demonstrate that few-shot learning, error feedback, and increasing sampling numbers enhance the autoformalization process. Experiments of three automated theorem provers on the \dataset\ dataset also highlight its challenging nature and its value as a benchmark for formal reasoning tasks.

  Previous literature has largely shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) perpetuate social biases learnt from their pre-training data. Given the notable lack of resources for social bias evaluation in languages other than English, and for social contexts outside of the United States, this paper introduces the Spanish and the Catalan Bias Benchmarks for Question Answering (EsBBQ and CaBBQ). Based on the original BBQ, these two parallel datasets are designed to assess social bias across 10 categories using a multiple-choice QA setting, now adapted to the Spanish and Catalan languages and to the social context of Spain. We report evaluation results on different LLMs, factoring in model family, size and variant. Our results show that models tend to fail to choose the correct answer in ambiguous scenarios, and that high QA accuracy often correlates with greater reliance on social biases.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling. However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

  This Working Note summarizes the participation of the DS@GT team in two eRisk 2025 challenges. For the Pilot Task on conversational depression detection with large language-models (LLMs), we adopted a prompt-engineering strategy in which diverse LLMs conducted BDI-II-based assessments and produced structured JSON outputs. Because ground-truth labels were unavailable, we evaluated cross-model agreement and internal consistency. Our prompt design methodology aligned model outputs with BDI-II criteria and enabled the analysis of conversational cues that influenced the prediction of symptoms. Our best submission, second on the official leaderboard, achieved DCHR = 0.50, ADODL = 0.89, and ASHR = 0.27.

  Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on task-specific benchmarks, yet their evaluation methods remain constrained by isolated problem-solving paradigms. Existing benchmarks predominantly assess single-question reasoning through sequential testing, resulting critical limitations: (1) vulnerability to data contamination and less challenging (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 achieves 97.0% on MATH500), forcing costly creation of new questions with large human efforts, (2) failure to evaluate models under multi-context pressure, a key requirement for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we present REST (Reasoning Evaluation through Simultaneous Testing), a stress-testing framework that exposes LRMs to multiple problems simultaneously. Beyond basic reasoning, REST evaluates several under-tested capabilities: contextual priority allocation, cross-problem interference resistance, and dynamic cognitive load management. Our evaluation reveals several striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially, REST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks, revealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar, near-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key insights emerge from our analysis: (1) the "overthinking trap" is a critical factor contributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with "long2short" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem performance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These results establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm that better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on continuous human annotation.

  We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks, where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity. Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

  Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.

  Most language models face a fundamental tradeoff where powerful capabilities require substantial computational resources. We shatter this constraint with Jan-nano, a 4B parameter language model that redefines efficiency through radical specialization: instead of trying to know everything, it masters the art of finding anything instantly. Fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B using our novel multi-stage Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) system that completely eliminates reliance on next token prediction training (SFT), Jan-nano achieves 83.2% on SimpleQA benchmark with MCP integration while running on consumer hardware. With 128K context length, Jan-nano proves that intelligence isn't about scale, it's about strategy.

  Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

  The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation, existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM, a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis.

  Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github:this https URL

  Large vision language models (LVLMs) have improved the document understanding capabilities remarkably, enabling the handling of complex document elements, longer contexts, and a wider range of tasks. However, existing document understanding benchmarks have been limited to handling only a small number of pages and fail to provide a comprehensive analysis of layout elements locating. In this paper, we first define three primary task categories: Long Document Understanding, numerical Reasoning, and cross-element Locating, and then propose a comprehensive benchmark, LongDocURL, integrating above three primary tasks and comprising 20 sub-tasks categorized based on different primary tasks and answer evidences. Furthermore, we develop a semi-automated construction pipeline and collect 2,325 high-quality question-answering pairs, covering more than 33,000 pages of documents, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks. Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive evaluation experiments on both open-source and closed-source models across 26 different configurations, revealing critical performance gaps in this field.

  Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs. We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis atthis https URL.

  This paper introduces the Opus Prompt Intention Framework, designed to improve complex Workflow Generation with instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user queries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention Framework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries, interpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention Elicitation.

  Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents (Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5 percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience: an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000 concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model -- multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters -- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system integrity.

  Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug interactions.

  Real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a fundamental building block for many commercial applications of ML, including live captioning, dictation, meeting transcriptions, and medical scribes. Accuracy and latency are the most important factors when companies select a system to deploy. We present WhisperKit, an optimized on-device inference system for real-time ASR that significantly outperforms leading cloud-based systems. We benchmark against server-side systems that deploy a diverse set of models, including a frontier model (OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe), a proprietary model (Deepgram nova-3), and an open-source model (Fireworks large-v3-turbo).Our results show that WhisperKit matches the lowest latency at 0.46s while achieving the highest accuracy 2.2% WER. The optimizations behind the WhisperKit system are described in detail in this paper.

  Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning, but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

  Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

  Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks. These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic benchmarks have issues in task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation of agents' performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the performance overestimation by 33%.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating program code, opening exciting opportunities for applying program synthesis to games. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize usable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two programming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing algorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled by LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including five miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an environment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the framework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29 tasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLMs depends more on the task than on model size. While larger models generate more executable programs, these do not always result in higher-quality solutions but are much more expensive. No model has a clear advantage, although on any specific task, one model may be better. Trying many models on a problem and using the best results across them is more reliable than using just one.

  The fast growth of deep learning has brought great progress in AI-based applications. However, these models are often seen as "black boxes," which makes them hard to understand, explain, or trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to make AI decisions clearer so that people can understand how and why the model makes certain choices. Even though many studies have focused on XAI, there is still a lack of standard ways to measure how well these explanation methods work in real-world situations. This study introduces a single evaluation framework for XAI. It uses both numbers and user feedback to check if the explanations are correct, easy to understand, fair, complete, and reliable. The framework focuses on users' needs and different application areas, which helps improve the trust and use of AI in important fields. To fix problems in current evaluation methods, we propose clear steps, including loading data, creating explanations, and fully testing them. We also suggest setting common benchmarks. We show the value of this framework through case studies in healthcare, finance, farming, and self-driving systems. These examples prove that our method can support fair and trustworthy evaluation of XAI methods. This work gives a clear and practical way to improve transparency and trust in AI systems used in the real world.
