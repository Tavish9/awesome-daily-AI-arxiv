- **[Flow Matching Ergodic Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17872)**  `arXiv:2504.17872`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Max Muchen Sun, Allison Pinosky, Todd Murphey_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied agents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a target distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is measured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are constrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control synthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique widely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We formally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form solution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative inference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were previously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no computational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational gradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the target distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on the other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an optimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on non-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved performance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through comprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing and erasing tasks on a Franka robot.

- **[Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Guided Test-Time Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17355)**  `arXiv:2408.17355`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its effects on the learned policy remain inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity to unexpected states. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop adaptation. At each timestep, BID samples multiple candidate predictions and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes both long-term consistency and short-term reactivity. Experimental results show that our method boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks.

- **[Collaborating Action by Action: A Multi-agent LLM Framework for Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17950)**  `arXiv:2504.17950`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning.

- **[Towards Robust and Parameter-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621)**  `arXiv:2408.06621`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Sungmin Cha, Sungjun Cho, Dasol Hwang, Moontae Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact. Our implementation can be found inthis https URL.

- **[CaRL: Learning Scalable Planning Policies with Simple Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17838)**  `arXiv:2504.17838`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.

- **[Enhancing Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning through Neural Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18437)**  `arXiv:2504.18437`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs) have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated, equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning. Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by 6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.

- **[Efficient GNN Training Through Structure-Aware Randomized Mini-Batching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18082)**  `arXiv:2504.18082`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Vignesh Balaji, Christos Kozyrakis, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.

- **[Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Learning for Distributed Photovoltaic Disaggregation under Statistical Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18078)**  `arXiv:2504.18078`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xiaolu Chen, Chenghao Huang, Yanru Zhang, Hao Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide, many being behind-the-meter systems, has significantly challenged energy management and grid operations, as unobservable PV generation further complicates the supply-demand balance. Therefore, estimating this generation from net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns and the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a promising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical and behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV disaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed PV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning (PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation model is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing local PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting a portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global level, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data centers, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed framework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark methods.

- **[AMAD: AutoMasked Attention for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06643)**  `arXiv:2504.06643`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tiange Huang, Yongjun Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised multivariate time series anomaly detection (UMTSAD) plays a critical role in various domains, including finance, networks, and sensor systems. In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.

- **[Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06635)**  `arXiv:2503.06635`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus making all samples similar and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of "proximity to the pre-learned cluster center". With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.

- **[Local Control Networks (LCNs): Optimizing Flexibility in Neural Network Data Pattern Capture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14000)**  `arXiv:2501.14000`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hy Nguyen, Duy Khoa Pham, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread use of Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) often relies on a fixed activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) for all nodes within the hidden layers. While effective in many scenarios, this uniformity may limit the networks ability to capture complex data patterns. We argue that employing the same activation function at every node is suboptimal and propose leveraging different activation functions at each node to increase flexibility and adaptability. To achieve this, we introduce Local Control Networks (LCNs), which leverage B-spline functions to enable distinct activation curves at each node. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the properties and benefits of LCNs over conventional MLPs. In addition, we demonstrate that more complex architectures, such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), are unnecessary in certain scenarios, and LCNs can be a more efficient alternative. Empirical experiments on various benchmarks and datasets validate our theoretical findings. In computer vision tasks, LCNs achieve marginal improvements over MLPs and outperform KANs by approximately 5\%, while also being more computationally efficient than KANs. In basic machine learning tasks, LCNs show a 1\% improvement over MLPs and a 0.6\% improvement over KANs. For symbolic formula representation tasks, LCNs perform on par with KANs, with both architectures outperforming MLPs. Our findings suggest that diverse activations at the node level can lead to improved performance and efficiency.

- **[Dual-Branch HNSW Approach with Skip Bridges and LID-Driven Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13992)**  `arXiv:2501.13992`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Hy Nguyen, Nguyen Hung Nguyen, Nguyen Linh Bao Nguyen, Srikanth Thudumu, Hung Du, Rajesh Vasa, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm is widely used for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, leveraging the principles of navigable small-world graphs. However, it faces some limitations. The first is the local optima problem, which arises from the algorithm's greedy search strategy, selecting neighbors based solely on proximity at each step. This often leads to cluster disconnections. The second limitation is that HNSW frequently fails to achieve logarithmic complexity, particularly in high-dimensional datasets, due to the exhaustive traversal through each layer. To address these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that mitigates local optima and cluster disconnections while enhancing the construction speed, maintaining inference speed. The first component is a dual-branch HNSW structure with LID-based insertion mechanisms, enabling traversal from multiple directions. This improves outlier node capture, enhances cluster connectivity, accelerates construction speed and reduces the risk of local minima. The second component incorporates a bridge-building technique that bypasses redundant intermediate layers, maintaining inference and making up the additional computational overhead introduced by the dual-branch structure. Experiments on various benchmarks and datasets showed that our algorithm outperforms the original HNSW in both accuracy and speed. We evaluated six datasets across Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing recall improvements of 18\% in NLP, and up to 30\% in CV tasks while reducing the construction time by up to 20\% and maintaining the inference speed. We did not observe any trade-offs in our algorithm. Ablation studies revealed that LID-based insertion had the greatest impact on performance, followed by the dual-branch structure and bridge-building components.

- **[CR-LSO: Convex Neural Architecture Optimization in the Latent Space of Graph Variational Autoencoder with Input Convex Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05950)**  `arXiv:2211.05950`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xuan Rao, Bo Zhao, Derong Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In neural architecture search (NAS) methods based on latent space optimization (LSO), a deep generative model is trained to embed discrete neural architectures into a continuous latent space. In this case, different optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this problem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization (CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically, CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance. Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational complexity and architecture performance.

- **[A Generative Graph Contrastive Learning Model with Global Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18148)**  `arXiv:2504.18148`  `cs.LG`  
  _Xiaofan Wei, Binyan Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently since it learns complex structural information from graphs through self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely, they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL) with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines. Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.

- **[Tree Boosting Methods for Balanced andImbalanced Classification and their Robustness Over Time in Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18133)**  `arXiv:2504.18133`  `cs.LG`  
  _Gissel Velarde, Michael Weichert, Anuj Deshmunkh, Sanjay Deshmane, Anindya Sudhir, Khushboo Sharma, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most real-world classification problems deal with imbalanced datasets, posing a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., machine learning algorithms, because the minority class, which is of extreme interest, often proves difficult to be detected. This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting methods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions, from perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based methods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection performance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated. After introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine learning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary classifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree boosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is evaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on distributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the developed method increases its recognition performance as more data is given for training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more imbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of precision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and negatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent improvement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter optimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on data volume and distribution. Finally, the developed method is robust to data variation over time up to some point. Retraining can be used when performance starts deteriorating.

- **[Interpretable Affordance Detection on 3D Point Clouds with Probabilistic Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18355)**  `arXiv:2504.18355`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Maximilian Xiling Li, Korbinian Rudolf, Nils Blank, Rudolf Lioutikov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic agents need to understand how to interact with objects in their environment, both autonomously and during human-robot interactions. Affordance detection on 3D point clouds, which identifies object regions that allow specific interactions, has traditionally relied on deep learning models like PointNet++, DGCNN, or PointTransformerV3. However, these models operate as black boxes, offering no insight into their decision-making processes. Prototypical Learning methods, such as ProtoPNet, provide an interpretable alternative to black-box models by employing a "this looks like that" case-based reasoning approach. However, they have been primarily applied to image-based tasks. In this work, we apply prototypical learning to models for affordance detection on 3D point clouds. Experiments on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark dataset show that prototypical models achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art black-box models and offer inherent interpretability. This makes prototypical models a promising candidate for human-robot interaction scenarios that require increased trust and safety.

  _Andreas Ziegler, David Joseph, Thomas Gossard, Emil Moldovan, Andreas Zell_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors that detect light changes asynchronously for each pixel. They are increasingly used in fields like computer vision and robotics because of several advantages over traditional frame-based cameras, such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. As with any camera, the output's quality depends on how well the camera's settings, called biases for event-based cameras, are configured. While frame-based cameras have advanced automatic configuration algorithms, there are very few such tools for tuning these biases. A systematic testing framework would require observing the same scene with different biases, which is tricky since event cameras only generate events when there is movement. Event simulators exist, but since biases heavily depend on the electrical circuit and the pixel design, available simulators are not well suited for bias tuning. To allow reproducibility, we present BiasBench, a novel event dataset containing multiple scenes with settings sampled in a grid-like pattern. We present three different scenes, each with a quality metric of the downstream application. Additionally, we present a novel, RL-based method to facilitate online bias adjustments.

- **[RSRNav: Reasoning Spatial Relationship for Image-Goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17991)**  `arXiv:2504.17991`  `cs.CV` `cs.RO`  
  _Zheng Qin, Le Wang, Yabing Wang, Sanping Zhou, Gang Hua, Wei Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

  Assessing the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal AI systems can effectively measure their understanding and reasoning abilities. Most video evaluation benchmarks are limited to a single language, typically English, and predominantly feature videos rooted in Western cultural contexts. In this paper, we present VideoVista-CulturalLingo, the first video evaluation benchmark designed to bridge cultural, linguistic, and domain divide in video comprehension. Our work differs from existing benchmarks in the following ways: 1) Cultural diversity, incorporating cultures from China, North America, and Europe; 2) Multi-linguistics, with questions presented in Chinese and English-two of the most widely spoken languages; and 3) Broad domain, featuring videos sourced from hundreds of human-created domains. VideoVista-CulturalLingo contains 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs, and we have evaluated 24 recent open-source or proprietary video large models. From the experiment results, we observe that: 1) Existing models perform worse on Chinese-centric questions than Western-centric ones, particularly those related to Chinese history; 2) Current open-source models still exhibit limitations in temporal understanding, especially in the Event Localization task, achieving a maximum score of only 45.2%; 3) Mainstream models demonstrate strong performance in general scientific questions, while open-source models demonstrate weak performance in mathematics.

- **[M4U: Evaluating Multilingual Understanding and Reasoning for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15638)**  `arXiv:2405.15638`  `cs.CV` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual capability is an essential aspect for large multimodal models, since they are usually deployed across various countries and languages. However, most existing benchmarks for multilingual multimodal reasoning struggle to differentiate between models of varying performance; even language models without visual capabilities can easily achieve high scores. This leaves a comprehensive evaluation of leading multilingual multimodal models largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce M4U, a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing the capability of multi-discipline multilingual multimodal understanding and reasoning. M4U contains 10k samples covering 64 disciplines across 16 subfields in Science, Engineering, and Healthcare in six languages. Using M4U, we conduct extensive evaluations of leading Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools. The evaluation results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.6% average accuracy on M4U. Additionally, we observe that the leading LMMs exhibit significant language preferences. Our in-depth analysis indicates that leading LMMs, including GPT-4o, struggle to perform reasoning using multilingual information present in both visual and textual context.

  We present a new way to detect 3D objects from multimodal inputs, leveraging both LiDAR and RGB cameras in a hybrid late-cascade scheme, that combines an RGB detection network and a 3D LiDAR detector. We exploit late fusion principles to reduce LiDAR False Positives, matching LiDAR detections with RGB ones by projecting the LiDAR bounding boxes on the image. We rely on cascade fusion principles to recover LiDAR False Negatives leveraging epipolar constraints and frustums generated by RGB detections of separate views. Our solution can be plugged on top of any underlying single-modal detectors, enabling a flexible training process that can take advantage of pre-trained LiDAR and RGB detectors, or train the two branches separately. We evaluate our results on the KITTI object detection benchmark, showing significant performance improvements, especially for the detection of Pedestrians and Cyclists.

  The exponential growth of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has driven advancements in cross-modal reasoning but at significant computational costs. In this work, we focus on visual language models. We highlight the redundancy and inefficiency in current vision encoders, and seek to construct an adaptive compression method for multimodal data. In this work, we characterize a panoply of visual token selection and merging approaches through both benchmarking and qualitative analysis. In particular, we demonstrate that simple cluster-level token aggregation outperforms prior state-of-the-art works in token selection and merging, including merging at the vision encoder level and attention-based approaches. We underline the redundancy in current vision encoders, and shed light on several puzzling trends regarding principles of visual token selection through cross-modal attention visualizations. This work is a first effort towards more effective encoding and processing of high-dimensional data, and paves the way for more scalable and sustainable multimodal systems.

  Recent advancements in image manipulation have achieved unprecedented progress in generating photorealistic content, but also simultaneously eliminating barriers to arbitrary manipulation and editing, raising concerns about multimedia authenticity and cybersecurity. However, existing Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL) methodologies predominantly focus on splicing or copy-move forgeries, lacking dedicated benchmarks for inpainting-based manipulations. To bridge this gap, we present COCOInpaint, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for inpainting detection, with three key contributions: 1) High-quality inpainting samples generated by six state-of-the-art inpainting models, 2) Diverse generation scenarios enabled by four mask generation strategies with optional text guidance, and 3) Large-scale coverage with 258,266 inpainted images with rich semantic diversity. Our benchmark is constructed to emphasize intrinsic inconsistencies between inpainted and authentic regions, rather than superficial semantic artifacts such as object shapes. We establish a rigorous evaluation protocol using three standard metrics to assess existing IMDL approaches. The dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in this area.

  Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential for advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks.

  Widely shared videos on the internet are often edited. Recently, although Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding (VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19 fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable embodied agents to follow natural language instructions and reach target locations in real-world environments. While prior methods often rely on either global scene representations or object-level features, these approaches are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions across modalities required for accurate navigation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning Architecture (MFRA) to enhance the agent's ability to reason over visual observations, language instructions and navigation history. Specifically, MFRA introduces a hierarchical fusion mechanism that aggregates multi-level features-ranging from low-level visual cues to high-level semantic concepts-across multiple modalities. We further design a reasoning module that leverages fused representations to infer navigation actions through instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration. By selectively capturing and combining relevant visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA improves decision-making accuracy in complex navigation scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark VLN datasets including REVERIE, R2R, and SOON demonstrate that MFRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of multi-level modal fusion for embodied navigation.

  Recent advancements in text-to-video models such as Sora, Gen-3, MovieGen, and CogVideoX are pushing the boundaries of synthetic video generation, with adoption seen in fields like robotics, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations. Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models, the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly, indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a model's robustness against blur.

  LiDAR-based semantic segmentation is critical for autonomous trains, requiring accurate predictions across varying distances. This paper introduces two targeted data augmentation methods designed to improve segmentation performance on the railway-specific OSDaR23 dataset. The person instance pasting method enhances segmentation of pedestrians at distant ranges by injecting realistic variations into the dataset. The track sparsification method redistributes point density in LiDAR scans, improving track segmentation at far distances with minimal impact on close-range accuracy. Both methods are evaluated using a state-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation network, demonstrating significant improvements in distant-range performance while maintaining robustness in close-range predictions. We establish the first 3D semantic segmentation benchmark for OSDaR23, demonstrating the potential of data-centric approaches to address railway-specific challenges in autonomous train perception.

  As extended reality (XR) is redefining how users interact with computing devices, research in human action recognition is gaining prominence. Typically, models deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their default set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and developers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new action classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should be able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this process should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive training data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual action recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning. While existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual learning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to extensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET demonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight backbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel spatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to apply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new benchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU RGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand gesture recognition. We find that POET consistently outperforms comprehensive benchmarks. Source code atthis https URL.

  _Andrew Kiruluta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel spectral generative model for image synthesis that departs radically from the common variational, adversarial, and diffusion paradigms. In our approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are reconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis functions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency, phase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary with time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify the contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple probabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the deterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This framework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly interpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods relying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the incorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both global structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge information. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved training stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative model opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned spectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content of the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel applications in image manipulation and analysis.

  We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we introduce the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively counters the ``Vanishing Advantages'' dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we focus on scaling open-vocabulary action detection. Existing approaches for action detection are predominantly limited to closed-set scenarios and rely on complex, parameter-heavy architectures. Extending these models to the open-vocabulary setting poses two key challenges: (1) the lack of large-scale datasets with many action classes for robust training, and (2) parameter-heavy adaptations to a pretrained vision-language contrastive model to convert it for detection, risking overfitting the additional non-pretrained parameters to base action classes. Firstly, we introduce an encoder-only multimodal model for video action detection, reducing the reliance on parameter-heavy additions for video action detection. Secondly, we introduce a simple weakly supervised training strategy to exploit an existing closed-set action detection dataset for pretraining. Finally, we depart from the ill-posed base-to-novel benchmark used by prior works in open-vocabulary action detection and devise a new benchmark to evaluate on existing closed-set action detection datasets without ever using them for training, showing novel results to serve as baselines for future work.

  Generating speech-driven 3D talking heads presents numerous challenges; among those is dealing with varying mesh topologies where no point-wise correspondence exists across all meshes the model can animate. While simplifying the problem, it limits applicability as unseen meshes must adhere to the training topology. This work presents a framework capable of animating 3D faces in arbitrary topologies, including real scanned data. Our approach relies on a model leveraging heat diffusion to predict features robust to the mesh topology. We explore two training settings: a registered one, in which meshes in a training sequences share a fixed topology but any mesh can be animated at test time, and an fully unregistered one, which allows effective training with varying mesh structures. Additionally, we highlight the limitations of current evaluation metrics and propose new metrics for better lip-syncing evaluation between speech and facial movements. Our extensive evaluation shows our approach performs favorably compared to fixed topology techniques, setting a new benchmark by offering a versatile and high-fidelity solution for 3D talking head generation where the topology constraint is dropped.

  Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity. However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors, complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise editing while maintaining high quality.

  Geometric understanding - including depth and height perception - is fundamental to intelligence and crucial for navigating our environment. Despite the impressive capabilities of large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it remains unclear how well they possess the geometric understanding required for practical applications in visual perception. In this work, we focus on evaluating the geometric understanding of these models, specifically targeting their ability to perceive the depth and height of objects in an image. To address this, we introduce GeoMeter, a suite of benchmark datasets - encompassing 2D and 3D scenarios - to rigorously evaluate these aspects. By benchmarking 18 state-of-the-art VLMs, we found that although they excel in perceiving basic geometric properties like shape and size, they consistently struggle with depth and height perception. Our analysis reveal that these challenges stem from shortcomings in their depth and height reasoning capabilities and inherent biases. This study aims to pave the way for developing VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding by emphasizing depth and height perception as critical components necessary for real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating realistic and visually pleasing images grounded on textual prompts. Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains in applying these models for the more intricate task of story visualization. Since it requires resolving pronouns (he, she, they) in the frame descriptions, i.e., anaphora resolution, and ensuring consistent characters and background synthesis across frames. Yet, the emerging Large Language Model (LLM) showcases robust reasoning abilities to navigate through ambiguous references and process extensive sequences. Therefore, we introduce \emph{StoryGPT-V}, which leverages the merits of the latent diffusion (LDM) and LLM to produce images with consistent and high-quality characters grounded on given story descriptions. First, we train a character-aware LDM, which takes character-augmented semantic embedding as input and includes the supervision of the cross-attention map using character segmentation masks, aiming to enhance character generation accuracy and faithfulness. In the second stage, we enable an alignment between the output of LLM and the character-augmented embedding residing in the input space of the first-stage model. This harnesses the reasoning ability of LLM to address ambiguous references and the comprehension capability to memorize the context. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two visual story visualization benchmarks. Our model reports superior quantitative results and consistently generates accurate characters of remarkable quality with low memory consumption.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first, Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

  With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

  Mechanistic interpretability has made great strides in identifying neural network features (e.g., directions in hidden activation space) that mediate concepts(e.g., the birth year of a person) and enable predictable manipulation. Distributed alignment search (DAS) leverages supervision from counterfactual data to learn concept features within hidden states, but DAS assumes we can afford to conduct a brute force search over potential feature locations. To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.

  Ensuring faithfulness to context in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems is crucial for reliable deployment in real-world applications, as incorrect or unsupported information can erode user trust. Despite advancements on standard benchmarks, faithfulness hallucination-where models generate responses misaligned with the provided context-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce FaithEval, a novel and comprehensive benchmark tailored to evaluate the faithfulness of LLMs in contextual scenarios across three diverse tasks: unanswerable, inconsistent, and counterfactual contexts. These tasks simulate real-world challenges where retrieval mechanisms may surface incomplete, contradictory, or fabricated information. FaithEval comprises 4.9K high-quality problems in total, validated through a rigorous four-stage context construction and validation framework, employing both LLM-based auto-evaluation and human validation. Our extensive study across a wide range of open-source and proprietary models reveals that even state-of-the-art models often struggle to remain faithful to the given context, and that larger models do not necessarily exhibit improvedthis http URLis available at:this https URL.

  Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have revealed an \textit{overthinking} phenomenon, where models generate verbose reasoning across all tasks regardless of questions. To address this issue, we present \textbf{FAST}, a novel \textbf{Fa}st-\textbf{S}low \textbf{T}hinking framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics. Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect performance. We develop FAST-GRPO with three components: model-based metrics for question characterization, an adaptive thinking reward mechanism, and difficulty-aware KL regularization. Experiments across seven reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over 10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

  Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains. However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information -- remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

  This report analyzes the potential for large language models (LLMs) to expedite accurate replication and generalization of published research about message effects in marketing. LLM-powered participants (personas) were tested by replicating 133 experimental findings from 14 papers containing 45 recent studies published in the Journal of Marketing. For each study, the measures, stimuli, and sampling specifications were used to generate prompts for LLMs to act as unique personas. The AI personas, 19,447 in total across all of the studies, generated complete datasets and statistical analyses were then compared with the original human study results. The LLM replications successfully reproduced 76% of the original main effects (84 out of 111), demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted replication. The overall replication rate including interaction effects was 68% (90 out of 133). Furthermore, a test of how human results generalized to different participant samples, media stimuli, and measures showed that replication results can change when tests go beyond the parameters of the original human studies. Implications are discussed for the replication and generalizability crises in social science, the acceleration of theory building in media and marketing psychology, and the practical advantages of rapid message testing for consumer products. Limitations of AI replications are addressed with respect to complex interaction effects, biases in AI models, and establishing benchmarks for AI metrics in marketing research.

  In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30% accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance, especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

  High-resolution image (HRI) understanding aims to process images with a large number of pixels, such as pathological images and agricultural aerial images, both of which can exceed 1 million pixels. Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) can allegedly handle HRIs, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmark for VLMs to evaluate HRI understanding. To address this gap, we introduce HRScene, a novel unified benchmark for HRI understanding with rich scenes. HRScene incorporates 25 real-world datasets and 2 synthetic diagnostic datasets with resolutions ranging from 1,024 $\times$ 1,024 to 35,503 $\times$ 26,627. HRScene is collected and re-annotated by 10 graduate-level annotators, covering 25 scenarios, ranging from microscopic to radiology images, street views, long-range pictures, and telescope images. It includes HRIs of real-world objects, scanned documents, and composite multi-image. The two diagnostic evaluation datasets are synthesized by combining the target image with the gold answer and distracting images in different orders, assessing how well models utilize regions in HRI. We conduct extensive experiments involving 28 VLMs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o. Experiments on HRScene show that current VLMs achieve an average accuracy of around 50% on real-world tasks, revealing significant gaps in HRI understanding. Results on synthetic datasets reveal that VLMs struggle to effectively utilize HRI regions, showing significant Regional Divergence and lost-in-middle, shedding light on future research.

  In recent years, multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly. Despite this progress, there is still a notable absence of benchmark datasets specifically tailored to evaluate their performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Auto-SLURP, a benchmark dataset aimed at evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks in the context of intelligent personal assistants. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset -- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services. This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline, covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remain a work in progress.

  We introduce a new generation of small reasoning models for RAG, search, and source summarization. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks (HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.

  Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs, especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. We find that during DPO training, the reference model plays the role of a data weight adjuster. However, the common practice of initializing the policy and reference models identically in DPO can lead to inefficient data utilization and impose a performance ceiling. Meanwhile, the lack of a reference model in Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) reduces training robustness and necessitates stricter conditions to prevent catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose Pre-DPO, a simple yet effective DPO-based training paradigm that enhances preference optimization performance by leveraging a guiding reference model. This reference model provides foresight into the optimal policy state achievable through the training preference data, serving as a guiding mechanism that adaptively assigns higher weights to samples more suitable for the model and lower weights to those less suitable. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard v0.1 benchmarks demonstrate that Pre-DPO consistently improves the performance of both DPO and SimPO, without relying on external models or additional data.

  Recently, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to enhance the capability of large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice. Especially in the legal domain, previous judicial decisions play a significant role under the doctrine of stare decisis which emphasizes the importance of making decisions based on (retrieved) prior documents. However, the overall performance of RAG system depends on many components: (1) retrieval corpora, (2) retrieval algorithms, (3) rerankers, (4) LLM backbones, and (5) evaluation metrics. Here we propose LRAGE, an open-source tool for holistic evaluation of RAG systems focusing on the legal domain. LRAGE provides GUI and CLI interfaces to facilitate seamless experiments and investigate how changes in the aforementioned five components affect the overall accuracy. We validated LRAGE using multilingual legal benches including Korean (KBL), English (LegalBench), and Chinese (LawBench) by demonstrating how the overall accuracy changes when varying the five components mentioned above.

  This paper introduces PRobELM (Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models), a benchmark designed to assess language models' ability to discern more plausible from less plausible scenarios through their parametric knowledge. While benchmarks such as TruthfulQA emphasise factual accuracy or truthfulness, and others such as COPA explore plausible scenarios without explicitly incorporating world knowledge, PRobELM seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating models' capabilities to prioritise plausible scenarios that leverage world knowledge over less plausible alternatives. This design allows us to assess the potential of language models for downstream use cases such as literature-based discovery where the focus is on identifying information that is likely but not yet known. Our benchmark is constructed from a dataset curated from Wikidata edit histories, tailored to align the temporal bounds of the training data for the evaluated models. PRobELM facilitates the evaluation of language models across multiple prompting types, including statement, text completion, and question-answering. Experiments with 10 models of various sizes and architectures on the relationship between model scales, training recency, and plausibility performance, reveal that factual accuracy does not directly correlate with plausibility performance and that up-to-date training data enhances plausibility assessment across different model architectures.

  Drug discovery remains a formidable challenge: more than 90 percent of candidate molecules fail in clinical evaluation, and development costs often exceed one billion dollars per approved therapy. Disparate data streams, from genomics and transcriptomics to chemical libraries and clinical records, hinder coherent mechanistic insight and slow progress. Meanwhile, large language models excel at reasoning and tool integration but lack the modular specialization and iterative memory required for regulated, hypothesis-driven workflows. We introduce PharmaSwarm, a unified multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialized LLM "agents" to propose, validate, and refine hypotheses for novel drug targets and lead compounds. Each agent accesses dedicated functionality--automated genomic and expression analysis; a curated biomedical knowledge graph; pathway enrichment and network simulation; interpretable binding affinity prediction--while a central Evaluator LLM continuously ranks proposals by biological plausibility, novelty, in silico efficacy, and safety. A shared memory layer captures validated insights and fine-tunes underlying submodels over time, yielding a self-improving system. Deployable on low-code platforms or Kubernetes-based microservices, PharmaSwarm supports literature-driven discovery, omics-guided target identification, and market-informed repurposing. We also describe a rigorous four-tier validation pipeline spanning retrospective benchmarking, independent computational assays, experimental testing, and expert user studies to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and real-world impact. By acting as an AI copilot, PharmaSwarm can accelerate translational research and deliver high-confidence hypotheses more efficiently than traditional pipelines.

  Achieving human-level intelligence requires refining the transition from the fast, intuitive System 1 to the slower, more deliberate System 2 reasoning. While System 1 excels in quick, heuristic decisions, System 2 relies on logical reasoning for more accurate judgments and reduced biases. Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \href{this https URL}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and drive progress in this rapidly evolving field.
