- **[Experimental Setup and Software Pipeline to Evaluate Optimization based Autonomous Multi-Robot Search Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16710)**  `arXiv:2506.16710`  `cs.RO` `cs.MA`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot systems domain given its applications in search \& rescue and hazard localization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks) operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization (called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.

- **[Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799)**  `arXiv:2506.15799`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL. Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL): adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement. Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks, and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

- **[From Experts to a Generalist: Toward General Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12779)**  `arXiv:2506.12779`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

- **[ReinFlow: Fine-tuning Flow Matching Policy with Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094)**  `arXiv:2505.22094`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Tonghe Zhang, Chao Yu, Sichang Su, Yu Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

- **[Dex1B: Learning with 1B Demonstrations for Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17198)**  `arXiv:2506.17198`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains challenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this. Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is atthis https URL

- **[FlowRAM: Grounding Flow Matching Policy with Region-Aware Mamba Framework for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16201)**  `arXiv:2506.16201`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required. Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule, which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally, FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference speed.

- **[Noise Fusion-based Distillation Learning for Anomaly Detection in Complex Industrial Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16050)**  `arXiv:2506.16050`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust and real-time anomaly detection.

- **[Hierarchical and Modular Network on Non-prehensile Manipulation in General Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20843)**  `arXiv:2502.20843`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yoonyoung Cho, Junhyek Han, Jisu Han, Beomjoon Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For robots to operate in general environments like households, they must be able to perform non-prehensile manipulation actions such as toppling and rolling to manipulate ungraspable objects. However, prior works on non-prehensile manipulation cannot yet generalize across environments with diverse geometries. The main challenge lies in adapting to varying environmental constraints: within a cabinet, the robot must avoid walls and ceilings; to lift objects to the top of a step, the robot must account for the step's pose and extent. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive success in non-prehensile manipulation, accounting for such variability presents a challenge for the generalist policy, as it must learn diverse strategies for each new combination of constraints. To address this, we propose a modular and reconfigurable architecture that adaptively reconfigures network modules based on task requirements. To capture the geometric variability in environments, we extend the contact-based object representation (CORN) to environment geometries, and propose a procedural algorithm for generating diverse environments to train our agent. Taken together, the resulting policy can zero-shot transfer to novel real-world environments and objects despite training entirely within a simulator. We additionally release a simulation-based benchmark featuring nine digital twins of real-world scenes with 353 objects to facilitate non-prehensile manipulation research in realistic domains.

- **[Robo2VLM: Visual Question Answering from Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15517)**  `arXiv:2505.15517`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot, task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions - based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

- **[Grounding Language Models with Semantic Digital Twins for Robotic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16493)**  `arXiv:2506.16493`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Mehreen Naeem, Andrew Melnik, Michael Beetz_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel framework that integrates Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive and goal-driven robotic task execution in dynamic environments. The system decomposes natural language instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in the face of uncertainty and failure.

- **[Context Matters! Relaxing Goals with LLMs for Feasible 3D Scene Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15828)**  `arXiv:2506.15828`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Emanuele Musumeci, Michele Brienza, Francesco Argenziano, Vincenzo Suriani, Daniele Nardi, Domenico D. Bloisi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classical planning in AI and Robotics addresses complex tasks by shifting from imperative to declarative approaches (e.g., PDDL). However, these methods often fail in real scenarios due to limited robot perception and the need to ground perceptions to planning predicates. This often results in heavily hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions. We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. We also show how this method succeeds in complex scenarios where other benchmark methods are more likely to fail. Code, dataset, and additional material are released to the community.

- **[LeVERB: Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Latent Vision-Language Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13751)**  `arXiv:2506.13751`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Haoru Xue, Xiaoyu Huang, Dantong Niu, Qiayuan Liao, Thomas Kragerud, Jan Tommy Gravdahl, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.

- **[ViTacFormer: Learning Cross-Modal Representation for Visuo-Tactile Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15953)**  `arXiv:2506.15953`  `cs.RO`  
  _Liang Heng, Haoran Geng, Kaifeng Zhang, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dexterous manipulation is a cornerstone capability for robotic systems aiming to interact with the physical world in a human-like manner. Although vision-based methods have advanced rapidly, tactile sensing remains crucial for fine-grained control, particularly in unstructured or visually occluded settings. We present ViTacFormer, a representation-learning approach that couples a cross-attention encoder to fuse high-resolution vision and touch with an autoregressive tactile prediction head that anticipates future contact signals. Building on this architecture, we devise an easy-to-challenging curriculum that steadily refines the visual-tactile latent space, boosting both accuracy and robustness. The learned cross-modal representation drives imitation learning for multi-fingered hands, enabling precise and adaptive manipulation. Across a suite of challenging real-world benchmarks, our method achieves approximately 50% higher success rates than prior state-of-the-art systems. To our knowledge, it is also the first to autonomously complete long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks that demand highly precise control with an anthropomorphic hand, successfully executing up to 11 sequential stages and sustaining continuous operation for 2.5 minutes.

- **[Beyond Self-Talk: A Communication-Centric Survey of LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14321)**  `arXiv:2502.14321`  `cs.MA` `cs.CL`  
  _Bingyu Yan, Zhibo Zhou, Litian Zhang, Lian Zhang, Ziyi Zhou, Dezhuang Miao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model-based multi-agent systems have recently gained significant attention due to their potential for complex, collaborative, and intelligent problem-solving capabilities. Existing surveys typically categorize LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) according to their application domains or architectures, overlooking the central role of communication in coordinating agent behaviors and interactions. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-MAS from a communication-centric perspective. Specifically, we propose a structured framework that integrates system-level communication (architecture, goals, and protocols) with system internal communication (strategies, paradigms, objects, and content), enabling a detailed exploration of how agents interact, negotiate, and achieve collective intelligence. Through an extensive analysis of recent literature, we identify key components in multiple dimensions and summarize their strengths and limitations. In addition, we highlight current challenges, including communication efficiency, security vulnerabilities, inadequate benchmarking, and scalability issues, and outline promising future research directions. This review aims to help researchers and practitioners gain a clear understanding of the communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS, thereby facilitating the design and deployment of robust, scalable, and secure multi-agent systems.

- **[RecBayes: Recurrent Bayesian Ad Hoc Teamwork in Large Partially Observable Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15756)**  `arXiv:2506.15756`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Jo√£o G. Ribeiro, Yaniv Oren, Alberto Sardinha, Matthijs Spaan, Francisco S. Melo_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates. We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al., 2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks effectively.

- **[Generalizable Agent Modeling for Agent Collaboration-Competition Adaptation with Multi-Retrieval and Dynamic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16718)**  `arXiv:2506.16718`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges, necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents' learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC, Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing established baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled modern AI systems to comprehend and produce highly sophisticated content, even achieving human-level performance in specific domains. However, these models remain fundamentally constrained by catastrophic forgetting - a persistent challenge where adapting to new tasks typically leads to significant degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. To address this practical limitation, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the adaptability and scalability of generative models in real-world applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning methods for mainstream generative models, including large language models, multimodal large language models, vision language action models, and diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the memory mechanisms of the human brain, we systematically categorize these approaches into three paradigms: architecture-based, regularization-based, and replay-based methods, while elucidating their underlying methodologies and motivations. We further analyze continual learning setups for different generative models, including training objectives, benchmarks, and core backbones, offering deeper insights into the field.

- **[Training Multi-Layer Binary Neural Networks With Local Binary Error Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00119)**  `arXiv:2412.00119`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Luca Colombo, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

  _Ronald Skorobogat, Karsten Roth, Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu, Zeynep Akata_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.

- **[From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17052)**  `arXiv:2506.17052`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

- **[MadaKV: Adaptive Modality-Perception KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15724)**  `arXiv:2506.15724`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Kunxi Li, Zhonghua Jiang, Zhouzhou Shen, Zhaode Wang, Chengfei Lv, Shengyu Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios, attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads. Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency (1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various multimodal long-context tasks.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns (attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$ speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively, while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in long-context LLM inference.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).

  We study the process through which reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards (RLVR) can learn to solve new problems. We find that RLVR drives performance in two main ways: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via "capability gain" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\text{Guide}$ -- a new class of online training algorithms. $\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the "off-policy" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks. We include careful ablations to analyze $\text{Guide}$'s components and theoretically analyze Guide's learning efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular approach for aligning language models using pairwise preferences. However, in practical post-training pipelines, on-policy generation typically yields multiple candidate responses per prompt, which are scored by a reward model to guide learning. In this setting, we propose $\textbf{Multi-Preference Optimization (MPO)}$, a generalization of DPO that optimizes over entire sets of responses by extending the Bradley-Terry model to groupwise comparisons between chosen and rejected sets. To further enhance learning, MPO employs deviation-based weighting, which emphasizes outlier responses that deviate most from the mean reward, effectively inducing a self-paced curriculum. We theoretically prove that MPO reduces alignment bias at a rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ with respect to the number of responses per query. Empirically, MPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UltraFeedback benchmark and yields up to $\sim 17.5\%$ improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2, establishing a new baseline for preference-based alignment

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a new programming language called ALTA and a compiler that can map ALTA programs to Transformer weights. ALTA is inspired by RASP, a language proposed by Weiss et al. (2021), and Tracr (Lindner et al., 2023), a compiler from RASP programs to Transformer weights. ALTA complements and extends this prior work, offering the ability to express loops and to compile programs to Universal Transformers, among other advantages. ALTA allows us to constructively show how Transformers can represent length-invariant algorithms for computing parity and addition, as well as a solution to the SCAN benchmark of compositional generalization tasks, without requiring intermediate scratchpad decoding steps. We also propose tools to analyze cases where the expressibility of an algorithm is established, but end-to-end training on a given training set fails to induce behavior consistent with the desired algorithm. To this end, we explore training from ALTA execution traces as a more fine-grained supervision signal. This enables additional experiments and theoretical analyses relating the learnability of various algorithms to data availability and modeling decisions, such as positional encodings. We make the ALTA framework -- language specification, symbolic interpreter, and weight compiler -- available to the community to enable further applications and insights.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

  In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection commonly rely on synthetically generated traffic, which fails to reflect the statistical variability and temporal drift encountered in operational environments. This paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1 dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011, 2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and reproducibility.

  Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.

  With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models, conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard, and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance protocols to create a living benchmark available atthis https URL.

  Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence, particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules, auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

  Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs), yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to \textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii) robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing LLMs. Our project is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations. While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions, heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands, making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias. To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference, though challenges remain.

  Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3) multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08, while maintaining consistent accuracy across 96-720 step horizons in most of cases. These breakthroughs establish new benchmarks for efficient and precise time series modeling.

  Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong. This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

  Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression (SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore, we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge; rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without incurring its full computational cost.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets -- painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present $\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on $\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly available at:this https URL

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into the loss function. However, effective training of PINNs remains challenging due to internal covariate shift, which destabilizes feature distributions and impairs model expressiveness. While normalization techniques like Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are standard remedies in deep learning, they disrupt the pointwise input-output mappings critical to preserving the physical consistency in PINNs. In this work, we introduce Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture that regulates internal feature distributions through a smooth, learnable mask function applied pointwise across hidden layers. Unlike conventional normalization methods, the proposed mask function preserves the deterministic nature of input-output relationships while suppressing activation drift and saturation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs control feature spread near initialization by attenuating gradient variance growth through a tailored modulation mechanism. Empirically, we validate the method on multiple PDE benchmarks across diverse activation functions. Our results show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, convergence stability, and robustness, with relative L2 errors reduced by up to two orders of magnitude over baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs enable the effective use of wider networks, overcoming a key limitation in existing PINN frameworks.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) can provide adaptive and scalable controllers essential for power grid decarbonization. However, RL methods struggle with power grids' complex dynamics, long-horizon goals, and hard physical constraints. For these reasons, we present RL2Grid, a benchmark designed in collaboration with power system operators to accelerate progress in grid control and foster RL maturity. Built on RTE France's power simulation framework, RL2Grid standardizes tasks, state and action spaces, and reward structures for a systematic evaluation and comparison of RL algorithms. Moreover, we integrate operational heuristics and design safety constraints based on human expertise to ensure alignment with physical requirements. By establishing reference performance metrics for classic RL baselines on RL2Grid's tasks, we highlight the need for novel methods capable of handling real systems and discuss future directions for RL-based grid control.

  Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace. Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances. In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the power of scaling test-time compute to achieve strong performance on complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. This raises a critical question: how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$ independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy (CE) loss can be ${\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\it decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying shapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two traditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and test-time search and reasoning strategies.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model (seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors, leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically, Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N, across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat, chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and the reasoning-specific GSM8k.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however, directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation for future research in directed graph generation.

  Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals, including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a structured understanding of this rapidly evolving field and a roadmap for developing generalizable brain foundation models powered by self-supervision.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks, focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods, we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository is available atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion, preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework. Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT), further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target LLM's capabilities.

  Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods, such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

  Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench, significantly outperforming the best alternative.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expert systems often operate in domains characterized by class-imbalanced tabular data, where detecting rare but critical instances is essential for safety and reliability. While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems. Theoretical analyses reinforce its expressiveness, generalization, and optimization robustness.

  _Andre He, Daniel Fried, Sean Welleck_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning is emerging as a primary driver for improving language model reasoning capabilities. A fundamental question is whether current reinforcement learning algorithms -- such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the de facto standard algorithm used to improve language model reasoning -- merely sharpen the base model's distribution around problems it can already solve. We investigate this question in the context of formal theorem proving, which has access to a perfect verifier. We identify a degenerate rank bias in GRPO in which highly probable trajectories are reinforced and rare ones are neglected. This results in distribution sharpening: the model can solve some problems with fewer samples, but underperforms simply sampling more solutions from the original model. To overcome GRPO's rank bias we introduce unlikeliness reward, a simple method for explicitly up-weighting rare but correct solutions. We show that unlikeliness reward mitigates rank bias and improves pass@$N$ across a large range of $N$ in both synthetic and real theorem proving settings. We also uncover an unexpected link between rank bias and a seemingly mundane hyperparameter -- the number of updates per batch -- that leads to a second, complementary mitigation. We combine our insights into a revised GRPO training recipe for formal theorem proving, yielding an open pipeline that achieves competitive performance to DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL on the miniF2F-test benchmark. We release our implementation atthis https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2) human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning (ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent systems, enabling robust and data-efficient inductive generalization. Recent empirical evidence shows that many existing neural architectures, including Transformers, struggle with tasks requiring relational reasoning. In this work, we distinguish between two types of information: sensory information about the properties of individual objects, and relational information about the relationships between objects. While neural attention provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the flow of sensory information between objects, the Transformer lacks an explicit computational mechanism for routing and processing relational information. To address this limitation, we propose an architectural extension of the Transformer framework that we call the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), featuring two distinct attention mechanisms: sensory attention for directing the flow of sensory information, and a novel relational attention mechanism for directing the flow of relational information. We empirically evaluate DAT on a diverse set of tasks ranging from synthetic relational benchmarks to complex real-world tasks such as language modeling and visual processing. Our results demonstrate that integrating explicit relational computational mechanisms into the Transformer architecture leads to significant performance gains in terms of data efficiency and parameter efficiency.

  Neural architecture search (NAS) enables the automatic design of neural network models. However, training the candidates generated by the search algorithm for performance evaluation incurs considerable computational overhead.

Our training-free NAS method is data-agnostic and light-weight. It can find the best architecture among 200 randomly sampled architectures from NAS-Bench201 in 217 CPU seconds. Besides, our method is able to achieve competitive performance on various datasets including NASBench-101, NASBench-201, and NDS search spaces.

  Higher-order relations are widespread in nature, with numerous phenomena involving complex interactions that extend beyond simple pairwise connections. As a result, advancements in higher-order processing can accelerate the growth of various fields requiring structured data. Current approaches typically represent these interactions using hypergraphs. We enhance this representation by introducing cellular sheaves for hypergraphs, a mathematical construction that adds extra structure to the conventional hypergraph while maintaining their local, higherorder connectivity. Drawing inspiration from existing Laplacians in the literature, we develop two unique formulations of sheaf hypergraph Laplacians: linear and non-linear. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that incorporating sheaves into the hypergraph Laplacian provides a more expressive inductive bias than standard hypergraph diffusion, creating a powerful instrument for effectively modelling complex data structures. We employ these sheaf hypergraph Laplacians to design two categories of models: Sheaf Hypergraph Neural Networks and Sheaf Hypergraph Convolutional Networks. These models generalize classical Hypergraph Networks often found in the literature. Through extensive experimentation, we show that this generalization significantly improves performance, achieving top results on multiple benchmark datasets for hypergraph node classification.

To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.The source code for our implementation will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.

  The tradeoff between reconstruction quality and compute required for video super-resolution (VSR) remains a formidable challenge in its adoption for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While transformer-based VSR models have set new benchmarks for reconstruction quality in recent years, these require substantial computational resources. On the other hand, lightweight models that have been introduced even recently struggle to deliver state-of-the-art reconstruction. We propose a novel lightweight and parameter-efficient neural architecture for VSR that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy with just 2.3 million parameters. Our model enhances information utilization based on several architectural attributes. Firstly, it uses 2D wavelet decompositions strategically interlayered with learnable convolutional layers to utilize the inductive prior of spatial sparsity of edges in visual data. Secondly, it uses a single memory tensor to capture inter-frame temporal information while avoiding the computational cost of previous memory-based schemes. Thirdly, it uses residual deformable convolutions for implicit inter-frame object alignment that improve upon deformable convolutions by enhancing spatial information in inter-frame feature differences. Architectural insights from our model can pave the way for real-time VSR on the edge, such as display devices for streaming data.

  Designing structured visuals such as presentation slides is essential for communicative needs, necessitating both content creation and visual planning skills. In this work, we tackle the challenge of automated slide generation, where models produce slide presentations from natural language (NL) instructions. We first introduce the SlidesBench benchmark, the first benchmark for slide generation with 7k training and 585 testing examples derived from 310 slide decks across 10 domains. SlidesBench supports evaluations that are (i)reference-based to measure similarity to a target slide, and (ii)reference-free to measure the design quality of generated slides alone. We benchmark end-to-end image generation and program generation methods with a variety of models, and find that programmatic methods produce higher-quality slides in user-interactable formats. Built on the success of program generation, we create AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on 7k pairs of instructions paired with code for slide generation, and achieve results comparable to the closed-source model GPT-4o. We further explore iterative design refinement where the model is tasked to self-refine its own output, and we found that this process improves the slide's quality. We hope that our work will provide a basis for future work on generating structured visuals.

  An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation.

  Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than $1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally, we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for resource-constrained domains.

  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities. To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task. Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video.

  Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO, have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1, we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9% consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limitingthis http URLaddress this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.

  Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT) training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths. Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1, trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks.

  Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

  Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human, multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline, leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions. Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods, identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world applications.

  Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, making early detection and accurate treatment response monitoring critical priorities. We present BreastDCEDL, a curated, deep learning-ready dataset comprising pre-treatment 3D Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans from 2,070 breast cancer patients drawn from the I-SPY1, I-SPY2, and Duke cohorts, all sourced from The Cancer Imaging Archive. The raw DICOM imaging data were rigorously converted into standardized 3D NIfTI volumes with preserved signal integrity, accompanied by unified tumor annotations and harmonized clinical metadata including pathologic complete response (pCR), hormone receptor (HR), and HER2 status. Although DCE-MRI provides essential diagnostic information and deep learning offers tremendous potential for analyzing such complex data, progress has been limited by lack of accessible, public, multicenter datasets. BreastDCEDL addresses this gap by enabling development of advanced models, including state-of-the-art transformer architectures that require substantial training data. To demonstrate its capacity for robust modeling, we developed the first transformer-based model for breast DCE-MRI, leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture trained on RGB-fused images from three contrast phases (pre-contrast, early post-contrast, and late post-contrast). Our ViT model achieved state-of-the-art pCR prediction performance in HR+/HER2- patients (AUC 0.94, accuracy 0.93). BreastDCEDL includes predefined benchmark splits, offering a framework for reproducible research and enabling clinically meaningful modeling in breast cancer imaging.

  World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure, we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views, positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis, instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced embodied reasoning capabilities.

  As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

  Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.

  3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as the prediction range expands.

Despite significant progress in vision learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges: semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection. CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA), which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF achieving a mAP of 78.6% on the DroneVehicle dataset.

  While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:this https URL

  Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden, severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half - establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

  We investigate whether off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can tackle Online Episodic-Memory Video Question Answering (OEM-VQA) without additional training. Our pipeline converts a streaming egocentric video into a lightweight textual memory, only a few kilobytes per minute, via an MLLM descriptor module, and answers multiple-choice questions by querying this memory with an LLM reasoner module. On the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark, our best configuration attains 56.0% accuracy with 3.6 kB per minute storage, matching the performance of dedicated state-of-the-art systems while being 10**4/10**5 times more memory-efficient. Extensive ablations provides insights into the role of each component and design choice, and highlight directions of improvement for future research.

  By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception. Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts, highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation utilities.

  As perception models continue to develop, the need for large-scale datasets increases. However, data annotation remains far too expensive to effectively scale and meet the demand. Synthetic datasets provide a solution to boost model performance with substantially reduced costs. However, current synthetic datasets remain limited in their scope, realism, and are designed for specific tasks and applications. In this work, we present RealDriveSim, a realistic multi-modal synthetic dataset for autonomous driving that not only supports popular 2D computer vision applications but also their LiDAR counterparts, providing fine-grained annotations for up to 64 classes. We extensively evaluate our dataset for a wide range of applications and domains, demonstrating state-of-the-art results compared to existing synthetic benchmarks.

  Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile, given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring, while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization, our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new dataset will be released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing methods.

  Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of ``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

  Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2, harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask, polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%, respectively.

  Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities. A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark, ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code available at:this https URL.

  Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

  We present Genesis, a unified framework for joint generation of multi-view driving videos and LiDAR sequences with spatio-temporal and cross-modal consistency. Genesis employs a two-stage architecture that integrates a DiT-based video diffusion model with 3D-VAE encoding, and a BEV-aware LiDAR generator with NeRF-based rendering and adaptive sampling. Both modalities are directly coupled through a shared latent space, enabling coherent evolution across visual and geometric domains. To guide the generation with structured semantics, we introduce DataCrafter, a captioning module built on vision-language models that provides scene-level and instance-level supervision. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that Genesis achieves state-of-the-art performance across video and LiDAR metrics (FVD 16.95, FID 4.24, Chamfer 0.611), and benefits downstream tasks including segmentation and 3D detection, validating the semantic fidelity and practical utility of the generated data.

  As a core step in structure-from-motion and SLAM, robust feature detection and description under challenging scenarios such as significant viewpoint changes remain unresolved despite their ubiquity. While recent works have identified the importance of local features in modeling geometric transformations, these methods fail to learn the visual cues present in long-range relationships. We present Robust Deformable Detector (RDD), a novel and robust keypoint detector/descriptor leveraging the deformable transformer, which captures global context and geometric invariance through deformable self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we observed that deformable attention focuses on key locations, effectively reducing the search space complexity and modeling the geometric invariance. Furthermore, we collected an Air-to-Ground dataset for training in addition to the standard MegaDepth dataset. Our proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art keypoint detection/description methods in sparse matching tasks and is also capable of semi-dense matching. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, we introduce two challenging benchmarks: one emphasizing large viewpoint and scale variations, and the other being an Air-to-Ground benchmark -- an evaluation setting that has recently gaining popularity for 3D reconstruction across different altitudes.

  Video event detection is central to modern sports analytics, enabling automated understanding of key moments for performance evaluation, content creation, and tactical feedback. While deep learning has significantly advanced tasks like Temporal Action Localization (TAL), Action Spotting (AS), and Precise Event Spotting (PES), existing surveys often overlook the fine-grained temporal demands and domain-specific challenges posed by sports. This survey first provides a clear conceptual distinction between TAL, AS, and PES, then introduces a methods-based taxonomy covering recent deep learning approaches for AS and PES, including feature-based pipelines, end-to-end architectures, and multimodal strategies. We further review benchmark datasets and evaluation protocols, identifying critical limitations such as reliance on broadcast-quality footage and lenient multi-label metrics that hinder real-world deployment. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions toward more temporally precise, generalizable, and practical event spotting in sports video analysis.

  Despite the tremendous success of deep learning in computer vision, models still fall behind humans in generalizing to new input distributions. Existing benchmarks do not investigate the specific failure points of models by analyzing performance under many controlled conditions. Our study systematically dissects where and why models struggle with contour integration -- a hallmark of human vision -- by designing an experiment that tests object recognition under various levels of object fragmentation. Humans (n=50) perform at high accuracy, even with few object contours present. This is in contrast to models which exhibit substantially lower sensitivity to increasing object contours, with most of the over 1,000 models we tested barely performing above chance. Only at very large scales ($\sim5B$ training dataset size) do models begin to approach human performance. Importantly, humans exhibit an integration bias -- a preference towards recognizing objects made up of directional fragments over directionless fragments. We find that not only do models that share this property perform better at our task, but that this bias also increases with model training dataset size, and training models to exhibit contour integration leads to high shape bias. Taken together, our results suggest that contour integration is a hallmark of object vision that underlies object recognition performance, and may be a mechanism learned from data at scale.

  Advancements in computer-assisted surgical procedures heavily rely on accurate visual data interpretation from camera systems used during surgeries. Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos with less than 100K images. To address these constraints, a new dataset called Surg-3M has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos totaling 938 hours of high-quality footage across multiple procedure types, Surg-3M offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this dataset, we present SurgFM, a self-supervised foundation model pretrained on Surg-3M that achieves impressive results in downstream tasks such as surgical phase recognition, action recognition, and tool presence detection. Combining key components from ConvNeXt, DINO, and an innovative augmented distillation method, SurgFM exhibits exceptional performance compared to specialist architectures across various benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in multiple downstream tasks, including significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+8.9pp, +4.7pp, and +3.9pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), action recognition (+3.1pp of mAP in CholecT50) and tool presence detection (+4.6pp of mAP in Cholec80). Moreover, even when using only half of the data, SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in AutoLaparo and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Cholec80. Both Surg-3M and SurgFM have significant potential to accelerate progress towards developing autonomous robotic surgery systems.

  Current Visual Language Models (VLMs) show impressive image understanding but struggle with visual illusions, especially in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks focus on classical cognitive illusions, which have been learned by state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, revealing issues such as hallucinations and limited perceptual abilities. To address this gap, we introduce IllusionBench, a comprehensive visual illusion dataset that encompasses not only classic cognitive illusions but also real-world scene illusions. This dataset features 1,051 images, 5,548 question-answer pairs, and 1,051 golden text descriptions that address the presence, causes, and content of the illusions. We evaluate ten SOTA VLMs on this dataset using true-or-false, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. In addition to real-world illusions, we design trap illusions that resemble classical patterns but differ in reality, highlighting hallucination issues in SOTA models. The top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 80.59% accuracy on true-or-false tasks and 76.75% on multiple-choice questions, but still lags behind human performance. In the semantic description task, GPT-4o's hallucinations on classical illusions result in low scores for trap illusions, even falling behind some open-source models. IllusionBench is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual illusions in VLMs to date.

  Large-scale datasets have been pivotal to the advancements of deep learning models in recent years, but training on such large datasets invariably incurs substantial storage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, real-world datasets often contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training efficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in identifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims to minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works typically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for individual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when dealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal information for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically, our framework consists of three key modules-dataset adaptation, sample scoring, and selection optimization-that together harness extensive pre-trained multimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize the selection results through multi-objective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on various benchmark datasets. Notably, our method effectively removes noisy or damaged samples from the dataset, enabling it to achieve even higher performance with less data. This indicates that it is not only a way to accelerate training but can also improve overall data quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual object tracking and segmentation in omnidirectional videos are challenging due to the wide field-of-view and large spherical distortion brought by 360¬∞ images. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset. Homepage:this https URL

  In this paper, we present a novel visual SLAM and long-term localization benchmark for autonomous driving in challenging conditions based on the large-scale 4Seasons dataset. The proposed benchmark provides drastic appearance variations caused by seasonal changes and diverse weather and illumination conditions. While significant progress has been made in advancing visual SLAM on small-scale datasets with similar conditions, there is still a lack of unified benchmarks representative of real-world scenarios for autonomous driving. We introduce a new unified benchmark for jointly evaluating visual odometry, global place recognition, and map-based visual localization performance which is crucial to successfully enable autonomous driving in any condition. The data has been collected for more than one year, resulting in more than 300 km of recordings in nine different environments ranging from a multi-level parking garage to urban (including tunnels) to countryside and highway. We provide globally consistent reference poses with up to centimeter-level accuracy obtained from the fusion of direct stereo-inertial odometry with RTK GNSS. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art visual odometry and visual localization baseline approaches on the benchmark and analyze their properties. The experimental results provide new insights into current approaches and show promising potential for future research. Our benchmark and evaluation protocols will be available atthis https URL.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sampling from language models impacts the quality and diversity of outputs, affecting both research and real-world applications. Recently, Nguyen et al. 2024's "Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs" introduced a new sampler called min-p, claiming it achieves superior quality and diversity over established samplers such as basic, top-k, and top-p sampling. The significance of these claims was underscored by the paper's recognition as the 18th highest-scoring submission to ICLR 2025 and selection for an Oral presentation. This paper conducts a comprehensive re-examination of the evidence supporting min-p and reaches different conclusions from the original paper's four lines of evidence. First, the original paper's human evaluations omitted data, conducted statistical tests incorrectly, and described qualitative feedback inaccurately; our reanalysis demonstrates min-p did not outperform baselines in quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity; in response to our findings, the authors of the original paper conducted a new human evaluation using a different implementation, task, and rubric that nevertheless provides further evidence min-p does not improve over baselines. Second, comprehensively sweeping the original paper's NLP benchmarks reveals min-p does not surpass baselines when controlling for the number of hyperparameters. Third, the original paper's LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations lack methodological clarity and appear inconsistently reported. Fourth, community adoption claims (49k GitHub repositories, 1.1M GitHub stars) were found to be unsubstantiated, leading to their removal; the revised adoption claim remains misleading. We conclude that evidence presented in the original paper fails to support claims that min-p improves quality, diversity, or a trade-off between quality and diversity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education, yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By constraining all predictive information to pass through a short natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) possess a world model-a structured understanding of the world that supports generalization beyond surface-level patterns-is central to assessing their reliability, especially in high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's internal understanding of the world.

  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3) Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

  While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive abilities over high-level perception and reasoning, their robustness in the wild remains limited, often falling short on tasks that are intuitive and effortless for humans. We examine the hypothesis that these deficiencies stem from the absence of core knowledge--rudimentary cognitive abilities innate to humans from early childhood. To explore the core knowledge representation in MLLMs, we introduce CoreCognition, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 12 core knowledge concepts grounded in developmental cognitive science. We evaluate 230 models with 11 different prompts, leading to a total of 2,530 data points for analysis. Our experiments uncover four key findings, collectively demonstrating core knowledge deficits in MLLMs: they consistently underperform and show reduced, or even absent, scalability on low-level abilities relative to high-level ones. Finally, we propose Concept Hacking, a novel controlled evaluation method that reveals MLLMs fail to progress toward genuine core knowledge understanding, but instead rely on shortcut learning as they scale.

  Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B. Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as translation and localization.

  LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks; and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset, code, and model evaluations are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale selection for reliable preference modeling.

  After the release of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained huge popularity in recent days and thousands of variants of LLMs have been released. However, there is no generative language model for the Nepali language, due to which other downstream tasks, including fine-tuning, have not been explored yet. To fill this research gap in the Nepali NLP space, this research proposes \textit{NepaliGPT}, a generative large language model tailored specifically for the Nepali language. This research introduces an advanced corpus for the Nepali language collected from several sources, called the Devanagari Corpus. Likewise, the research introduces the first NepaliGPT benchmark dataset comprised of 4,296 question-answer pairs in the Nepali language. The proposed LLM NepaliGPT achieves the following metrics in text generation: Perplexity of 26.32245, ROUGE-1 score of 0.2604, causal coherence of 81.25\%, and causal consistency of 85.41\%.

  The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System (GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa + GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and 94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

  Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. Our code is available here.

  _Wenxuan Xie, Yaxun Dai, Wenhao Jiang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task. However, prior approaches typically rely on static, pre-processed database information provided at inference time, which limits the model's ability to fully understand the database contents. Without dynamic interaction, LLMs are constrained to fixed, human-provided context and cannot autonomously explore the underlying data. To address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling. Moreover, with SFT, the performance of SDE-SQL can be further enhanced, yielding an additional 0.52% improvement.

  Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

  The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.

However, linguistic nuances of under-resourced languages remain unexplored. We introduce Batayan, a holistic Filipino benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs across three key natural language processing (NLP) competencies: understanding, reasoning, and generation. Batayan consolidates eight tasks, three of which have not existed prior for Filipino corpora, covering both Tagalog and code-switched Taglish utterances. Our rigorous, native-speaker-driven adaptation and validation processes ensures fluency and authenticity to the complex morphological and syntactic structures of Filipino, alleviating the pervasive translationese bias in existing Filipino corpora. We report empirical results on a variety of open-source and commercial LLMs, highlighting significant performance gaps that signal the under-representation of Filipino in pre-training corpora, the unique hurdles in modeling Filipino's rich morphology and construction, and the importance of explicit Filipino language support. Moreover, we discuss the practical challenges encountered in dataset construction and propose principled solutions for building culturally and linguistically-faithful resources in under-represented languages. We also provide a public evaluation suite as a clear foundation for iterative, community-driven progress in Filipino NLP.

  The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a critical challenge: accurate hallucination evaluation that ensures model reliability. While Automatic Hallucination Evaluation (AHE) has emerged as essential, the field suffers from methodological fragmentation, hindering both theoretical understanding and practical advancement. This survey addresses this critical gap through a comprehensive analysis of 74 evaluation methods, revealing that 74% specifically target LLMs, a paradigm shift that demands new evaluation frameworks. We formulate a unified evaluation pipeline encompassing datasets and benchmarks, evidence collection strategies, and comparison mechanisms, systematically documenting the evolution from pre-LLM to post-LLM methodologies. Beyond taxonomical organization, we identify fundamental limitations in current approaches and their implications for real-world deployment. To guide future research, we delineate key challenges and propose strategic directions, including enhanced interpretability mechanisms and integration of application-specific evaluation criteria, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing more robust and practical hallucination evaluation systems.

  Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However, fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them. Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performingthis http URL, CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways: they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) -- offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions. Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available at: \texttt{this https URL}.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap, we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232 programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models, reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in competitive-level code reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients, generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense, mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

  Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish. We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures. Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish) communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\% on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection, providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying detection.

  _Duc Hieu Ho, Chenglin Fan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions. It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI, Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy, self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including self-critique step and refinement step.The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework $\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

  Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics, which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance. Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of perspective summarization methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score. Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical question-answering.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress in financial NLP and applications, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to monolingual and unimodal settings, often over-relying on simple tasks and failing to reflect the complexity of real-world financial communication. We introduce MultiFinBen, the first multilingual and multimodal benchmark tailored to the global financial domain, evaluating LLMs across modalities (text, vision, audio) and linguistic settings (monolingual, bilingual, multilingual) on domain-specific tasks. We introduce two novel tasks, including PolyFiQA-Easy and PolyFiQA-Expert, the first multilingual financial benchmarks requiring models to perform complex reasoning over mixed-language inputs; and EnglishOCR and SpanishOCR, the first OCR-embedded financial QA tasks challenging models to extract and reason over information from visual-text financial documents. Moreover, we propose a dynamic, difficulty-aware selection mechanism and curate a compact, balanced benchmark rather than simple aggregation existing datasets. Extensive evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art models reveals that even the strongest models, despite their general multimodal and multilingual capabilities, struggle dramatically when faced with complex cross-lingual and multimodal tasks in financial domain. MultiFinBen is publicly released to foster transparent, reproducible, and inclusive progress in financial studies and applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context, German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input variants using Nystr√∂mformer and Longformer architectures with support for sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification (GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A core part of legal work that has been under-explored in Legal NLP is the writing and editing of legal briefs. This requires not only a thorough understanding of the law of a jurisdiction, from judgments to statutes, but also the ability to make new arguments to try to expand the law in a new direction and make novel and creative arguments that are persuasive to judges. To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating human-generated headings. Yet, they perform poorly on other tasks in our benchmark: realistic argument completion and retrieving relevant legal cases. We hope this dataset encourages more development in Legal NLP in ways that will specifically aid people in performing legal work.

  Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics. All data are available atthis https URL, and the code is available atthis https URL.

  Africa's rich linguistic diversity remains significantly underrepresented in speech technologies, creating barriers to digital inclusion. To alleviate this challenge, we systematically map the continent's speech space of datasets and technologies, leading to a new comprehensive benchmark SimbaBench for downstream African speech tasks. Using SimbaBench, we introduce the Simba family of models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple African languages and speech tasks. Our benchmark analysis reveals critical patterns in resource availability, while our model evaluation demonstrates how dataset quality, domain diversity, and language family relationships influence performance across languages. Our work highlights the need for expanded speech technology resources that better reflect Africa's linguistic diversity and provides a solid foundation for future research and development efforts toward more inclusive speech technologies.

  Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) in fields like law necessitates frameworks that account for nuanced regional legal distinctions, which are critical for ensuring compliance and trustworthiness. Existing legal evaluation benchmarks often lack adaptability and fail to address diverse local contexts, limiting their utility in dynamically evolving regulatory landscapes. To address these gaps, we propose AutoLaw, a novel violation detection framework that combines adversarial data generation with a jury-inspired deliberation process to enhance legal compliance of LLMs. Unlike static approaches, AutoLaw dynamically synthesizes case law to reflect local regulations and employs a pool of LLM-based "jurors" to simulate judicial decision-making. Jurors are ranked and selected based on synthesized legal expertise, enabling a deliberation process that minimizes bias and improves detection accuracy. Evaluations across three benchmarks: Law-SG, Case-SG (legality), and Unfair-TOS (policy), demonstrate AutoLaw's effectiveness: adversarial data generation improves LLM discrimination, while the jury-based voting strategy significantly boosts violation detection rates. Our results highlight the framework's ability to adaptively probe legal misalignments and deliver reliable, context-aware judgments, offering a scalable solution for evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential in the field of health care, yet they face great challenges in adapting to rapidly evolving medical knowledge. This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions. This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines, focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.

  In the evolving landscape of online discourse, misinformation increasingly adopts humorous tones to evade detection and gain traction. This work introduces Deceptive Humor as a novel research direction, emphasizing how false narratives, when coated in humor, can become more difficult to detect and more likely to spread. To support research in this space, we present the Deceptive Humor Dataset (DHD) a collection of humor-infused comments derived from fabricated claims using the ChatGPT-4o model. Each entry is labeled with a Satire Level (from 1 for subtle satire to 3 for overt satire) and categorized into five humor types: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and Absurdity. The dataset spans English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed forms, making it a valuable resource for multilingual analysis. DHD offers a structured foundation for understanding how humor can serve as a vehicle for the propagation of misinformation, subtly enhancing its reach and impact. Strong baselines are established to encourage further research and model development in this emerging area.

Traditional open source tools often produce lower quality extractions compared to vision language models (VLMs), but reliance on the best VLMs can be prohibitively costly (e.g., over $6,240 USD per million PDF pages for GPT-4o) or infeasible if the PDFs cannot be sent to proprietary APIs. We present olmOCR, an open-source toolkit for processing PDFs into clean, linearized plain text in natural reading order while preserving structured content like sections, tables, lists, equations, and more. Our toolkit runs a fine-tuned 7B vision language model (VLM) trained on olmOCR-mix-0225, a sample of 260,000 pages from over 100,000 crawled PDFs with diverse properties, including graphics, handwritten text and poor quality scans. olmOCR is optimized for large-scale batch processing, able to scale flexibly to different hardware setups and can convert a million PDF pages for only $176 USD. To aid comparison with existing systems, we also introduce olmOCR-Bench, a curated set of 1,400 PDFs capturing many content types that remain challenging even for the best tools and VLMs, including formulas, tables, tiny fonts, old scans, and more. We find olmOCR outperforms even top VLMs including GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2 and Qwen-2.5-VL. We openly release all components of olmOCR: our fine-tuned VLM model, training code and data, an efficient inference pipeline that supports vLLM and SGLang backends, and benchmark olmOCR-Bench.

  Despite the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in English, a significant performance gap remains in non-English languages. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for strategically constructing a multilingual synthetic instruction tuning dataset, sPhinX. Unlike prior methods that directly translate fixed instruction-response pairs, sPhinX enhances diversity by selectively augmenting English instruction-response pairs with multilingual translations. Additionally, we propose LANGIT, a novel N-shot guided fine-tuning strategy, which further enhances model performance by incorporating contextually relevant examples in each training sample. Our ablation study shows that our approach enhances the multilingual capabilities of Mistral-7B and Phi-3-Small improving performance by an average of 39.8% and 11.2%, respectively, across multilingual benchmarks in reasoning, question answering, reading comprehension, and machine translation. Moreover, sPhinX maintains strong performance on English LLM benchmarks while exhibiting minimal to no catastrophic forgetting, even when trained on 51 languages.

  Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is pivotal in Industry 4.0 and 5.0, proactively enhancing efficiency through accurate equipment Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, thus optimizing maintenance scheduling and reducing unexpected failures and premature interventions. This paper introduces a novel RUL estimation approach leveraging State Space Models (SSM) for efficient long-term sequence modeling. To handle model uncertainty, Simoultaneous Quantile Regression (SQR) is integrated into the SSM, enabling multiple quantile estimations. The proposed method is benchmarked against traditional sequence modelling techniques (LSTM, Transformer, Informer) using the C-MAPSS dataset. Results demonstrate superior accuracy and computational efficiency of SSM models, underscoring their potential for high-stakes industrial applications.

  As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves. While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods, particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

  As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$. Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future investigations into designing variable system prompts.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding. $\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement learning objective with increasing beam width.

  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task, SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and (iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally, logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

  The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.

  The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity, bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of such benchmarks.

  Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field. However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods. As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones, non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in Agentic AI.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.

  Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

  Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability, particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps: entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs' interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture. Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates, compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

  Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making; however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans, remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants. Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

  Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values. Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority and strong generalization.

  With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents.

  Can a scientific simulation system be physically consistent, interpretable by design, and scalable across regimes--all at once? Despite decades of progress, this trifecta remains elusive. Classical methods like Kinetic Monte Carlo ensure thermodynamic accuracy but scale poorly; learning-based methods offer efficiency but often sacrifice physical consistency and interpretability. We present SwarmThinkers, a reinforcement learning framework that recasts atomic-scale simulation as a physically grounded swarm intelligence system. Each diffusing particle is modeled as a local decision-making agent that selects transitions via a shared policy network trained under thermodynamic constraints. A reweighting mechanism fuses learned preferences with transition rates, preserving statistical fidelity while enabling interpretable, step-wise decision making. Training follows a centralized-training, decentralized-execution paradigm, allowing the policy to generalize across system sizes, concentrations, and temperatures without retraining. On a benchmark simulating radiation-induced Fe-Cu alloy precipitation, SwarmThinkers is the first system to achieve full-scale, physically consistent simulation on a single A100 GPU, previously attainable only via OpenKMC on a supercomputer. It delivers up to 4963x (3185x on average) faster computation with 485x lower memory usage. By treating particles as decision-makers, not passive samplers, SwarmThinkers marks a paradigm shift in scientific simulation--one that unifies physical consistency, interpretability, and scalability through agent-driven intelligence.

  Embodied agents exhibit immense potential across a multitude of domains, making the assurance of their behavioral safety a fundamental prerequisite for their widespread deployment. However, existing research predominantly concentrates on the security of general large language models, lacking specialized methodologies for establishing safety benchmarks and input moderation tailored to embodied agents. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel input moderation framework, meticulously designed to safeguard embodied agents. This framework encompasses the entire pipeline, including taxonomy definition, dataset curation, moderator architecture, model training, and rigorous evaluation. Notably, we introduce EAsafetyBench, a meticulously crafted safety benchmark engineered to facilitate both the training and stringent assessment of moderators specifically designed for embodied agents. Furthermore, we propose Pinpoint, an innovative prompt-decoupled input moderation scheme that harnesses a masked attention mechanism to effectively isolate and mitigate the influence of functional prompts on moderation tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets and models validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve an impressive average detection accuracy of 94.58%, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques, alongside an exceptional moderation processing time of merely 0.002 seconds per instance.

  Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.

Some approaches utilize synthetic data generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models. However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a diagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an enhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and diversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00% improvement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in academic exams. Code and data are available on GitHub.
