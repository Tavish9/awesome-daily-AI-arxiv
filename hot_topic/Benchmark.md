- **[$\textit{Agents Under Siege}$: Breaking Pragmatic Multi-Agent LLM Systems with Optimized Prompt Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00218)**  `arXiv:2504.00218`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and decentralized reasoning. In this work, we innovatively focus on attacking pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a $\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and $\texttt{AdversarialBench}$, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to $7\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that existing defenses, including variants of $\texttt{Llama-Guard}$ and $\texttt{PromptGuard}$, fail to prohibit our attack, emphasizing the urgent need for multi-agent specific safety mechanisms.

  Meta-Continual Learning (Meta-CL) has emerged as a promising approach to minimize manual labeling efforts and system resource requirements by enabling Continual Learning (CL) with limited labeled samples. However, while existing methods have shown success in image-based tasks, their effectiveness remains unexplored for sequential time-series data from sensor systems, particularly audio inputs. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study evaluating six representative Meta-CL approaches using three network architectures on five datasets from both image and audio modalities. We develop MetaCLBench, an end-to-end Meta-CL benchmark framework for edge devices to evaluate system overheads and investigate trade-offs among performance, computational costs, and memory requirements across various Meta-CL methods. Our results reveal that while many Meta-CL methods enable to learn new classes for both image and audio modalities, they impose significant computational and memory costs on edge devices. Also, we find that pre-training and meta-training procedures based on source data before deployment improve Meta-CL performance. Finally, to facilitate further research, we provide practical guidelines for researchers and machine learning practitioners implementing Meta-CL on resource-constrained environments and make our benchmark framework and tools publicly available, enabling fair evaluation across both accuracy and system-level metrics.

- **[Benchmarking Federated Machine Unlearning methods for Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00921)**  `arXiv:2504.00921`  `cs.LG`  
  _Chenguang Xiao, Abhirup Ghosh, Han Wu, Shuo Wang, Diederick van Thiel_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning, which enables a model to forget specific data upon request, is increasingly relevant in the era of privacy-centric machine learning, particularly within federated learning (FL) environments. This paper presents a pioneering study on benchmarking machine unlearning methods within a federated setting for tabular data, addressing the unique challenges posed by cross-silo FL where data privacy and communication efficiency are paramount. We explore unlearning at the feature and instance levels, employing both machine learning, random forest and logistic regression models. Our methodology benchmarks various unlearning algorithms, including fine-tuning and gradient-based approaches, across multiple datasets, with metrics focused on fidelity, certifiability, and computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that while fidelity remains high across methods, tree-based models excel in certifiability, ensuring exact unlearning, whereas gradient-based methods show improved computational efficiency. This study provides critical insights into the design and selection of unlearning algorithms tailored to the FL environment, offering a foundation for further research in privacy-preserving machine learning.

- **[Sim-is-More: Randomizing HW-NAS with Synthetic Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00663)**  `arXiv:2504.00663`  `cs.LG`  
  _Francesco Capuano, Gabriele Tiboni, Niccol√≤ Cavagnero, Giuseppe Averta_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing hardware-aware NAS (HW-NAS) methods typically assume access to precise information circa the target device, either via analytical approximations of the post-compilation latency model, or through learned latency predictors. Such approximate approaches risk introducing estimation errors that may prove detrimental in risk-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose a two-stage HW-NAS framework, in which we first learn an architecture controller on a distribution of synthetic devices, and then directly deploy the controller on a target device. At test-time, our network controller deploys directly to the target device without relying on any pre-collected information, and only exploits direct interactions. In particular, the pre-training phase on synthetic devices enables the controller to design an architecture for the target device by interacting with it through a small number of high-fidelity latency measurements. To guarantee accessibility of our method, we only train our controller with training-free accuracy proxies, allowing us to scale the meta-training phase without incurring the overhead of full network training. We benchmark on HW-NATS-Bench, demonstrating that our method generalizes to unseen devices and searches for latency-efficient architectures by in-context adaptation using only a few real-world latency evaluations at test-time.

- **[VL-ICL Bench: The Devil in the Details of Multimodal In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13164)**  `arXiv:2403.13164`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yongshuo Zong, Ondrej Bohdal, Timothy Hospedales_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) famously exhibit emergent in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks using few-shot examples provided as a prompt, without updating the model's weights. Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into \emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL.

- **[TurboFill: Adapting Few-step Text-to-image Model for Fast Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00996)**  `arXiv:2504.00996`  `cs.CV`  
  _Liangbin Xie, Daniil Pakhomov, Zhonghao Wang, Zongze Wu, Ziyan Chen, Yuqian Zhou, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces TurboFill, a fast image inpainting model that enhances a few-step text-to-image diffusion model with an inpainting adapter for high-quality and efficient inpainting. While standard diffusion models generate high-quality results, they incur high computational costs. We overcome this by training an inpainting adapter on a few-step distilled text-to-image model, DMD2, using a novel 3-step adversarial training scheme to ensure realistic, structurally consistent, and visually harmonious inpainted regions. To evaluate TurboFill, we propose two benchmarks: DilationBench, which tests performance across mask sizes, and HumanBench, based on human feedback for complex prompts. Experiments show that TurboFill outperforms both multi-step BrushNet and few-step inpainting methods, setting a new benchmark for high-performance inpainting tasks. Our project page:this https URL

- **[Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking inRule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16188)**  `arXiv:2503.16188`  `cs.CV`  
  _Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Shitian Zhao, Yuxiang Lai, Kaipeng Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning for visual classification using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and the role of the thinking process. We begin by exploring \textit{CLS-RL}, a method that leverages verifiable signals as rewards to encourage MLLMs to 'think' before classifying. Our experiments across \textbf{eleven} datasets demonstrate that CLS-RL achieves significant improvements over supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both base-to-new generalization and few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, we observe a 'free-lunch' phenomenon where fine-tuning on one dataset unexpectedly enhances performance on others, suggesting that RL effectively teaches fundamental classification skills. However, we question whether the explicit thinking, a critical aspect of rule-based RL, is always beneficial or indispensable. Challenging the conventional assumption that complex reasoning enhances performance, we introduce \textit{No-Thinking-RL}, a novel approach that minimizes the model's thinking during fine-tuning by utilizing an equality accuracy reward. Our experiments reveal that No-Thinking-RL achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities compared to CLS-RL, while requiring significantly less fine-tuning time. This underscores that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, reducing the thinking process can lead to more efficient and effective MLLM fine-tuning for some visual tasks. Furthermore, No-Thinking-RL demonstrates enhanced performance on other visual benchmarks, such as a 6.4\% improvement on CVBench. We hope our findings provides insights into the impact of thinking in RL-based fine-tuning.

- **[LVAgent: Long Video Understanding by Multi-Round Dynamical Collaboration of MLLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10200)**  `arXiv:2503.10200`  `cs.CV`  
  _Boyu Chen, Zhengrong Yue, Siran Chen, Zikang Wang, Yang Liu, Peng Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant challenges in modeling the temporal context within long videos. Currently, mainstream Agent-based methods use external tools (e.g., search engine, memory banks, OCR, retrieval models) to assist a single MLLM in answering long video questions. Despite such tool-based support, a solitary MLLM still offers only a partial understanding of long videos, resulting in limited performance. In order to better address long video tasks, we introduce LVAgent, the first framework enabling multi-round dynamic collaboration of MLLM agents in long video understanding. Our methodology consists of four key steps: 1. Selection: We pre-select appropriate agents from the model library to form optimal agent teams based on different tasks. 2. Perception: We design an effective retrieval scheme for long videos, improving the coverage of critical temporal segments while maintaining computational efficiency. 3. Action: Agents answer long video-related questions and exchange reasons. 4. Reflection: We evaluate the performance of each agent in each round of discussion and optimize the agent team for dynamic collaboration. The agents iteratively refine their answers by multi-round dynamical collaboration of MLLM agents. LVAgent is the first agent system method that outperforms all closed-source models (including GPT-4o) and open-source models (including InternVL-2.5 and Qwen2-VL) in the long video understanding tasks. Our LVAgent achieves an accuracy of 80% on four mainstream long video understanding tasks. Notably, on the LongVideoBench dataset, LVAgent improves accuracy by up to 13.3% compared with SOTA.

- **[ALLVB: All-in-One Long Video Understanding Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07298)**  `arXiv:2503.07298`  `cs.CV`  
  _Xichen Tan, Yuanjing Luo, Yunfan Ye, Fang Liu, Zhiping Cai_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  From image to video understanding, the capabilities of Multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) are increasingly powerful. However, most existing video understanding benchmarks are relatively short, which makes them inadequate for effectively evaluating the long-sequence modeling capabilities of MLLMs. This highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive and integrated long video understanding benchmark to assess the ability of MLLMs thoroughly. To this end, we propose ALLVB (ALL-in-One Long Video Understanding Benchmark). ALLVB's main contributions include: 1) It integrates 9 major video understanding tasks. These tasks are converted into video QA formats, allowing a single benchmark to evaluate 9 different video understanding capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting the versatility, comprehensiveness, and challenging nature of ALLVB. 2) A fully automated annotation pipeline using GPT-4o is designed, requiring only human quality control, which facilitates the maintenance and expansion of the benchmark. 3) It contains 1,376 videos across 16 categories, averaging nearly 2 hours each, with a total of 252k QAs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest long video understanding benchmark in terms of the number of videos, average duration, and number of QAs. We have tested various mainstream MLLMs on ALLVB, and the results indicate that even the most advanced commercial models have significant room for improvement. This reflects the benchmark's challenging nature and demonstrates the substantial potential for development in long video understanding.

- **[Eliminating Position Bias of Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01100)**  `arXiv:2407.01100`  `cs.CL` `cs.LG`  
  _Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Based on the analyses, we propose to eliminate position bias (e.g., different retrieved documents' orders in QA affect performance) with a training-free zero-shot approach. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between documents and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of documents instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the document level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks, including LM-as-a-judge, retrieval-augmented QA, molecule generation, and math reasoning. Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains, making Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on the RewardBench reasoning set.

- **[SentenceKV: Efficient LLM Inference via Sentence-Level Semantic KV Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00970)**  `arXiv:2504.00970`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Yuxuan Zhu, Ali Falahati, David H. Yang, Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

- **[Token-Driven GammaTune: Adaptive Calibration for Enchanced Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00030)**  `arXiv:2504.00030`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Aayush Gautam, Susav Shrestha, Narasimha Annapareddy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.

  _Jixuan Leng, Chengsong Huang, Langlin Huang, Bill Yuchen Lin, William W. Cohen, Haohan Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly either assess text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles-a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in multiple formats (text and image) and offers different evaluation strategies ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs outperform non-reasoning models substantially by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings offer insights into the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.

- **[Zero-shot Benchmarking: A Framework for Flexible and Scalable Automatic Evaluation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01001)**  `arXiv:2504.01001`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Jos√© Pombal, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Ricardo Rei, Andr√© F. T. Martins_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As language models improve and become capable of performing more complex tasks across modalities, evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly challenging. Developing strong and robust task-specific automatic metrics gets harder, and human-annotated test sets -- which are expensive to create -- saturate more quickly. A compelling alternative is to design reliable strategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation, but previous attempts either rely on pre-existing data, or focus solely on individual tasks. We present Zero-shot Benchmarking (ZSB), a framework for creating high-quality benchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test data creation and evaluation. ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the creation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable to tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or impractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly challenging benchmarks as models improve. To assess the effectiveness of our framework, we create benchmarks for five text-only tasks and a multi-modal one: general capabilities in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Korean), translation, and general vision-language capabilities in English. We then rank a broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks. ZSB rankings consistently correlate strongly with human rankings, outperforming widely-adopted standard benchmarks. Through ablations, we find that strong benchmarks can be created with open models, and that judge model size and dataset variety are crucial drivers of performance. We release all our benchmarks, and code to reproduce our experiments and to produce new benchmarks.

- **[Digitally Supported Analysis of Spontaneous Speech (DigiSpon): Benchmarking NLP-Supported Language Sample Analysis of Swiss Children's Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00780)**  `arXiv:2504.00780`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI`  
  _Anja Ryser, Yingqiang Gao, Sarah Ebling_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language sample analysis (LSA) is a process that complements standardized psychometric tests for diagnosing, for example, developmental language disorder (DLD) in children. However, its labor-intensive nature has limited its use in speech-language pathology practice. We introduce an approach that leverages natural language processing (NLP) methods not based on commercial large language models (LLMs) applied to transcribed speech data from 119 children in the German speaking part of Switzerland with typical and atypical language development. The study aims to identify optimal practices that support speech-language pathologists in diagnosing DLD more efficiently within a human-in-the-loop framework, without relying on potentially unethical implementations that leverage commercial LLMs. Preliminary findings underscore the potential of integrating locally deployed NLP methods into the process of semi-automatic LSA.

- **[GenPRM: Scaling Test-Time Compute of Process Reward Models via Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00891)**  `arXiv:2504.00891`  `cs.CL`  
  _Jian Zhao, Runze Liu, Kaiyan Zhang, Zhimu Zhou, Junqi Gao, Dong Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that it is promising to utilize Process Reward Models (PRMs) as verifiers to enhance the performance of LLMs. However, current PRMs face three key challenges: (1) limited process supervision and generalization capabilities, (2) dependence on scalar value prediction without leveraging the generative abilities of LLMs, and (3) inability to scale the test-time compute of PRMs. In this work, we introduce GenPRM, a generative process reward model that performs explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with code verification before providing judgment for each reasoning step. To obtain high-quality process supervision labels and rationale data, we propose Relative Progress Estimation (RPE) and a rationale synthesis framework that incorporates code verification. Experimental results on ProcessBench and several mathematical reasoning tasks show that GenPRM significantly outperforms prior PRMs with only 23K training data from MATH dataset. Through test-time scaling, a 1.5B GenPRM outperforms GPT-4o, and a 7B GenPRM surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B on ProcessBench. Additionally, GenPRM demonstrates strong abilities to serve as a critic model for policy model refinement. This work establishes a new paradigm for process supervision that bridges the gap between PRMs and critic models in LLMs. Our code, model, and data will be available inthis https URL.

  _Weizhi Wang, Yu Tian, Linjie Yang, Heng Wang, Xifeng Yan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 442 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36\% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.

- **[TOMG-Bench: Evaluating LLMs on Text-based Open Molecule Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14642)**  `arXiv:2412.14642`  `cs.CL`  
  _Jiatong Li, Junxian Li, Yunqing Liu, Dongzhan Zhou, Qing Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose Text-based Open Molecule Generation Benchmark (TOMG-Bench), the first benchmark to evaluate the open-domain molecule generation capability of LLMs. TOMG-Bench encompasses a dataset of three major tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom). Each major task further contains three subtasks, while each subtask comprises 5,000 test samples. Given the inherent complexity of open molecule generation evaluation, we also developed an automated evaluation system that helps measure both the quality and the accuracy of the generated molecules. Our comprehensive benchmarking of 25 LLMs reveals the current limitations as well as potential areas for improvement in text-guided molecule discovery. Furthermore, we propose OpenMolIns, a specialized instruction tuning dataset established for solving challenges raised by TOMG-Bench. Fine-tuned on OpenMolIns, Llama3.1-8B could outperform all the open-source general LLMs, even surpassing GPT-3.5-turbo by 46.5\% on TOMG-Bench. Our codes and datasets are available throughthis https URL.

- **[Recitation over Reasoning: How Cutting-Edge Language Models Can Fail on Elementary School-Level Reasoning Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00509)**  `arXiv:2504.00509`  `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer $60\%$ performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current molecular understanding approaches predominantly focus on the descriptive aspect of human perception, providing broad, topic-level insights. However, the referential aspect -- linking molecular concepts to specific structural components -- remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a molecular grounding benchmark designed to evaluate a model's referential abilities. We align molecular grounding with established conventions in NLP, cheminformatics, and molecular science, showcasing the potential of NLP techniques to advance molecular understanding within the AI for Science movement. Furthermore, we constructed the largest molecular understanding benchmark to date, comprising 79k QA pairs, and developed a multi-agent grounding prototype as proof of concept. This system outperforms existing models, including GPT-4o, and its grounding outputs have been integrated to enhance traditional tasks such as molecular captioning and ATC (Anatomical, Therapeutic, Chemical) classification.

  _Davide Paglieri, Bart≈Çomiej Cupia≈Ç, Samuel Coward, Ulyana Piterbarg, Maciej Wolczyk, Akbir Khan, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) possess extensive knowledge and exhibit promising reasoning abilities, however, they still struggle to perform well in complex, dynamic environments. Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as several models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community. Code and Leaderboard atthis http URL.

  Smartphone agents are increasingly important for helping users control devices efficiently, with (Multimodal) Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches emerging as key contenders. Fairly comparing these agents is essential but challenging, requiring a varied task scope, the integration of agents with different implementations, and a generalisable evaluation pipeline to assess their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we present SPA-Bench, a comprehensive SmartPhone Agent Benchmark designed to evaluate (M)LLM-based agents in an interactive environment that simulates real-world conditions. SPA-Bench offers three key contributions: (1) A diverse set of tasks covering system and third-party apps in both English and Chinese, focusing on features commonly used in daily routines; (2) A plug-and-play framework enabling real-time agent interaction with Android devices, integrating over ten agents with the flexibility to add more; (3) A novel evaluation pipeline that automatically assesses agent performance across multiple dimensions, encompassing seven metrics related to task completion and resource consumption. Our extensive experiments across tasks and agents reveal challenges like interpreting mobile user interfaces, action grounding, memory retention, and execution costs. We propose future research directions to ease these difficulties, moving closer to real-world smartphone agent applications. SPA-Bench is available atthis https URL.
