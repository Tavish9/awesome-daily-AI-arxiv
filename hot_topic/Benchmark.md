- **[CORTEX-AVD: A Framework for CORner Case Testing and EXploration in Autonomous Vehicle Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03989)**  `arXiv:2504.03989`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) aim to improve traffic safety and efficiency by reducing human error. However, ensuring AVs reliability and safety is a challenging task when rare, high-risk traffic scenarios are considered. These 'Corner Cases' (CC) scenarios, such as unexpected vehicle maneuvers or sudden pedestrian crossings, must be safely and reliable dealt by AVs during their operations. But they arehard to be efficiently generated. Traditional CC generation relies on costly and risky real-world data acquisition, limiting scalability, and slowing research and development progress. Simulation-based techniques also face challenges, as modeling diverse scenarios and capturing all possible CCs is complex and time-consuming. To address these limitations in CC generation, this research introduces CORTEX-AVD, CORner Case Testing & EXploration for Autonomous Vehicles Development, an open-source framework that integrates the CARLA Simulator and Scenic to automatically generate CC from textual descriptions, increasing the diversity and automation of scenario modeling. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to optimize the scenario parameters in six case study scenarios, increasing the occurrence of high-risk events. Unlike previous methods, CORTEX-AVD incorporates a multi-factor fitness function that considers variables such as distance, time, speed, and collision likelihood. Additionally, the study provides a benchmark for comparing GA-based CC generation methods, contributing to a more standardized evaluation of synthetic data generation and scenario assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the CORTEX-AVD framework significantly increases CC incidence while reducing the proportion of wasted simulations.

- **[Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554)**  `arXiv:2504.07554`  `cs.RO`

  Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.

- **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045)**  `arXiv:2501.19045`  `cs.RO`  
  _Basant Sharma, Arun Kumar Singh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.

- **[Geometry-aware RL for Manipulation of Varying Shapes and Deformable Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07005)**  `arXiv:2502.07005`  `cs.LG` `cs.RO`  
  _Tai Hoang, Huy Le, Philipp Becker, Vien Anh Ngo, Gerhard Neumann_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.

- **[Distilling Knowledge from Heterogeneous Architectures for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07691)**  `arXiv:2504.07691`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Yanglin Huang, Kai Hu, Yuan Zhang, Zhineng Chen, Xieping Gao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current knowledge distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation focus on guiding the student to imitate the teacher's knowledge within homogeneous architectures. However, these methods overlook the diverse knowledge contained in architectures with different inductive biases, which is crucial for enabling the student to acquire a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the data during distillation. To this end, we propose for the first time a generic knowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous perspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between heterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring cross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the influence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of both the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits space. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous architectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a teacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student knowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are performed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between heterogeneous teacher-student knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on three main-stream benchmarks using various teacher-student pairs demonstrate that our HeteroAKD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in facilitating distillation between heterogeneous architectures.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length.To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Understanding Contrastive Representation Learning from Positive Unlabeled (PU) Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06038)**  `arXiv:2402.06038`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`  
  _Anish Acharya, Li Jing, Bhargav Bhushanam, Dhruv Choudhary, Michael Rabbat, Sujay Sanghavi, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretext Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL) followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has become a standard paradigm for learning with limited labels. We extend this approach to the Positive Unlabeled (PU) setting, where only a small set of labeled positives and a large unlabeled pool -- containing both positives and negatives are available. We study this problem under two regimes: (i) without access to the class prior, and (ii) when the prior is known or can be estimated. We introduce Positive Unlabeled Contrastive Learning (puCL), an unbiased and variance reducing contrastive objective that integrates weak supervision from labeled positives judiciously into the contrastive loss. When the class prior is known, we propose Positive Unlabeled InfoNCE (puNCE), a prior-aware extension that re-weights unlabeled samples as soft positive negative mixtures. For downstream classification, we develop a pseudo-labeling algorithm that leverages the structure of the learned embedding space via PU aware clustering. Our framework is supported by theory; offering bias-variance analysis, convergence insights, and generalization guarantees via augmentation concentration; and validated empirically across standard PU benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-supervision regimes.

- **[SpecReason: Fast and Accurate Inference-Time Compute via Speculative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07891)**  `arXiv:2504.07891`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Rui Pan, Yinwei Dai, Zhihao Zhang, Gabriele Oliaro, Zhihao Jia, Ravi Netravali_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, this improved accuracy comes at the cost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning sequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in tackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it embeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically broken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the semantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens it generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically accelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry out simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model only to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly, SpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in preserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation techniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level equivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason achieves 1.5-2.5$\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving accuracy by 1.0-9.9\%. Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason, their combination yields an additional 19.4-44.2\% latency reduction. We open-source SpecReason atthis https URL.

- **[ms-Mamba: Multi-scale Mamba for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07654)**  `arXiv:2504.07654`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yusuf Meric Karadag, Sinan Kalkan, Ipek Gursel Dino_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The problem of Time-series Forecasting is generally addressed by recurrent, Transformer-based and the recently proposed Mamba-based architectures. However, existing architectures generally process their input at a single temporal scale, which may be sub-optimal for many tasks where information changes over multiple time scales. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called Multi-scale Mamba (ms-Mamba) to address this gap. ms-Mamba incorporates multiple temporal scales by using multiple Mamba blocks with different sampling rates ($\Delta$s). Our experiments on many benchmarks demonstrate that ms-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including the recently proposed Transformer-based and Mamba-based models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Climate science studies the structure and dynamics of Earth's climate system and seeks to understand how climate changes over time, where the data is usually stored in the format of time series, recording the climate features, geolocation, time attributes, etc. Recently, much research attention has been paid to the climate benchmarks. In addition to the most common task of weather forecasting, several pioneering benchmark works are proposed for extending the modality, such as domain-specific applications like tropical cyclone intensity prediction and flash flood damage estimation, or climate statement and confidence level in the format of natural language. To further motivate the artificial general intelligence development for climate science, in this paper, we first contribute a multi-modal climate benchmark, i.e., ClimateBench-M, which aligns (1) the time series climate data from ERA5, (2) extreme weather events data from NOAA, and (3) satellite image data from NASA HLS based on a unified spatial-temporal granularity. Second, under each data modality, we also propose a simple but strong generative method that could produce competitive performance in weather forecasting, thunderstorm alerts, and crop segmentation tasks in the proposed ClimateBench-M. The data and code of ClimateBench-M are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[ChronoFormer: Time-Aware Transformer Architectures for Structured Clinical Event Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07373)**  `arXiv:2504.07373`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuanyun Zhang, Shi Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The temporal complexity of electronic health record (EHR) data presents significant challenges for predicting clinical outcomes using machine learning. This paper proposes ChronoFormer, an innovative transformer based architecture specifically designed to encode and leverage temporal dependencies in longitudinal patient data. ChronoFormer integrates temporal embeddings, hierarchical attention mechanisms, and domain specific masking techniques. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark tasks mortality prediction, readmission prediction, and long term comorbidity onset demonstrate substantial improvements over current state of the art methods. Furthermore, detailed analyses of attention patterns underscore ChronoFormer's capability to capture clinically meaningful long range temporal relationships.

- **[AMAD: AutoMasked Attention for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06643)**  `arXiv:2504.06643`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tiange Huang, Yongjun Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised multivariate time series anomaly detection (UMTSAD) plays a critical role in various domains, including finance, networks, and sensor systems. In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates \textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of datasets.

- **[GOLLuM: Gaussian Process Optimized LLMs -- Reframing LLM Finetuning through Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06265)**  `arXiv:2504.06265`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Bojana Rankoviƒá, Philippe Schwaller_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) can encode complex relationships in their latent spaces, yet harnessing them for optimization under uncertainty remains challenging. We address this gap with a novel architecture that reframes LLM finetuning as Gaussian process (GP) marginal likelihood optimization via deep kernel methods. We introduce LLM-based deep kernels, jointly optimized with GPs to preserve the benefits of both - LLMs to provide a rich and flexible input space for Bayesian optimization and - GPs to model this space with predictive uncertainty for more efficient sampling. Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features. Extensive empirical evaluation across 19 benchmarks - ranging from general chemistry to reaction and molecular property optimization - demonstrates our method's robustness, generality, and consistent improvements across: (1) tasks, (2) LLM architectures (encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder), (3) pretraining domains (chemistry-related or general-purpose) and (4) hyperparameter settings (tuned once on a single dataset). Finally, we explain these improvements: joint LLM-GP optimization through marginal likelihood implicitly performs contrastive learning, aligning representations to produce (1) better-structured embedding spaces, (2) improved uncertainty calibration, and (3) more efficient sampling - without requiring any external loss. This work provides both practical advances in sample-efficient optimization and insights into what makes effective Bayesian optimization.

- **[Finding Fantastic Experts in MoEs: A Unified Study for Expert Dropping Strategies and Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05586)**  `arXiv:2504.05586`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has shown promise in scaling up the learning capacity of neural networks. However, vanilla SMoEs have issues such as expert redundancy and heavy memory requirements, making them inefficient and non-scalable, especially for resource-constrained scenarios. Expert-level sparsification of SMoEs involves pruning the least important experts to address these limitations. In this work, we aim to address three questions: (1) What is the best recipe to identify the least knowledgeable subset of experts that can be dropped with minimal impact on performance? (2) How should we perform expert dropping (one-shot or iterative), and what correction measures can we undertake to minimize its drastic impact on SMoE subnetwork capabilities? (3) What capabilities of full-SMoEs are severely impacted by the removal of the least dominant experts, and how can we recover them? Firstly, we propose MoE Experts Compression Suite (MC-Suite), which is a collection of some previously explored and multiple novel recipes to provide a comprehensive benchmark for estimating expert importance from diverse perspectives, as well as unveil numerous valuable insights for SMoE experts. Secondly, unlike prior works with a one-shot expert pruning approach, we explore the benefits of iterative pruning with the re-estimation of the MC-Suite criterion. Moreover, we introduce the benefits of task-agnostic fine-tuning as a correction mechanism during iterative expert dropping, which we term MoE Lottery Subnetworks. Lastly, we present an experimentally validated conjecture that, during expert dropping, SMoEs' instruction-following capabilities are predominantly hurt, which can be restored to a robust level subject to external augmentation of instruction-following capabilities using k-shot examples and supervised fine-tuning.

  _Jakub Adamczyk, Jakub Poziemski, Pawel Siedlecki_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small molecules play a critical role in the biomedical, environmental, and agrochemical domains, each with distinct physicochemical requirements and success criteria. Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain.

- **[C3PO: Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization for Test-Time Expert Re-Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07964)**  `arXiv:2504.07964`  `cs.LG`  
  _Zhongyang Li, Ziyue Li, Tianyi Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from severely sub-optimal expert pathways-our study reveals that naive expert selection learned from pretraining leaves a surprising 10-20% accuracy gap for improvement. Motivated by this observation, we develop a novel class of test-time optimization methods to re-weight or "re-mixing" the experts in different layers jointly for each test sample. Since the test sample's ground truth is unknown, we propose to optimize a surrogate objective defined by the sample's "successful neighbors" from a reference set of samples. We introduce three surrogates and algorithms based on mode-finding, kernel regression, and the average loss of similar reference samples/tasks. To reduce the cost of optimizing whole pathways, we apply our algorithms merely to the core experts' mixing weights in critical layers, which enjoy similar performance but save significant computation. This leads to "Critical-Layer, Core-Expert, Collaborative Pathway Optimization (C3PO)". We apply C3PO to two recent MoE LLMs and examine it on six widely-used benchmarks. It consistently improves the base model by 7-15% in accuracy and outperforms widely used test-time learning baselines, e.g., in-context learning and prompt/prefix tuning, by a large margin. Moreover, C3PO enables MoE LLMs with 1-3B active parameters to outperform LLMs of 7-9B parameters, hence improving MoE's advantages on efficiency. Our thorough ablation study further sheds novel insights on achieving test-time improvement on MoE.

- **[Robust Hallucination Detection in LLMs via Adaptive Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07863)**  `arXiv:2504.07863`  `cs.LG`  
  _Mengjia Niu, Hamed Haddadi, Guansong Pang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

- **[Prototype-Based Continual Learning with Label-free Replay Buffer and Cluster Preservation Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07240)**  `arXiv:2504.07240`  `cs.LG`  
  _Agil Aghasanli, Yi Li, Plamen Angelov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning techniques employ simple replay sample selection processes and use them during subsequent tasks. Typically, they rely on labeled data. In this paper, we depart from this by automatically selecting prototypes stored without labels, preserving cluster structures in the latent space across tasks. By eliminating label dependence in the replay buffer and introducing cluster preservation loss, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can maintain essential information from previously encountered tasks while ensuring adaptation to new tasks. "Push-away" and "pull-toward" mechanisms over previously learned prototypes are also introduced for class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. These mechanisms ensure the retention of previously learned information as well as adaptation to new classes or domain shifts. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmarks, including SplitCIFAR100, SplitImageNet32, SplitTinyImageNet, and SplitCaltech256 for class-incremental, as well as R-MNIST and CORe50 for domain-incremental setting using pre-extracted DINOv2 features. Experimental results indicate that the label-free replay-based technique outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods and, in some cases, even surpasses offline learning. An unsupervised variant of the proposed technique for the class-incremental setting, avoiding labels use even on incoming data, also demonstrated competitive performance, outperforming particular supervised baselines in some cases. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in retaining prior information and facilitating continual adaptation.

  _Md Abrar Jahin, Shahriar Soudeep, M. F. Mridha, Raihan Kabir, Md Rashedul Islam, Yutaka Watanobe_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cybersecurity threats are growing, making network intrusion detection essential. Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.

- **[GOLD: Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection via Implicit Adversarial Latent Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05780)**  `arXiv:2502.05780`  `cs.LG`  
  _Danny Wang, Ruihong Qiu, Guangdong Bai, Zi Huang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling graph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a great challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Operator networks are designed to approximate nonlinear operators, which provide mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces such as function spaces. These networks are playing an increasingly important role in machine learning, with their most notable contributions in the field of scientific computing. Their significance stems from their ability to handle the type of data often encountered in scientific applications. For instance, in climate modeling or fluid dynamics, input data typically consists of discretized continuous fields (like temperature distributions or velocity fields). We introduce the radial basis operator network (RBON), which represents a significant advancement as the first operator network capable of learning an operator in both the time domain and frequency domain when adjusted to accept complex-valued inputs. Despite the small, single hidden-layer structure, the RBON boasts small $L^2$ relative test error for both in- and out-of-distribution data (OOD) of less than $1\times 10^{-7}$ in some benchmark cases. Moreover, the RBON maintains small error on OOD data from entirely different function classes from the training data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, camera-based solutions have been extensively explored for scene semantic completion (SSC). Despite their success in visible areas, existing methods struggle to capture complete scene semantics due to frequent visual occlusions. To address this limitation, this paper presents the first satellite-ground cooperative SSC framework, i.e., SGFormer, exploring the potential of satellite-ground image pairs in the SSC task. Specifically, we propose a dual-branch architecture that encodes orthogonal satellite and ground views in parallel, unifying them into a common domain. Additionally, we design a ground-view guidance strategy that corrects satellite image biases during feature encoding, addressing misalignment between satellite and ground views. Moreover, we develop an adaptive weighting strategy that balances contributions from satellite and ground views. Experiments demonstrate that SGFormer outperforms the state of the art on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Our code is available onthis https URL.

  Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its crucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with promising potential for applications in human communication and emotion analysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in micro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual differences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of micro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical Calibrating Ambiguous Network (PCAN) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of MAR. Firstly, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous sample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false negatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level categories. Secondly, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module to calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between ambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process aims to pull false negative (FN) samples closer to their respective prototypes and push false positive (FP) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In addition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to strengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different prototypes. Finally, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify prediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in multi-modal models have significantly improved vision-language alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning, rely on low-resolution images, and offer limited interpretability in attention mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce RadZero, a novel similarity-based cross-attention framework for vision-language alignment in radiology with zero-shot multi-task capability. RadZero leverages large language models to extract minimal semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs a multi-positive contrastive learning strategy to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It also utilizes a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, RadZero enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification and pixel-level cross-modal similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, cross-modal similarity map analysis highlights its potential for improving explainability in vision-language alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cartoon avatars have been widely used in various applications, including social media, online tutoring, and gaming. However, existing cartoon avatar datasets and generation methods struggle to present highly expressive avatars with fine-grained facial expressions and are often inspired from real-world identities, raising privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with fine-grained facial expressions. Our approach fine-tunes a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize highly detailed and expressive facial expressions. We then incorporate a stylization model that transforms these realistic faces into cartoon avatars while preserving both identity and expression. Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive cartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135 fine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars with a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL. We also verify that the cartoon avatars generated by our framework do not include memorized identities from fine-tuning data. The proposed framework and dataset provide a diverse and expressive benchmark for future research in cartoon avatar generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

  Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have witnessed substantial advancements in recent years, propelled by the advancement in multi-modal LLMs. Although these models have demonstrated proficiency in providing the overall description of videos, they struggle with fine-grained understanding, particularly in aspects such as visual dynamics and video details inquiries. To tackle these shortcomings, we find that fine-tuning Video-LLMs on self-supervised fragment tasks, greatly improve their fine-grained video understanding abilities. Hence we propose two key contributions:(1) Self-Supervised Fragment Fine-Tuning (SF$^2$T), a novel effortless fine-tuning method, employs the rich inherent characteristics of videos for training, while unlocking more fine-grained understanding ability of Video-LLMs. Moreover, it relieves researchers from labor-intensive annotations and smartly circumvents the limitations of natural language, which often fails to capture the complex spatiotemporal variations in videos; (2) A novel benchmark dataset, namely FineVidBench, for rigorously assessing Video-LLMs' performance at both the scene and fragment levels, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities. We assessed multiple models and validated the effectiveness of SF$^2$T on them. Experimental results reveal that our approach improves their ability to capture and interpret spatiotemporal details.

  The segmentation of multiple organs in multi-parametric MRI studies is critical for many applications in radiology, such as correlating imaging biomarkers with disease status (e.g., cirrhosis, diabetes). Recently, three publicly available tools, such as MRSegmentator (MRSeg), TotalSegmentator MRI (TS), and TotalVibeSegmentator (VIBE), have been proposed for multi-organ segmentation in MRI. However, the performance of these tools on specific MRI sequence types has not yet been quantified. In this work, a subset of 40 volumes from the public Duke Liver Dataset was curated. The curated dataset contained 10 volumes each from the pre-contrast fat saturated T1, arterial T1w, venous T1w, and delayed T1w phases, respectively. Ten abdominal structures were manually annotated in these volumes. Next, the performance of the three public tools was benchmarked on this curated dataset. The results indicated that MRSeg obtained a Dice score of 80.7 $\pm$ 18.6 and Hausdorff Distance (HD) error of 8.9 $\pm$ 10.4 mm. It fared the best ($p < .05$) across the different sequence types in contrast to TS and VIBE.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum, which is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain, snow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce FAIR-SIGHT, an innovative post-hoc framework designed to ensure fairness in computer vision systems by combining conformal prediction with a dynamic output repair mechanism. Our approach calculates a fairness-aware non-conformity score that simultaneously assesses prediction errors and fairness violations. Using conformal prediction, we establish an adaptive threshold that provides rigorous finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. When the non-conformity score for a new image exceeds the calibrated threshold, FAIR-SIGHT implements targeted corrective adjustments, such as logit shifts for classification and confidence recalibration for detection, to reduce both group and individual fairness disparities, all without the need for retraining or having access to internal model parameters. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates our method's error control and convergence properties. At the same time, extensive empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that FAIR-SIGHT significantly reduces fairness disparities while preserving high predictive performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) answers clinical questions using medical images, aiding diagnosis. Designing the MedVQA system holds profound importance in assisting clinical diagnosis and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Building upon this foundation, Hierarchical Medical VQA extends Medical VQA by organizing medical questions into a hierarchical structure and making level-specific predictions to handle fine-grained distinctions. Recently, many studies have proposed hierarchical MedVQA tasks and established datasets, However, several issues still remain: (1) imperfect hierarchical modeling leads to poor differentiation between question levels causing semantic fragmentation across hierarchies. (2) Excessive reliance on implicit learning in Transformer-based cross-modal self-attention fusion methods, which obscures crucial local semantic correlations in medical scenarios. To address these issues, this study proposes a HiCA-VQA method, including two modules: Hierarchical Prompting for fine-grained medical questions and Hierarchical Answer Decoders. The hierarchical prompting module pre-aligns hierarchical text prompts with image features to guide the model in focusing on specific image regions according to question types, while the hierarchical decoder performs separate predictions for questions at different levels to improve accuracy across granularities. The framework also incorporates a cross-attention fusion module where images serve as queries and text as key-value pairs. Experiments on the Rad-Restruct benchmark demonstrate that the HiCA-VQA framework better outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in answering hierarchical fine-grained questions. This study provides an effective pathway for hierarchical visual question answering systems, advancing medical image understanding.

  Ensuring adherence to traffic sign regulations is essential for both human and autonomous vehicle navigation. While current online mapping solutions often prioritize the construction of the geometric and connectivity layers of HD maps, overlooking the construction of the traffic regulation layer within HD maps. Addressing this gap, we introduce MapDR, a novel dataset designed for the extraction of Driving Rules from traffic signs and their association with vectorized, locally perceived HD Maps. MapDR features over $10,000$ annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes. Built upon this benchmark and the newly defined task of integrating traffic regulations into online HD maps, we provide modular and end-to-end solutions: VLE-MEE and RuleVLM, offering a strong baseline for advancing autonomous driving technology. It fills a critical gap in the integration of traffic sign rules, contributing to the development of reliable autonomous driving systems. Code is available atthis https URL.

  We present PixelFlow, a family of image generation models that operate directly in the raw pixel space, in contrast to the predominant latent-space models. This approach simplifies the image generation process by eliminating the need for a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and enabling the whole model end-to-end trainable. Through efficient cascade flow modeling, PixelFlow achieves affordable computation cost in pixel space. It achieves an FID of 1.98 on 256$\times$256 ImageNet class-conditional image generation benchmark. The qualitative text-to-image results demonstrate that PixelFlow excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control.

  _Lang Lin, Xueyang Yu, Ziqi Pang, Yu-Xiong Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a novel framework utilizing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for referring video object segmentation (RefVOS). Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between "Ref" and "VOS": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse "context frames" provides global information, while a stream of continuous "query frames" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

  We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for monocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic prior captured by such video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, depth, and ray maps. It uses a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as multiple sliding windows, at inference time, thus obtaining robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods, including recent methods such as MonST3R, which are also designed to handle dynamic scenes.

  The Instruction Following (IF) ability measures how well Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand exactly what users are telling them and whether they are doing it right. Existing multimodal instruction following training data is scarce, the benchmarks are simple with atomic instructions, and the evaluation strategies are imprecise for tasks demanding exact output constraints. To address this, we present MM-IFEngine, an effective pipeline to generate high-quality image-instruction pairs. Our MM-IFEngine pipeline yields large-scale, diverse, and high-quality training data MM-IFInstruct-23k, which is suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and extended as MM-IFDPO-23k for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We further introduce MM-IFEval, a challenging and diverse multi-modal instruction-following benchmark that includes (1) both compose-level constraints for output responses and perception-level constraints tied to the input images, and (2) a comprehensive evaluation pipeline incorporating both rule-based assessment and judge model. We conduct SFT and DPO experiments and demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs on MM-IFInstruct-23k and MM-IFDPO-23k achieves notable gains on various IF benchmarks, such as MM-IFEval (+10.2$\%$), MIA (+7.6$\%$), and IFEval (+12.3$\%$).

  3D part amodal segmentation--decomposing a 3D shape into complete, semantically meaningful parts, even when occluded--is a challenging but crucial task for 3D content creation and understanding. Existing 3D part segmentation methods only identify visible surface patches, limiting their utility. Inspired by 2D amodal segmentation, we introduce this novel task to the 3D domain and propose a practical, two-stage approach, addressing the key challenges of inferring occluded 3D geometry, maintaining global shape consistency, and handling diverse shapes with limited training data. First, we leverage existing 3D part segmentation to obtain initial, incomplete part segments. Second, we introduce HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model, to complete these segments into full 3D parts. HoloPart utilizes a specialized architecture with local attention to capture fine-grained part geometry and global shape context attention to ensure overall shape consistency. We introduce new benchmarks based on the ABO and PartObjaverse-Tiny datasets and demonstrate that HoloPart significantly outperforms state-of-the-art shape completion methods. By incorporating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, we achieve promising results on 3D part amodal segmentation, opening new avenues for applications in geometry editing, animation, and material assignment.

  Current Few Shot Segmentation literature lacks a mask selection method that goes beyond visual similarity between the query and example images, leading to suboptimal predictions. We present MARS, a plug-and-play ranking system that leverages multimodal cues to filter and merge mask proposals robustly. Starting from a set of mask predictions for a single query image, we score, filter, and merge them to improve results. Proposals are evaluated using multimodal scores computed at local and global levels. Extensive experiments on COCO-20i, Pascal-5i, LVIS-92i, and FSS-1000 demonstrate that integrating all four scoring components is crucial for robust ranking, validating our contribution. As MARS can be effortlessly integrated with various mask proposal systems, we deploy it across a wide range of top-performer methods and achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple existing benchmarks. Code will be available upon acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present an effective method to enhance visual reasoning with significantly fewer training samples, relying purely on self-improvement with no knowledge distillation. Our key insight is that the difficulty of training data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical. Appropriately challenging samples can substantially boost reasoning capabilities even when the dataset is small. Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in accurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering. To this end, we propose a novel way of repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to achieve that. Starting from our curated 70k open-source training samples, we introduce an MCTS-based selection method that quantifies sample difficulty based on the number of iterations required by the VLMs to solve each problem. This explicit step-by-step reasoning in MCTS enforces the model to think longer and better identifies samples that are genuinely challenging. We filter and retain 11k samples to perform RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, resulting in our final model, ThinkLite-VL. Evaluation results on eight benchmarks show that ThinkLite-VL improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7%, using only 11k training samples with no knowledge distillation. This significantly outperforms all existing 7B-level reasoning VLMs, and our fairly comparable baselines that use classic selection methods such as accuracy-based filtering. Notably, on MathVista, ThinkLite-VL-7B achieves the SoTA accuracy of 75.1, surpassing Qwen2.5-VL-72B, GPT-4o, and O1. Our code, data, and model are available atthis https URL.

  Gait recognition from video streams is a challenging problem in computer vision biometrics due to the subtle differences between gaits and numerous confounding factors. Recent advancements in self-supervised pretraining have led to the development of robust gait recognition models that are invariant to walking covariates. While neural scaling laws have transformed model development in other domains by linking performance to data, model size, and compute, their applicability to gait remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study scaling on skeleton-based self-supervised gait recognition to quantify the effect of data quantity, model size and compute on downstream gait recognition performance. We pretrain multiple variants of GaitPT - a transformer-based architecture - on a dataset of 2.7 million walking sequences collected in the wild. We evaluate zero-shot performance across four benchmark datasets to derive scaling laws for data, model size, and compute. Our findings demonstrate predictable power-law improvements in performance with increased scale and confirm that data and compute scaling significantly influence downstream accuracy. We further isolate architectural contributions by comparing GaitPT with GaitFormer under controlled compute budgets. These results provide practical insights into resource allocation and performance estimation for real-world gait recognition systems.

  Monocular 3D occupancy prediction, aiming to predict the occupancy and semantics within interesting regions of 3D scenes from only 2D images, has garnered increasing attention recently for its vital role in 3D scene understanding. Predicting the 3D occupancy of large-scale outdoor scenes from 2D images is ill-posed and resource-intensive. In this paper, we present \textbf{DGOcc}, a \textbf{D}epth-aware \textbf{G}lobal query-based network for monocular 3D \textbf{Occ}upancy prediction. We first explore prior depth maps to extract depth context features that provide explicit geometric information for the occupancy network. Then, in order to fully exploit the depth context features, we propose a Global Query-based (GQ) Module. The cooperation of attention mechanisms and scale-aware operations facilitates the feature interaction between images and 3D voxels. Moreover, a Hierarchical Supervision Strategy (HSS) is designed to avoid upsampling the high-dimension 3D voxel features to full resolution, which mitigates GPU memory utilization and time cost. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best performance on monocular semantic occupancy prediction while reducing GPU and time overhead.

- **[Event Signal Filtering via Probability Flux Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07503)**  `arXiv:2504.07503`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Events offer a novel paradigm for capturing scene dynamics via asynchronous sensing, but their inherent randomness often leads to degraded signal quality. Event signal filtering is thus essential for enhancing fidelity by reducing this internal randomness and ensuring consistent outputs across diverse acquisition conditions. Unlike traditional time series that rely on fixed temporal sampling to capture steady-state behaviors, events encode transient dynamics through polarity and event intervals, making signal modeling significantly more complex. To address this, the theoretical foundation of event generation is revisited through the lens of diffusion processes. The state and process information within events is modeled as continuous probability flux at threshold boundaries of the underlying irradiance diffusion. Building on this insight, a generative, online filtering framework called Event Density Flow Filter (EDFilter) is introduced. EDFilter estimates event correlation by reconstructing the continuous probability flux from discrete events using nonparametric kernel smoothing, and then resamples filtered events from this flux. To optimize fidelity over time, spatial and temporal kernels are employed in a time-varying optimization framework. A fast recursive solver with O(1) complexity is proposed, leveraging state-space models and lookup tables for efficient likelihood computation. Furthermore, a new real-world benchmark Rotary Event Dataset (RED) is released, offering microsecond-level ground truth irradiance for full-reference event filtering evaluation. Extensive experiments validate EDFilter's performance across tasks like event filtering, super-resolution, and direct event-based blob tracking. Significant gains in downstream applications such as SLAM and video reconstruction underscore its robustness and effectiveness.

  We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), this model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities. It achieves scores of 61.7 on MMMU, 36.8 on MathVision, and 71.3 on MathVista while maintaining the compact 2.8B activated LLM parameters, setting a new standard for efficient multimodal thinking models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose DLTPose, a novel method for 6DoF object pose estimation from RGB-D images that combines the accuracy of sparse keypoint methods with the robustness of dense pixel-wise predictions. DLTPose predicts per-pixel radial distances to a set of minimally four keypoints, which are then fed into our novel Direct Linear Transform (DLT) formulation to produce accurate 3D object frame surface estimates, leading to better 6DoF pose estimation. Additionally, we introduce a novel symmetry-aware keypoint ordering approach, designed to handle object symmetries that otherwise cause inconsistencies in keypoint assignments. Previous keypoint-based methods relied on fixed keypoint orderings, which failed to account for the multiple valid configurations exhibited by symmetric objects, which our ordering approach exploits to enhance the model's ability to learn stable keypoint representations. Extensive experiments on the benchmark LINEMOD, Occlusion LINEMOD and YCB-Video datasets show that DLTPose outperforms existing methods, especially for symmetric and occluded objects, demonstrating superior Mean Average Recall values of 86.5% (LM), 79.7% (LM-O) and 89.5% (YCB-V).

  Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

  Landmark detection plays a crucial role in medical imaging tasks that rely on precise spatial localization, including specific applications in diagnosis, treatment planning, image registration, and surgical navigation. However, manual annotation is labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge. While deep learning shows promise in automating this task, progress is hindered by limited public datasets, inconsistent benchmarks, and non-standardized baselines, restricting reproducibility, fair comparisons, and model generalizability. This work introduces nnLandmark, a self-configuring deep learning framework for 3D medical landmark detection, adapting nnU-Net to perform heatmap-based regression. By leveraging nnU-Net's automated configuration, nnLandmark eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, offering out-of-the-box usability. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across two public datasets, with a mean radial error (MRE) of 1.5 mm on the Mandibular Molar Landmark (MML) dental CT dataset and 1.2 mm for anatomical fiducials on a brain MRI dataset (AFIDs), where nnLandmark aligns with the inter-rater variability of 1.5 mm. With its strong generalization, reproducibility, and ease of deployment, nnLandmark establishes a reliable baseline for 3D landmark detection, supporting research in anatomical localization and clinical workflows that depend on precise landmark identification. The code will be available soon.

  Safety constitutes a foundational imperative for autonomous driving systems, necessitating the maximal incorporation of accessible external prior information. This study establishes that temporal perception buffers and cost-efficient maps inherently form complementary prior sources for online vectorized high-definition (HD) map construction. We present Uni-PrevPredMap, a unified prior-informed framework that systematically integrates two synergistic information sources: previous predictions and simulated outdated HD maps. The framework introduces two core innovations: a tile-indexed 3D vectorized global map processor enabling efficient refreshment, storage, and retrieval of 3D vectorized priors; a tri-mode operational optimization paradigm ensuring consistency across non-prior, temporal-prior, and temporal-map-fusion-prior scenarios while mitigating reliance on idealized map fidelity assumptions. Uni-PrevPredMap achieves state-of-the-art performance in map-absent scenarios across established online vectorized HD map construction benchmarks. When provided with simulated outdated HD maps, the framework exhibits robust capabilities in error-resilient prior fusion, empirically confirming the synergistic complementarity between previous predictions and simulated outdated HD maps.

  The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.

  Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) addresses the limitations of single-modality data by integrating complementary information across modalities. Despite notable progress, a significant gap persists between research and real-world deployment due to variability and uncertainty in multi-modal data quality. Robustness has thus become essential for practical MMSS applications. However, the absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating robustness hinders further advancement. To address this, we first survey existing MMSS literature and categorize representative methods to provide a structured overview. We then introduce a robustness benchmark that evaluates MMSS models under three scenarios: Entire-Missing Modality (EMM), Random-Missing Modality (RMM), and Noisy Modality (NM). From a probabilistic standpoint, we model modality failure under two conditions: (1) all damaged combinations are equally probable; (2) each modality fails independently following a Bernoulli distribution. Based on these, we propose four metrics-$mIoU^{Avg}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{E}_{EMM}$, $mIoU^{Avg}_{RMM}$, and $mIoU^{E}_{RMM}$-to assess model robustness under EMM and RMM. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark for MMSS robustness, offering new insights and tools to advance the field. Source code is available atthis https URL.

  Text-to-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to retrieve relevant videos based on textual queries. However, as video content evolves continuously, adapting TVR systems to new data remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for Continual Text-to-Video Retrieval (CTVR) to address the limitations of existing approaches. Current Pre-Trained Model (PTM)-based TVR methods struggle with maintaining model plasticity when adapting to new tasks, while existing Continual Learning (CL) methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to semantic misalignment between historical queries and stored video features. To address these two challenges, we propose FrameFusionMoE, a novel CTVR framework that comprises two key components: (1) the Frame Fusion Adapter (FFA), which captures temporal video dynamics while preserving model plasticity, and (2) the Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (TAME), which ensures consistent semantic alignment between queries across tasks and the stored video features. Thus, FrameFusionMoE enables effective adaptation to new video content while preserving historical text-video relevance to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We comprehensively evaluate FrameFusionMoE on two benchmark datasets under various task settings. Results demonstrate that FrameFusionMoE outperforms existing CL and TVR methods, achieving superior retrieval performance with minimal degradation on earlier tasks when handling continuous video streams.

  Recent advancements in image-text matching have been notable, yet prevailing models predominantly cater to broad queries and struggle with accommodating fine-grained query intention. In this paper, we work towards the \textbf{E}ntity-centric \textbf{I}mage-\textbf{T}ext \textbf{M}atching (EITM), a task that the text and image involve specific entity-related information. The challenge of this task mainly lies in the larger semantic gap in entity association modeling, comparing with the general image-text matchingthis http URLnarrow the huge semantic gap between the entity-centric text and the images, we take the fundamental CLIP as the backbone and devise a multimodal attentive contrastive learning framework to tam CLIP to adapt EITM problem, developing a model named EntityCLIP. The key of our multimodal attentive contrastive learning is to generate interpretive explanation text using Large Language Models (LLMs) as the bridge clues. In specific, we proceed by extracting explanatory text from off-the-shelf LLMs. This explanation text, coupled with the image and text, is then input into our specially crafted Multimodal Attentive Experts (MMAE) module, which effectively integrates explanation texts to narrow the gap of the entity-related text and image in a shared semantic space. Building on the enriched features derived from MMAE, we further design an effective Gated Integrative Image-text Matching (GI-ITM) strategy. The GI-ITM employs an adaptive gating mechanism to aggregate MMAE's features, subsequently applying image-text matching constraints to steer the alignment between the text and the image. Extensive experiments are conducted on three social media news benchmarks including N24News, VisualNews, and GoodNews, the results shows that our method surpasses the competition methods with a clear margin.

  We present the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. We quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, we find that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.

  Safe navigation of self-driving cars and robots requires a precise understanding of their environment. Training data for perception systems cannot cover the wide variety of objects that may appear during deployment. Thus, reliable identification of unknown objects, such as wild animals and untypical obstacles, is critical due to their potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been facilitated by the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks. However, a comprehensive understanding of scene dynamics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Development in this area has been lagging, largely due to the lack of dedicated benchmarks. The situation is similar in object detection. While there is interest in detecting and potentially tracking every anomalous object, the availability of dedicated benchmarks is clearly limited. To address this gap, this work extends some commonly used anomaly segmentation benchmarks to include the instance segmentation and object detection tasks. Our evaluation of anomaly instance segmentation and object detection methods shows that both of these challenges remain unsolved problems.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations. SCARF is available at GitHub repository.

  AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.

  Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, driving advancements in machine translation, summarization, and conversational agents. However, their increasing integration into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and compromise fairness. These biases stem from various sources, including historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased responses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i) systematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases across various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of model responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in both small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety. Additionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for critical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability benchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and safety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language models.

  We present Pangu Ultra, a Large Language Model (LLM) with 135 billion parameters and dense Transformer modules trained on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs). Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during post-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize 8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on multiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances the state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral Large 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse model structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates that Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense models with more than 100 billion parameters.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Meta learning has been widely used to exploit rich-resource source tasks to improve the performance of low-resource target tasks. Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.

  The globalization of social interactions has heightened the need for machine translation (MT) on Social Network Services (SNS), yet traditional models struggle with culturally nuanced content like memes, slang, and pop culture references. While large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose translation, their performance on SNS-specific content remains limited due to insufficient specialized training data and evaluation benchmarks. This paper introduces RedTrans, a 72B LLM tailored for SNS translation, trained on a novel dataset developed through three innovations: (1) Supervised Finetuning with Dual-LLM Back-Translation Sampling, an unsupervised sampling method using LLM-based back-translation to select diverse data for large-scale finetuning; (2) Rewritten Preference Optimization (RePO), an algorithm that identifies and corrects erroneous preference pairs through expert annotation, building reliable preference corpora; and (3) RedTrans-Bench, the first benchmark for SNS translation, evaluating phenomena like humor localization, emoji semantics, and meme adaptation. Experiments show RedTrans outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs. Besides, RedTrans has already been deployed in a real-world production environment, demonstrating that domain-specific adaptation, effectively bridges the gap between generic and culturally grounded translation systems.

  Common-sense reasoning is a key language model capability because it encapsulates not just specific factual knowledge but rather general language and world understanding. Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is crucial for language models of different sizes and applications. One of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag; however, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues. These issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading prompts or equally correct options. Furthermore, we show that if models are evaluated only on answer texts, or with "Lorem ipsum dolor..." instead of the question, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot be attributed merely to contamination. Since benchmark scores are an essential part of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these validity issues can have severe consequences. In particular, knowing that taking benchmark scores at face value is ubiquitous, inadequate evaluation leads to ill-informed decisions about models. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate critical validity issues posed by HellaSwag and illustrate them with various evaluations using generative language models of different sizes. We argue that this benchmark does not accurately measure common-sense reasoning and, therefore, should not be used for evaluation in its current state. Based on the results of our study, we propose requirements that should be met by future common-sense reasoning benchmarks. In addition, we release GoldenSwag, a corrected subset of HellaSwag, which, to our belief, facilitates acceptable common-sense reasoning evaluation.

  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) with sparse activation of task-specific experts. Despite their computational efficiency during inference, the massive overall parameter footprint of MoE models (e.g., GPT-4) introduces critical challenges for practical deployment. Current pruning approaches often fail to address two inherent characteristics of MoE systems: 1).intra-layer expert homogeneity where experts within the same MoE layer exhibit functional redundancy, and 2). inter-layer similarity patterns where deeper layers tend to contain progressively more homogeneous experts. To tackle these issues, we propose Cluster-driven Expert Pruning (C-Prune), a novel two-stage framework for adaptive task-specific compression of MoE LLMs. C-Prune operates through layer-wise expert clustering, which groups functionally similar experts within each MoE layer using parameter similarity metrics, followed by global cluster pruning, which eliminates redundant clusters across all layers through a unified importance scoring mechanism that accounts for cross-layer homogeneity. We validate C-Prune through extensive experiments on multiple MoE models and benchmarks. The results demonstrate that C-Prune effectively reduces model size while outperforming existing MoE pruning methods.

  In this document, we discuss a multi-step approach to automated construction of a knowledge graph, for structuring and representing domain-specific knowledge from large document corpora. We apply our method to build the first knowledge graph of nuclear fusion energy, a highly specialized field characterized by vast scope and heterogeneity. This is an ideal benchmark to test the key features of our pipeline, including automatic named entity recognition and entity resolution. We show how pre-trained large language models can be used to address these challenges and we evaluate their performance against Zipf's law, which characterizes human-generated natural language. Additionally, we develop a knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation system that combines large language models with a multi-prompt approach. This system provides contextually relevant answers to natural-language queries, including complex multi-hop questions that require reasoning across interconnected entities.

  The Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) task focuses on detecting and correcting spelling errors in sentences. Current research primarily explores two approaches: traditional multimodal pre-trained models and large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs face limitations in CSC, particularly over-correction, making them suboptimal for this task. While existing studies have investigated the use of phonetic and graphemic information in multimodal CSC models, effectively leveraging these features to enhance correction performance remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Multimodal Analysis for Character Usage (\textbf{MACU}) experiment, identifying potential improvements for multimodal correctison. Based on empirical findings, we introduce \textbf{NamBert}, a novel multimodal model for Chinese spelling correction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate NamBert's superiority over SOTA methods. We also conduct a comprehensive comparison between NamBert and LLMs, systematically evaluating their strengths and limitations in CSC. Our code and model are available atthis https URL.

  In this work, we establish a novel theoretical connection between supervised fine-tuning and offline reinforcement learning under the token-level Markov decision process, revealing that large language models indeed learn an implicit $Q$-function for inference. Through this theoretical lens, we demonstrate that the widely used beam search method suffers from unacceptable over-optimism, where inference errors are inevitably amplified due to inflated $Q$-value estimations of suboptimal steps. To address this limitation, we propose Supervised Optimism Correction(SOC), which introduces a simple yet effective auxiliary loss for token-level $Q$-value estimations during supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, the auxiliary loss employs implicit value regularization to boost model confidence in expert-demonstrated responses, thereby suppressing over-optimism toward insufficiently supervised responses. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH, and GAOKAO, showcase the superiority of the proposed SOC with beam search across a series of open-source models.

  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly promoted the development of code generation task, sparking a surge in pertinent literature. Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce AgentAda, the first LLM-powered analytics agent that can learn and use new analytics skills to extract more specialized insights. Unlike existing methods that require users to manually decide which data analytics method to apply, AgentAda automatically identifies the skill needed from a library of analytical skills to perform the analysis. This also allows AgentAda to use skills that existing LLMs cannot perform out of the box. The library covers a range of methods, including clustering, predictive modeling, and NLP techniques like BERT, which allow AgentAda to handle complex analytics tasks based on what the user needs. AgentAda's dataset-to-insight extraction strategy consists of three key steps: (I) a question generator to generate queries relevant to the user's goal and persona, (II) a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based skill matcher to choose the best data analytics skill from the skill library, and (III) a code generator that produces executable code based on the retrieved skill's documentation to extract key patterns. We also introduce KaggleBench, a benchmark of curated notebooks across diverse domains, to evaluate AgentAda's performance. We conducted a human evaluation demonstrating that AgentAda provides more insightful analytics than existing tools, with 48.78% of evaluators preferring its analyses, compared to 27.67% for the unskilled agent. We also propose a novel LLM-as-a-judge approach that we show is aligned with human evaluation as a way to automate insight quality evaluation at larger scale.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied across various tasks, instruction tuning has emerged as a critical method for enhancing model performance. However, current data management strategies face substantial challenges in generating diverse and comprehensive data, restricting further improvements in model performance. To address this gap, we propose MDIT, a novel model-free data interpolation method for diverse instruction tuning, which generates varied and high-quality instruction data by performing task interpolation. Moreover, it contains diversity-based clustering strategies to ensure the diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in multiple benchmark tasks. The LLMs finetuned with MDIT show significant improvements in numerous tasks such as general question answering, math reasoning, and code generation. MDIT offers an efficient and automatic data synthetic method, generating diverse instruction data without depending on external resources while expanding the application potential of LLMs in complex environments.

  The diversity of human language, shaped by social, cultural, and regional influences, presents significant challenges for natural language processing (NLP) systems. Existing benchmarks often overlook intra-language variations, leaving speakers of non-standard dialects underserved. To address this gap, we introduce EnDive (English Diversity), a benchmark that evaluates five widely-used large language models (LLMs) across tasks in language understanding, algorithmic reasoning, mathematics, and logic. Our framework translates Standard American English datasets into five underrepresented dialects using few-shot prompting with verified examples from native speakers, and compare these translations against rule-based methods via fluency assessments, preference tests, and semantic similarity metrics. Human evaluations confirm high translation quality, with average scores of at least 6.02/7 for faithfulness, fluency, and formality. By filtering out near-identical translations, we create a challenging dataset that reveals significant performance disparities - models consistently underperform on dialectal inputs compared to Standard American English. EnDive thus advances dialect-aware NLP by uncovering model biases and promoting more equitable language technologies.

  Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 scores 90.5% on ChartQA but only 55.81% on ChartQAPro, underscoring the complexity of chart reasoning. We complement our findings with detailed error analyses and ablation studies, identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing LVLMs in chart understanding and reasoning. We release ChartQAPro atthis https URL.

  Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited an impressive capability to perform reasoning tasks, especially if they are encouraged to generate a sequence of intermediate steps. Reasoning performance can be improved by suitably combining multiple LLM responses, generated either in parallel in a single query, or via sequential interactions with LLMs throughout the reasoning process. Existing strategies for combination, such as self-consistency and progressive-hint-prompting, make inefficient usage of the LLM responses. We present Refined Answer Distributions, a novel and principled algorithmic framework to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our approach can be viewed as an iterative sampling strategy for forming a Monte Carlo approximation of an underlying distribution of answers, with the goal of identifying the mode -- the most likely answer. Empirical evaluation on several reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.

  Unsupervised commonsense reasoning (UCR) is becoming increasingly popular as the construction of commonsense reasoning datasets is expensive, and they are inevitably limited in their scope. A popular approach to UCR is to fine-tune language models with external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs), but this usually requires a large number of training examples. In this paper, we propose to transform the downstream multiple choice question answering task into a simpler binary classification task by ranking all candidate answers according to their reasonableness. To this end, for training the model, we convert the knowledge graph triples into reasonable and unreasonable texts. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach on various multiple choice question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, compared with existing UCR approaches using KGs, ours is less data hungry. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of episodic reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop episodic reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models with human preferences is crucial for their safe deployment. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO methods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment requires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability, establishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and interpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available atthis http URL.

  Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website:this https URL
