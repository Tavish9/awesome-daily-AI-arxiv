- **[RoboArena: Distributed Real-World Evaluation of Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18123)**  `arXiv:2506.18123`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`  
  _Pranav Atreya, Karl Pertsch, Tony Lee, Moo Jin Kim, Arhan Jain, Artur Kuramshin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.

- **[Reproducible Evaluation of Camera Auto-Exposure Methods in the Field: Platform, Benchmark and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18844)**  `arXiv:2506.18844`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images. Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

- **[General-Purpose Robotic Navigation via LVLM-Orchestrated Perception, Reasoning, and Acting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17462)**  `arXiv:2506.17462`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV`

  Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed input representations, or pre-existing maps.

  Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

- **[MinD: Unified Visual Imagination and Control via Hierarchical World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897)**  `arXiv:2506.18897`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation. However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.

  Reliable navigation in unstructured, real-world environments remains a significant challenge for embodied agents, especially when operating across diverse terrains, weather conditions, and sensor configurations. In this paper, we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment. GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2 with a novel path fusion strategy that enhances planning stability in noisy and ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.

- **[Context-Aware Human Behavior Prediction Using Multimodal Large Language Models: Challenges and Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00839)**  `arXiv:2504.00839`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Yuchen Liu, Lino Lerch, Luigi Palmieri, Andrey Rudenko, Sebastian Koch, Timo Ropinski, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting human behavior in shared environments is crucial for safe and efficient human-robot interaction. Traditional data-driven methods to that end are pre-trained on domain-specific datasets, activity types, and prediction horizons. In contrast, the recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise open-ended cross-domain generalization to describe various human activities and make predictions in any context. In particular, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are able to integrate information from various sources, achieving more contextual awareness and improved scene understanding. The difficulty in applying general-purpose MLLMs directly for prediction stems from their limited capacity for processing large input sequences, sensitivity to prompt design, and expensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of applying pre-trained MLLMs for context-aware human behavior prediction. To this end, we introduce a modular multimodal human activity prediction framework that allows us to benchmark various MLLMs, input variations, In-Context Learning (ICL), and autoregressive techniques. Our evaluation indicates that the best-performing framework configuration is able to reach 92.8% semantic similarity and 66.1% exact label accuracy in predicting human behaviors in the target frame.

- **[DiLQR: Differentiable Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator via Implicit Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17473)**  `arXiv:2506.17473`  `cs.RO`  
  _Shuyuan Wang, Philip D. Loewen, Michael Forbes, Bhushan Gopaluni, Wei Pan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While differentiable control has emerged as a powerful paradigm combining model-free flexibility with model-based efficiency, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) remains underexplored as a differentiable component. The scalability of differentiating through extended iterations and horizons poses significant challenges, hindering iLQR from being an effective differentiable controller. This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that facilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable and differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect of this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient of an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a constant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate gradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control benchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational performance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared to automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning performance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and better model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical gradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with visual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional, fully end-to-end tasks.

- **[Towards Zero-Shot Coordination between Teams of Agents: The N-XPlay Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17560)**  `arXiv:2506.17560`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`  
  _Ava Abderezaei, Chi-Hui Lin, Joseph Miceli, Naren Sivagnanadasan, St√©phane Aroca-Ouellette, Jake Brawer, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates. Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark, enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-, three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an ``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and ``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

- **[Transformer World Model for Sample Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18537)**  `arXiv:2506.18537`  `cs.LG` `cs.MA`  
  _Azad Deihim, Eduardo Alonso, Dimitra Apostolopoulou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences, allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

- **[Learning to Adapt Frozen CLIP for Few-Shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17307)**  `arXiv:2506.17307`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Zhixiang Chi, Li Gu, Huan Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Yanan Wu, Yang Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW.

  Machine learning has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then continually learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This article presents a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novelty discovery, and continual learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances are summarized. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for further progress in the field. By providing a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, this article aims to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

  _Viacheslav Surkov, Chris Wendler, Antonio Mari, Mikhail Terekhov, Justin Deschenaux, Robert West, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.

- **[Directional Gradient Projection for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15895)**  `arXiv:2502.15895`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.

- **[RLPR: Extrapolating RLVR to General Domains without Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18254)**  `arXiv:2506.18254`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Tianyu Yu, Bo Ji, Shouli Wang, Shu Yao, Zefan Wang, Ganqu Cui, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama, and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6 points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points across seven benchmarks.

- **[Learning to Reason under Off-Policy Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14945)**  `arXiv:2504.14945`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jianhao Yan, Yafu Li, Zican Hu, Zhi Wang, Ganqu Cui, Xiaoye Qu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards~(\textit{RLVR}). However, existing \textit{RLVR} approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{LUFFY} (\textbf{L}earning to reason \textbf{U}nder o\textbf{FF}-polic\textbf{Y} guidance), a framework that augments \textit{RLVR} with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Specifically, LUFFY combines the Mixed-Policy GRPO framework, which has a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate, alongside policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Compared with previous RLVR methods, LUFFY achieves an over \textbf{+6.4} average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over \textbf{+6.2} points in out-of-distribution tasks. Most significantly, we show that LUFFY successfully trains weak models in scenarios where on-policy RLVR completely fails. These results provide compelling evidence that LUFFY transcends the fundamental limitations of on-policy RLVR and demonstrates the great potential of utilizing off-policy guidance in RLVR.

  _Rahul Atul Bhope, K.R. Jayaram, Praveen Venkateswaran, Nalini Venkatasubramanian_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

  Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research, leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG (ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs. By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable down-stream applications in causal discovery.

  We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to partial solutions.

  Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

  Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$ is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size. Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning in energy-constrained settings.

  Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode (granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment. We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2% of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000 steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations, indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring reliable reasoning and interpretability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels (i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength. In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition, theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e., "obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty, causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off between task performance and inference efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs. This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer (MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE) layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.

  Model customization necessitates high-quality and diverse datasets, but acquiring such data remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. Despite the great potential of large language models (LLMs) for data synthesis, current approaches are constrained by limited seed data, model biases, and low-variation prompts, resulting in limited diversity and biased distributions with the increase of data scales. To tackle this challenge, we introduce TREESYNTH, a tree-guided subspace-based data synthesis approach inspired by decision trees. It constructs a spatial partitioning tree to recursively divide a task-specific full data space (i.e., root node) into numerous atomic subspaces (i.e., leaf nodes) with mutually exclusive and exhaustive attributes to ensure both distinctiveness and comprehensiveness before synthesizing samples within each atomic subspace. This globally dividing-and-synthesizing method finally collects subspace samples into a comprehensive dataset, effectively circumventing repetition and space collapse to ensure the diversity of large-scale data synthesis. Furthermore, the spatial partitioning tree enables sample allocation into atomic subspaces, allowing the rebalancing of existing datasets for more balanced and comprehensive distributions. Empirically, extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superior data diversity, model performance, and robust scalability of TREESYNTH compared to both human-crafted datasets and peer data synthesis methods, with an average performance gain reaching 10%. Besides, the consistent improvements of TREESYNTH-balanced datasets highlight its efficacious application to redistribute existing datasets for more comprehensive coverage and the induced performance enhancement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) training is inherently unstable due to factors such as moving targets and high gradient variance. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) can introduce additional difficulty. Differing preferences can complicate the alignment process, and prediction errors in a trained reward model can become more severe as the LLM generates unseen outputs. To enhance training robustness, RL has adopted techniques from supervised learning, such as ensembles and layer normalization. In this work, we improve the stability of RL training by adapting the reverse cross entropy (RCE) from supervised learning for noisy data to define a symmetric RL loss. We demonstrate performance improvements across various tasks and scales. We conduct experiments in discrete action tasks (Atari games) and continuous action space tasks (MuJoCo benchmark and Box2D) using Symmetric A2C (SA2C) and Symmetric PPO (SPPO), with and without added noise with especially notable performance in SPPO across different hyperparameters. Furthermore, we validate the benefits of the symmetric RL loss when using SPPO for large language models through improved performance in RLHF tasks, such as IMDB positive sentiment sentiment and TL;DR summarization tasks.

  Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a promising approach for managing task complexity across multiple levels of abstraction and accelerating long-horizon agent exploration. However, the effectiveness of hierarchical policies heavily depends on prior knowledge and manual assumptions about skill definitions and task decomposition. In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-based framework, namely SIDM, for hierarchical Decision Making in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. Central to our work is the utilization of structural information embedded in the decision-making process to adaptively and dynamically discover and learn hierarchical policies through environmental abstractions. Specifically, we present an abstraction mechanism that processes historical state-action trajectories to construct abstract representations of states and actions. We define and optimize directed structural entropy, a metric quantifying the uncertainty in transition dynamics between abstract states, to discover skills that capture key transition patterns in RL environments. Building on these findings, we develop a skill-based learning method for single-agent scenarios and a role-based collaboration method for multi-agent scenarios, both of which can flexibly integrate various underlying algorithms for enhanced performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and stability of policy learning by up to 32.70%, 64.86%, and 88.26%, respectively, as measured by average rewards, convergence timesteps, and standard deviations.

  Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

  LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.

  Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs. ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points, which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT (Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer), a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior. Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$ for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

  Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

  Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However, their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover, Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods.

  Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets, these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model. It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks enables synergistic learning.

  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution: the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction) extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast, Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations, maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the model's expressive capacity.To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion, preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework. Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT), further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target LLM's capabilities.

  Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.

  _Xuyang Chen, Keyu Yan, Lin Zhao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function. Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear margins on the more challenging tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dyna-style off-policy model-based reinforcement learning (DMBRL) algorithms are a family of techniques for generating synthetic state transition data and thereby enhancing the sample efficiency of off-policy RL algorithms. This paper identifies and investigates a surprising performance gap observed when applying DMBRL algorithms across different benchmark environments with proprioceptive observations. We show that, while DMBRL algorithms perform well in OpenAI Gym, their performance can drop significantly in DeepMind Control Suite (DMC), even though these settings offer similar tasks and identical physics backends. Modern techniques designed to address several key issues that arise in these settings do not provide a consistent improvement across all environments, and overall our results show that adding synthetic rollouts to the training process -- the backbone of Dyna-style algorithms -- significantly degrades performance across most DMC environments. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of several fundamental challenges in model-based RL and show that, like many optimization fields, there is no free lunch when evaluating performance across diverse benchmarks in RL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active Learning (AL) addresses the crucial challenge of enabling machines to efficiently gather labeled examples through strategic queries. Among the many AL strategies, Uncertainty Sampling (US) stands out as one of the most widely adopted. US queries the example(s) that the current model finds uncertain, proving to be both straightforward and effective. Despite claims in the literature suggesting superior alternatives to US, community-wide acceptance remains elusive. In fact, existing benchmarks for tabular datasets present conflicting conclusions on the continued competitiveness of US. In this study, we review the literature on AL strategies in the last decade and build the most comprehensive open-source AL benchmark to date to understand the relative merits of different AL strategies. The benchmark surpasses existing ones by encompassing a broader coverage of strategies, models, and data. Through our investigation of the conflicting conclusions in existing tabular AL benchmarks by evaluation under broad AL experimental settings, we uncover fresh insights into the often-overlooked issue of using machine learning models--**model compatibility** in the context of US. Specifically, we notice that adopting the different models for the querying unlabeled examples and learning tasks would degrade US's effectiveness. Notably, our findings affirm that US maintains a competitive edge over other strategies when paired with compatible models. These findings have practical implications and provide a concrete recipe for AL practitioners, empowering them to make informed decisions when working with tabular classifications with limited labeled data.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and (2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1 designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1 first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future research and applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of 124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets, each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364 multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to 78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to the overall image context.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language. Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports. However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2 images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale, problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports, we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo:this https URL.

  _Yuxuan Yang, Tao Geng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

  Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they are still prone to hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{this https URL}{here}.

  Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD, offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods to handle multi-modal distribution shifts. The code is available atthis https URL.

  In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency.

  This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee, designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data. Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex reasoning.

  Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs) over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS, especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available atthis https URL.

  We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive image-to-world generation, we will open-source the Matrix-Game model weights and the GameWorld Score benchmark atthis https URL.

  Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations, enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.

  Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules.

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings, which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust, efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical prognosis prediction workflows.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network, enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

  Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However, conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions. OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in endoscopy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities. Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e., imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO over state-of-the-art competitors.

  Spatial perception and reasoning are core components of human cognition, encompassing object recognition, spatial relational understanding, and dynamic reasoning. Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.

  Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

  AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However, existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional, audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles, FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

  This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii) By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

  Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding. Experimental results on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, particularly in handling occlusions and novel viewpoints.

  Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene.

  Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap, we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise comparisons.Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from 8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100 evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established evaluation resource.Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered evaluation in Generative 3D.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based systems.

  Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive. Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions.

  Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However, designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2 imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering, resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings, surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing time series.

  An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users: supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

  Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes, textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique. Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing, demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.

  3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However, in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning. Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

  Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE, featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE) module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad applicability of our method across various materials, including those transparent in the visible spectrum.

In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer, with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of 10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning approach.

  Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating 40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while demonstrating greater robustness.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies, their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery. Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and models of our YOLOv13 model are available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external tools.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism. Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image (WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling, enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits. JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a 60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

  The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

  _Younghun Kim, Minsuk Jang, Myung-Joon Kwon, Wonjun Lee, Changick Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence. To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI} (\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions. However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain. First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in challenging scenarios.

  Traditional particle size distribution (PSD) analyses create significant downtime and are expensive in labor and maintenance. These drawbacks could be alleviated using optical grain size analysis integrated into routine geotechnical laboratory workflow. This paper presents a high-resolution dataset of 12,714 images of 321 different soil samples collected in the Montreal, Quebec region, alongside their PSD analysis. It is designed to provide a robust starting point for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in geotechnical applications. Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view position with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per pixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9 inch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was used. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was employed for mass reduction.

  Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving, prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.

  Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant challenge due to complex distortions such as turbidity, low illumination, and occlusion, which severely degrade the performance of standard vision systems. This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain.

  Image restoration faces challenges including ineffective feature fusion, computational bottlenecks and inefficient diffusion processes. To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics.

  In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.

Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks.

  The development of Generalist Virtual Agents (GVAs) has shown significant promise in autonomous task execution. However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-Wise Multi-Dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional machine learning models for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) rely on supervised training, requiring extensive manual annotations, and often produce errors due to the separation between layout and text processing. In contrast, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a general approach to recognizing diverse handwriting styles without the need for model-specific training. The study benchmarks various proprietary and open-source LLMs against Transkribus models, evaluating their performance on both modern and historical datasets written in English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, emphasis is placed on testing the models' ability to autonomously correct previously generated outputs. Findings indicate that proprietary models, especially Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperform open-source alternatives in zero-shot settings. MLLMs achieve excellent results in recognizing modern handwriting and exhibit a preference for the English language due to their pre-training dataset composition. Comparisons with Transkribus show no consistent advantage for either approach. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate limited ability to autonomously correct errors in zero-shot transcriptions.

Noise2Score3D learns the score function of the underlying point cloud distribution directly from noisy data, eliminating the need for clean data during training. Using Tweedie's formula, our method performs denoising in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thus improving both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Clouds as a denoising quality metric, which allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks among unsupervised learning methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics. Noise2Score3D also demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Our method, by addressing the generalization issue and challenge of the absence of clean data in learning-based methods, paves the way for learning-based point cloud denoising methods in real-world applications.

  This work introduces ILIAS, a new test dataset for Instance-Level Image retrieval At Scale. It is designed to evaluate the ability of current and future foundation models and retrieval techniques to recognize particular objects. The key benefits over existing datasets include large scale, domain diversity, accurate ground truth, and a performance that is far from saturated. ILIAS includes query and positive images for 1,000 object instances, manually collected to capture challenging conditions and diverse domains. Large-scale retrieval is conducted against 100 million distractor images from YFCC100M. To avoid false negatives without extra annotation effort, we include only query objects confirmed to have emerged after 2014, i.e. the compilation date of YFCC100M. An extensive benchmarking is performed with the following observations: i) models fine-tuned on specific domains, such as landmarks or products, excel in that domain but fail on ILIAS ii) learning a linear adaptation layer using multi-domain class supervision results in performance improvements, especially for vision-language models iii) local descriptors in retrieval re-ranking are still a key ingredient, especially in the presence of severe background clutter iv) the text-to-image performance of the vision-language foundation models is surprisingly close to the corresponding image-to-image case. website:this https URL

  Object detection has greatly improved over the past decade thanks to advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets. However, detecting objects reflected in surfaces remains an underexplored area. Reflective surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, appearing in homes, offices, public spaces, and natural environments. Accurate detection and interpretation of reflected objects are essential for various applications. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a extensive benchmark specifically designed for Reflected Object Detection. Our Reflected Object Detection Dataset (RODD) features a diverse collection of images showcasing reflected objects in various contexts, providing standard annotations for both real and reflected objects. This distinguishes it from traditional object detection benchmarks. RODD encompasses 10 categories and includes 21,059 images of real and reflected objects across different backgrounds, complete with standard bounding box annotations and the classification of objects as real or reflected. Additionally, we present baseline results by adapting five state-of-the-art object detection models to address this challenging task. Experimental results underscore the limitations of existing methods when applied to reflected object detection, highlighting the need for specialized approaches. By releasing RODD, we aim to support and advance future research on detecting reflected objects. Dataset and code are available at:this https URL.

  The area of temporally fine-grained video representation learning focuses on generating frame-by-frame representations for temporally dense tasks, such as fine-grained action phase classification and frame retrieval. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art for self-supervised models in this area by re-examining the design of transformer architectures for video representation learning. A key aspect of our approach is the improved sharing of scene information in the temporal pipeline by representing multiple salient entities per frame. Prior works use late-fusion architectures that reduce frames to a single-dimensional vector before modeling any cross-frame dynamics. In contrast, our Multi-entity Video Transformer (MV-Former) processes the frames as groups of entities represented as tokens linked across time. To achieve this, we propose a Learnable Spatial Token Pooling strategy to identify and extract features for multiple salient regions per frame. Through our experiments, we show that MV-Former outperforms previous self-supervised methods, and also surpasses some prior works that use additional supervision or training data. When combined with additional pre-training data from Kinetics-400, MV-Former achieves a further performance boost. Overall, our MV-Former achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple fine-grained video benchmarks and shows that parsing video scenes as collections of entities can enhance performance in video tasks.

  Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%, highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance detection.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\% improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes usingthis http URLcode and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.

  Multi-agent debate (MAD) has gained significant attention as a promising line of research to improve the factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite its conceptual appeal, current MAD research suffers from critical limitations in evaluation practices, including limited benchmark coverage, weak baseline comparisons, and inconsistent setups. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 5 representative MAD methods across 9 benchmarks using 4 foundational models. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that MAD often fail to outperform simple single-agent baselines such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, even when consuming significantly more inference-time computation. To advance MAD research, we further explore the role of model heterogeneity and find it as a universal antidote to consistently improve current MAD frameworks. Based on our findings, we argue that the field must stop overvaluing MAD in its current form; for true advancement, we must critically rethink evaluation paradigms and actively embrace model heterogeneity as a core design principle.

  The success of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in mitigating hallucinations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) critically hinges on the true reward gaps within preference pairs. However, current methods, typically relying on ranking or rewriting strategies, often struggle to optimize these reward gaps in a systematic way during data curation. A core difficulty lies in precisely characterizing and strategically manipulating the overall reward gap configuration, that is, the deliberate design of how to shape these reward gaps within each preference pair across the data. To address this, we introduce Topic-level Preference Rewriting(TPR), a novel framework designed for the systematic optimization of reward gap configuration. Through selectively replacing semantic topics within VLM responses with model's own resampled candidates for targeted rewriting, TPR can provide topic-level control over fine-grained semantic details. This precise control enables advanced data curation strategies, such as progressively adjusting the difficulty of rejected responses, thereby sculpting an effective reward gap configuration that guides the model to overcome challenging hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate TPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by an average of 20%. Notably, it significantly reduces hallucinations by up to 93% on ObjectHal-Bench, and also exhibits superior data efficiency towards robust and cost-effective VLM alignment.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on ''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B, consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA). It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance, Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is available atthis https URL.

These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small.

Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 tokens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality. We discuss additional results on a variety of code benchmarks spanning multiple languages and use-cases as well as real-world validation by developers on Copilot Arena, where the model currently ranks second on quality and is the fastest model overall.

  Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.

  Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5% with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context length on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence (RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al., 2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5 models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study summarization.

  Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks. We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to 89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards atthis https URLwhich are updated with new models and allow interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to influence education and help to address the global learning crisis. Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and policy decisions.

  The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''. Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt, which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that \texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover, ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through reinforcement learning.

  The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables, databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap, presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and the framework on [GitHub].

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications. Project Page -this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings, characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories. Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods struggle.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming, side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100 manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B) evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

  Humans ponder before articulating complex sentence elements, enabling deeper cognitive processing through focused effort. In this work, we introduce this pondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward process within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of generating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model ponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the predicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input for another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this way through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Experiments across three widely used open-source architectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For language modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance comparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters. On 9 downstream benchmarks, our pondering-enhanced Pythia models significantly outperform the official Pythia models. Notably, PonderingPythia-2.8B surpasses Pythia-6.9B, and PonderingPythia-1B is comparable to TinyLlama-1.1B, which is trained on 10 times more data. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have improved factuality by grounding outputs in external evidence. However, they remain susceptible to unfaithful generation, where outputs contradict retrieved context despite its relevance and accuracy. Existing approaches aiming to improve faithfulness primarily focus on enhancing the utilization of external context, but often overlook the persistent influence of internal parametric knowledge during generation. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind unfaithful generation and identify a subset of mid-to-deep feed-forward networks (FFNs) that are disproportionately activated in such cases. Building on this insight, we propose Parametric Knowledge Muting through FFN Suppression (ParamMute), a framework that improves contextual faithfulness by suppressing the activation of unfaithfulness-associated FFNs and calibrating the model toward retrieved knowledge. To evaluate our approach, we introduce CoFaithfulQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate faithfulness in scenarios where internal knowledge conflicts with accurate external evidence. Experimental results show that ParamMute significantly enhances faithfulness across both CoFaithfulQA and the established ConFiQA benchmark, achieving substantial reductions in reliance on parametric memory. These findings underscore the importance of mitigating internal knowledge dominance and provide a new direction for improving LLM trustworthiness in RAG. All codes are available atthis https URL.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment. Projects:this https URL

  _Mostafa Saeed, Nizar Habash_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for Arabic lemmatization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks - multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1) Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2) Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95% accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40% top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper usage.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters, showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

  Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text, including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources. However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources, AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup, demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone, achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges, including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists, highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score. Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical question-answering.

  Large Language Diffusion Models, or diffusion LLMs, have emerged as a significant focus in NLP research, with substantial effort directed toward understanding their scalability and downstream task performance. However, their long-context capabilities remain unexplored, lacking systematic analysis or methods for context extension. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation comparing the long-context performance of diffusion LLMs and traditional auto-regressive LLMs. We first identify a unique characteristic of diffusion LLMs, unlike auto-regressive LLMs, they maintain remarkably stable perplexity during direct context extrapolation. Moreover, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct local perception phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments. We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short. Consequently, this study establishes the first length extrapolation method for diffusion LLMs while providing essential theoretical insights and empirical benchmarks critical for advancing future research on long-context diffusion LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification, semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

  Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to answer questions that span tens of thousands of tokens, especially when multi-hop reasoning is involved. While prior benchmarks explore long-context comprehension or multi-hop reasoning in isolation, none jointly vary context length and reasoning depth in natural narrative settings. We introduce NovelHopQA, the first benchmark to evaluate 1-4 hop QA over 64k-128k-token excerpts from 83 full-length public-domain novels. A keyword-guided pipeline builds hop-separated chains grounded in coherent storylines. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art models and apply oracle-context filtering to ensure all questions are genuinely answerable. Human annotators validate both alignment and hop depth. We additionally present retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) evaluations to test model performance when only selected passages are provided instead of the full context. We noticed consistent accuracy drops with increased hops and context length increase, even for frontier models-revealing that sheer scale does not guarantee robust reasoning. Failure-mode analysis highlights common breakdowns such as missed final-hop integration and long-range drift. NovelHopQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting to test multi-hop reasoning at scale.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

  Mainstream large vision-language models (LVLMs) inherently encode cultural biases, highlighting the need for diverse multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce Pearl, a large-scale Arabic multimodal dataset and benchmark explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods. Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed multimodal modeling research. All datasets and benchmarks are publicly available.

  _Spencer Hong, Meng Luo, Xinyi Wan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

  Proper nouns in Arabic Wikipedia are frequently undiacritized, creating ambiguity in pronunciation and interpretation, especially for transliterated named entities of foreign origin. While transliteration and diacritization have been well-studied separately in Arabic NLP, their intersection remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new manually diacritized dataset of Arabic proper nouns of various origins with their English Wikipedia equivalent glosses, and present the challenges and guidelines we followed to create it. We benchmark GPT-4o on the task of recovering full diacritization given the undiacritized Arabic and English forms, and analyze its performance. Achieving 73% accuracy, our results underscore both the difficulty of the task and the need for improved models and resources. We release our dataset to facilitate further research on Arabic Wikipedia proper noun diacritization.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both RAG and long-context LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups for long-context inference. Our analyses also reveal the robustness of RAPID across various context lengths and retrieval quality.

  Building safe Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages is essential in ensuring both safe access and linguistic diversity. To this end, we conduct a large-scale, comprehensive safety evaluation of the current LLM landscape. For this purpose, we introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, with category-wise annotations. Our extensive experiments on 39 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar inconsistencies can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages.

  The paradigm of retrieval-augmented generated (RAG) helps mitigate hallucinations of large language models (LLMs). However, RAG also introduces biases contained within the retrieved documents. These biases can be amplified in scenarios which are multilingual and culturally-sensitive, such as territorial disputes. We thus introduce BordIRLines, a dataset of territorial disputes paired with retrieved Wikipedia documents, across 49 languages. We evaluate the cross-lingual robustness of this RAG setting by formalizing several modes for multilingual retrieval. Our experiments on several LLMs show that incorporating perspectives from diverse languages can in fact improve robustness; retrieving multilingual documents best improves response consistency and decreases geopolitical bias over RAG with purely in-language documents. We also consider how RAG responses utilize presented documents, finding a much wider variance in the linguistic distribution of response citations, when querying in low-resource languages. Our further analyses investigate the various aspects of a cross-lingual RAG pipeline, from retrieval to document contents. We release our benchmark and code to support continued research towards equitable information access across languages atthis https URL.

  Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs), current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency, or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an increase in accuracy on MedQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs. F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX (Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 45.2%).

  Perturbation robustness evaluates the vulnerabilities of models, arising from a variety of perturbations, such as data corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding the mechanisms of perturbation robustness is critical for global interpretability. We present a model-agnostic, global mechanistic interpretability method to interpret the perturbation robustness of image models. This research is motivated by two key aspects. First, previous global interpretability works, in tandem with robustness benchmarks, e.g. mean corruption error (mCE), are not designed to directly interpret the mechanisms of perturbation robustness within image models. Second, we notice that the spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of perturbed natural images exponentially decay over the frequency. This power-law-like decay implies that: Low-frequency signals are generally more robust than high-frequency signals -- yet high classification accuracy can not be achieved by low-frequency signals alone. By applying Shapley value theory, our method axiomatically quantifies the predictive powers of robust features and non-robust features within an information theory framework. Our method, dubbed as \textbf{I-ASIDE} (\textbf{I}mage \textbf{A}xiomatic \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{I}mportance \textbf{D}ecomposition \textbf{E}xplanation), provides a unique insight into model robustness mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments over a variety of vision models pre-trained on ImageNet to show that \textbf{I-ASIDE} can not only \textbf{measure} the perturbation robustness but also \textbf{provide interpretations} of its mechanisms.

  Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual) pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks. Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent. Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the original token count.

  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task, SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and (iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally, logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

  Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

  Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

  Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

  Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field. However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods. As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones, non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in Agentic AI.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant capability in vision-language understanding. However, one critical issue that persists in these models is sycophancy, where models are unduly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, resulting in biased outputs and hallucinations. Despite the rapid development of LVLMs, evaluating and mitigating sycophancy remains largely under-explored. In this work, we fill this gap by systematically analyzing sycophancy across multiple vision-language benchmarks and propose an inference-time mitigation framework. We curate leading queries and quantify the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LVLMs to prompt-induced bias, revealing consistent performance degradation and instability across models and tasks. Our analysis further uncovers model-specific behavioral traits, such as sentiment sensitivity and prediction polarity shifts under sycophancy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a training-free, model-agnostic framework that operates entirely at inference time. Our approach first employs a query neutralizer, leveraging an language model to suppress implicit sycophantic bias in user queries. We then introduce a sycophancy-aware contrastive decoding mechanism that dynamically recalibrates token-level output distributions by contrasting responses to neutralized and leading queries. Finally, an adaptive logits refinement module further modifies the contrasted logits by integrating both a adaptive plausibility filter and query sentiment scaler, ensuring coherent and robust generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework effectively mitigates sycophancy across all evaluated models, while maintaining performance on neutral prompts. Our results suggest that sycophancy in LVLMs is a general and urgent challenge, and that inference-time strategies offer a promising path toward trustworthy multimodal reasoning.

  This paper shows the benefits and fruitfulness of evaluating LLMs with multiple problems at once, a paradigm we call multi-problem evaluation (MPE). Unlike conventional single-problem evaluation, where a prompt presents a single problem and expects one specific answer, MPE places multiple problems together in a single prompt and assesses how well an LLM answers all these problems in a single output. Leveraging 6 classification and 12 reasoning benchmarks that already exist, we introduce a new benchmark called ZeMPE (Zero-shot Multi-Problem Evaluation), comprising 53,100 zero-shot multi-problem prompts. We experiment with a total of 13 LLMs from 5 model families on ZeMPE to present a comprehensive and systematic MPE. Our results show that LLMs are capable of handling multiple problems from a single data source as well as handling them separately, but there are conditions this multiple problem handling capability falls short. In addition, we perform in-depth further analyses and explore model-level factors that may enable multiple problem handling capabilities in LLMs. We release our corpus and code to facilitate future research.

  Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.

  Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.

  The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents. These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks, including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies, and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is available at: {this https URL}.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

  The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible, struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while maintaining scalability for real-world applications.

  Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2) Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while substantially reducing communication overhead.

  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency. Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically, inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface. With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

  Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models, requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8 major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation, automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning. For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and multimodal understanding.

  Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities, from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs' performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback from the CTF environment.Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80% performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU, CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

  Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training.

  Automating table extraction (TE) from business documents is critical for industrial workflows but remains challenging due to sparse annotations and error-prone multi-stage pipelines. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage unlabeled data, existing methods rely on confidence scores that poorly reflect extraction quality. We propose QUEST, a Quality-aware Semi-supervised Table extraction framework designed for business documents. QUEST introduces a novel quality assessment model that evaluates structural and contextual features of extracted tables, trained to predict F1 scores instead of relying on confidence metrics. This quality-aware approach guides pseudo-label selection during iterative SSL training, while diversity measures (DPP, Vendi score, IntDiv) mitigate confirmation bias. Experiments on a proprietary business dataset (1000 annotated + 10000 unannotated documents) show QUEST improves F1 from 64% to 74% and reduces empty predictions by 45% (from 12% to 6.5%). On the DocILE benchmark (600 annotated + 20000 unannotated documents), QUEST achieves a 50% F1 score (up from 42%) and reduces empty predictions by 19% (from 27% to 22%). The framework's interpretable quality assessments and robustness to annotation scarcity make it particularly suited for business documents, where structural consistency and data completeness are paramount.

  Large reasoning models have recently made significant strides in mathematical and code reasoning, yet their success has not transferred smoothly to the medical domain. While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications. Checkpoints, code, and data can be found inthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models. All code, models, and datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[UIShift: Enhancing VLM-based GUI Agents through Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12493)**  `arXiv:2505.12493`  `cs.AI`  
  _Longxi Gao, Li Zhang, Mengwei Xu_

  Training effective Vision Language Models (VLMs) for GUI agents typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over large-scale annotated datasets, where the collection process is labor-intensive and error-prone. In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets, two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future. Code, model, and data are available at:this https URL
