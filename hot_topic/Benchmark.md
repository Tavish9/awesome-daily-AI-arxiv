- **[TiC-LM: A Web-Scale Benchmark for Time-Continual LLM Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02107)**  `arXiv:2504.02107`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on historical web data inevitably become outdated. We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.

- **[When Reasoning Meets Compression: Benchmarking Compressed Large Reasoning Models on Complex Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02010)**  `arXiv:2504.02010`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent open-source large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, but their large parameter count makes them prohibitively expensive for individuals. The compression of large language models (LLMs) offers an effective solution to reduce cost of computational resources. However, systematic studies on the performance of compressed LLMs in complex reasoning tasks, especially for LRMs, are lacking. Most works on quantization and pruning focus on preserving language modeling performance, while existing distillation works do not comprehensively benchmark student models based on reasoning difficulty or compression impact on knowledge and reasoning. In this paper, we benchmark compressed DeepSeek-R1 models on four different reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences of BIG-Bench Hard, and MuSiQue), ranging from mathematical to multihop reasoning, using quantization, distillation, and pruning methods. We benchmark 2.51-, 1.73-, and 1.58-bit R1 models that adopt dynamic quantization. We also benchmark distilled R1 models that are based on LLaMA or Qwen and run SparseGPT on them to obtain various sparsity levels. Studying the performance and behavior of compressed LRMs, we report their performance scores and test-time compute (number of tokens spent on each question). Notably, using MuSiQue, we find that parameter count has a much greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than on their reasoning capability, which can inform the choice of compression techniques. Through our empirical analysis of test-time compute, we find that shorter model outputs generally achieve better performance than longer ones across several benchmarks for both R1 and its compressed variants, highlighting the need for more concise reasoning chains.

  Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term "Type I hallucinations". Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats -- typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute -- which we term "Type II hallucinations". Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline. Code is now available atthis https URL.

- **[VinaBench: Benchmark for Faithful and Consistent Visual Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20871)**  `arXiv:2503.20871`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Silin Gao, Sheryl Mathew, Li Mi, Sepideh Mamooler, Mengjie Zhao, Hiromi Wakaki, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual narrative generation transforms textual narratives into sequences of images illustrating the content of the text. However, generating visual narratives that are faithful to the input text and self-consistent across generated images remains an open challenge, due to the lack of knowledge constraints used for planning the stories. In this work, we propose a new benchmark, VinaBench, to address this challenge. Our benchmark annotates the underlying commonsense and discourse constraints in visual narrative samples, offering systematic scaffolds for learning the implicit strategies of visual storytelling. Based on the incorporated narrative constraints, we further propose novel metrics to closely evaluate the consistency of generated narrative images and the alignment of generations with the input textual narrative. Our results across three generative vision models demonstrate that learning with VinaBench's knowledge constraints effectively improves the faithfulness and cohesion of generated visual narratives.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rip currents are the leading cause of fatal accidents and injuries on many beaches worldwide, emphasizing the importance of automatically detecting these hazardous surface water currents. In this paper, we address a novel task: rip current instance segmentation. We introduce a comprehensive dataset containing $2,466$ images with newly created polygonal annotations for instance segmentation, used for training and validation. Additionally, we present a novel dataset comprising $17$ drone videos (comprising about $24K$ frames) captured at $30 FPS$, annotated with both polygons for instance segmentation and bounding boxes for object detection, employed for testing purposes. We train various versions of YOLOv8 for instance segmentation on static images and assess their performance on the test dataset (videos). The best results were achieved by the YOLOv8-nano model (runnable on a portable device), with an mAP50 of $88.94%$ on the validation dataset and $81.21%$ macro average on the test dataset. The results provide a baseline for future research in rip current segmentation. Our work contributes to the existing literature by introducing a detailed, annotated dataset, and training a deep learning model for instance segmentation of rip currents. The code, training details and the annotated dataset are made publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[RipVIS: Rip Currents Video Instance Segmentation Benchmark for Beach Monitoring and Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01128)**  `arXiv:2504.01128`  `cs.CV` `cs.AI`

  Rip currents are strong, localized and narrow currents of water that flow outwards into the sea, causing numerous beach-related injuries and fatalities worldwide. Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to their amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires expert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale video instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current segmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets, featuring $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$ frames) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including drones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse visual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water color variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic scenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without rip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip current segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a particular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false negatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel post-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA). RipVIS aims to set a new standard for rip current segmentation, contributing towards safer beach environments. We offer a benchmark website to share data, models, and results with the research community, encouraging ongoing collaboration and future contributions, atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To address this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort, RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released atthis https URL.

- **[GPT-ImgEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Diagnosing GPT4o in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02782)**  `arXiv:2504.02782`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhiyuan Yan, Junyan Ye, Weijia Li, Zilong Huang, Shenghai Yuan, Xiangyang He, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent breakthroughs in OpenAI's GPT4o model have demonstrated surprisingly good capabilities in image generation and editing, resulting in significant excitement in the community. This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond. The codes and datasets used for evaluating GPT-4o can be found atthis https URL.

- **[SkyReels-A2: Compose Anything in Video Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02436)**  `arXiv:2504.02436`  `cs.CV`  
  _Zhengcong Fei, Debang Li, Di Qiu, Jiahua Wang, Yikun Dou, Rui Wang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents SkyReels-A2, a controllable video generation framework capable of assembling arbitrary visual elements (e.g., characters, objects, backgrounds) into synthesized videos based on textual prompts while maintaining strict consistency with reference images for each element. We term this task elements-to-video (E2V), whose primary challenges lie in preserving the fidelity of each reference element, ensuring coherent composition of the scene, and achieving natural outputs. To address these, we first design a comprehensive data pipeline to construct prompt-reference-video triplets for model training. Next, we propose a novel image-text joint embedding model to inject multi-element representations into the generative process, balancing element-specific consistency with global coherence and text alignment. We also optimize the inference pipeline for both speed and output stability. Moreover, we introduce a carefully curated benchmark for systematic evaluation, i.e, A2 Bench. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate diverse, high-quality videos with precise element control. SkyReels-A2 is the first open-source commercial grade model for the generation of E2V, performing favorably against advanced closed-source commercial models. We anticipate SkyReels-A2 will advance creative applications such as drama and virtual e-commerce, pushing the boundaries of controllable video generation.

- **[Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images Salient Object Detection: The First Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02416)**  `arXiv:2504.02416`  `cs.CV`  
  _Peifu Liu, Huiyan Bai, Tingfa Xu, Jihui Wang, Huan Chen, Jianan Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The objective of hyperspectral remote sensing image salient object detection (HRSI-SOD) is to identify objects or regions that exhibit distinct spectrum contrasts with the background. This area holds significant promise for practical applications; however, progress has been limited by a notable scarcity of dedicated datasets and methodologies. To bridge this gap and stimulate further research, we introduce the first HRSI-SOD dataset, termed HRSSD, which includes 704 hyperspectral images and 5327 pixel-level annotated salient objects. The HRSSD dataset poses substantial challenges for salient object detection algorithms due to large scale variation, diverse foreground-background relations, and multi-salient objects. Additionally, we propose an innovative and efficient baseline model for HRSI-SOD, termed the Deep Spectral Saliency Network (DSSN). The core of DSSN is the Cross-level Saliency Assessment Block, which performs pixel-wise attention and evaluates the contributions of multi-scale similarity maps at each spatial location, effectively reducing erroneous responses in cluttered regions and emphasizes salient regions across scales. Additionally, the High-resolution Fusion Module combines bottom-up fusion strategy and learned spatial upsampling to leverage the strengths of multi-scale saliency maps, ensuring accurate localization of small objects. Experiments on the HRSSD dataset robustly validate the superiority of DSSN, underscoring the critical need for specialized datasets and methodologies in this domain. Further evaluations on the HSOD-BIT and HS-SOD datasets demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. The dataset and source code are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[Re-thinking Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02259)**  `arXiv:2504.02259`  `cs.CV`  
  _Jinhui Ye, Zihan Wang, Haosen Sun, Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran, Zane Durante, Cristobal Eyzaguirre, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient understanding of long-form videos remains a significant challenge in computer vision. In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding, studying a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). In particular, our contributions are two-fold: First, we formulate temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem, i.e., finding a minimal set of relevant frames (typically one to five) among tens of thousands of frames from real-world long videos given specific queries. To validate our formulation, we create LV-Haystack, the first benchmark containing 3,874 human-annotated instances with fine-grained evaluation metrics for assessing keyframe search quality and computational efficiency. Experimental results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with SOTA keyframe selection methods achieving only 2.1% temporal F1 score on the LVBench subset.Next, inspired by visual search in images, we re-think temporal searching and propose a lightweight keyframe searching framework, T*, which casts the expensive temporal search as a spatial search problem. T* leverages superior visual localization capabilities typically used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our extensive experiments show that when integrated with existing methods, T* significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding performance. Specifically, under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on LongVideoBench XL subset. Our PyTorch code, benchmark dataset and models are included in the Supplementary material.

- **[From Flatland to Space: Teaching Vision-Language Models to Perceive and Reason in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22976)**  `arXiv:2503.22976`  `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in LVLMs have improved vision-language understanding, but they still struggle with spatial perception, limiting their ability to reason about complex 3D scenes. Unlike previous approaches that incorporate 3D representations into models to improve spatial understanding, we aim to unlock the potential of VLMs by leveraging spatially relevant image data. To this end, we introduce a novel 2D spatial data generation and annotation pipeline built upon scene data with 3D ground-truth. This pipeline enables the creation of a diverse set of spatial tasks, ranging from basic perception tasks to more complex reasoning tasks. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct SPAR-7M, a large-scale dataset generated from thousands of scenes across multiple public datasets. In addition, we introduce SPAR-Bench, a benchmark designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of spatial capabilities compared to existing spatial benchmarks, supporting both single-view and multi-view inputs. Training on both SPAR-7M and large-scale 2D datasets enables our models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D spatial benchmarks. Further fine-tuning on 3D task-specific datasets yields competitive results, underscoring the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing spatial reasoning.

- **[Token-Driven GammaTune: Adaptive Calibration for Enhanced Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00030)**  `arXiv:2504.00030`  `cs.CL` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Aayush Gautam, Susav Shrestha, Narasimha Reddy_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.

Our minimal pairs are created using a fully automated pipeline, leveraging the large-scale linguistic resources of Universal Dependencies and UniMorph. MultiBLiMP 1.0 evaluates abilities of LLMs at an unprecedented multilingual scale, and highlights the shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art in modelling low-resource languages.

- **[AnesBench: Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of LLM Reasoning in Anesthesiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02404)**  `arXiv:2504.02404`  `cs.CL`  
  _Xiang Feng, Wentao Jiang, Zengmao Wang, Yong Luo, Pingbo Xu, Baosheng Yu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of large language models (LLMs) in the medical field has gained significant attention, yet their reasoning capabilities in more specialized domains like anesthesiology remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in anesthesiology and analyze key factors influencing their performance. To this end, we introduce AnesBench, a cross-lingual benchmark designed to assess anesthesiology-related reasoning across three levels: factual retrieval (System 1), hybrid reasoning (System 1.x), and complex decision-making (System 2). Through extensive experiments, we first explore how model characteristics, including model scale, Chain of Thought (CoT) length, and language transferability, affect reasoning performance. Then, we further evaluate the effectiveness of different training strategies, leveraging our curated anesthesiology-related dataset, including continuous pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we also investigate how the test-time reasoning techniques, such as Best-of-N sampling and beam search, influence reasoning performance, and assess the impact of reasoning-enhanced model distillation, specifically DeepSeek-R1. We will publicly release AnesBench, along with our CPT and SFT training datasets and evaluation code atthis https URL.

- **[Multi-Mission Tool Bench: Assessing the Robustness of LLM based Agents through Related and Dynamic Missions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02623)**  `arXiv:2504.02623`  `cs.AI`  
  _PeiJie Yu, Yifan Yang, Jinjian Li, Zelong Zhang, Haorui Wang, Xiao Feng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential as agents for tool invocation due to their advanced comprehension and planning capabilities. Users increasingly rely on LLM-based agents to solve complex missions through iterative interactions. However, existing benchmarks predominantly access agents in single-mission scenarios, failing to capture real-world complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Mission Tool Bench. In the benchmark, each test case comprises multiple interrelated missions. This design requires agents to dynamically adapt to evolving demands. Moreover, the proposed benchmark explores all possible mission-switching patterns within a fixed mission number. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent data generation framework to construct the benchmark. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of agent decisions with dynamic decision trees. Experiments on diverse open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal critical factors influencing agent robustness and provide actionable insights to the tool invocation society.
