- **[FLARE: Robot Learning with Implicit World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15659)**  `arXiv:2505.15659`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce $\textbf{F}$uture $\textbf{LA}$tent $\textbf{RE}$presentation Alignment ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel framework that integrates predictive latent world modeling into robot policy learning. By aligning features from a diffusion transformer with latent embeddings of future observations, $\textbf{FLARE}$ enables a diffusion transformer policy to anticipate latent representations of future observations, allowing it to reason about long-term consequences while generating actions. Remarkably lightweight, $\textbf{FLARE}$ requires only minimal architectural modifications -- adding a few tokens to standard vision-language-action (VLA) models -- yet delivers substantial performance gains. Across two challenging multitask simulation imitation learning benchmarks spanning single-arm and humanoid tabletop manipulation, $\textbf{FLARE}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior policy learning baselines by up to 26%. Moreover, $\textbf{FLARE}$ unlocks the ability to co-train with human egocentric video demonstrations without action labels, significantly boosting policy generalization to a novel object with unseen geometry with as few as a single robot demonstration. Our results establish $\textbf{FLARE}$ as a general and scalable approach for combining implicit world modeling with high-frequency robotic control.

  Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental challenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While prior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context of manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning cross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and push-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test generalization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a robot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on a robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on combinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of different RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to novel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can outperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to unseen morphologies is feasible, and how consistently these patterns hold across different generalization regimes. The results highlight the current limitations of multi-embodiment learning and provide insights into how architectural and training design choices influence policy generalization.

- **[Exploring the Limits of Vision-Language-Action Manipulations in Cross-task Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15660)**  `arXiv:2505.15660`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The generalization capabilities of vision-language-action (VLA) models to unseen tasks are crucial to achieving general-purpose robotic manipulation in open-world settings. However, the cross-task generalization capabilities of existing VLA models remain significantly underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AGNOSTOS, a novel simulation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate cross-task zero-shot generalization in manipulation. AGNOSTOS comprises 23 unseen manipulation tasks for testing, distinct from common training task distributions, and incorporates two levels of generalization difficulty to assess robustness. Our systematic evaluation reveals that current VLA models, despite being trained on diverse datasets, struggle to generalize effectively to these unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Cross-Task In-Context Manipulation (X-ICM), a method that conditions large language models (LLMs) on in-context demonstrations from seen tasks to predict action sequences for unseen tasks. Additionally, we introduce a dynamics-guided sample selection strategy that identifies relevant demonstrations by capturing cross-task dynamics. On AGNOSTOS, X-ICM significantly improves cross-task zero-shot generalization performance over leading VLAs. We believe AGNOSTOS and X-ICM will serve as valuable tools for advancing general-purpose robotic manipulation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world validation hinders accurate perception and robust step-by-step reasoning. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with dynamic, agent-style tool invocation for autonomous driving tasks. AgentThink's core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline}, employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to equip VLMs with the capability for autonomous tool invocation; and \textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by \textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation studies and robust zero-shot/few-shot generalization experiments across various benchmarks underscore its powerful capabilities. These findings highlight a promising trajectory for developing trustworthy and tool-aware autonomous driving models.

- **[Learning-based Autonomous Oversteer Control and Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15275)**  `arXiv:2505.15275`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.LG`  
  _Seokjun Lee, Seung-Hyun Kong_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce unintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer control with obstacle avoidance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot, task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions - based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710 questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.

- **[UAV-Flow Colosseo: A Real-World Benchmark for Flying-on-a-Word UAV Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15725)**  `arXiv:2505.15725`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are evolving into language-interactive platforms, enabling more intuitive forms of human-drone interaction. While prior works have primarily focused on high-level planning and long-horizon navigation, we shift attention to language-guided fine-grained trajectory control, where UAVs execute short-range, reactive flight behaviors in response to language instructions. We formalize this problem as the Flying-on-a-Word (Flow) task and introduce UAV imitation learning as an effective approach. In this framework, UAVs learn fine-grained control policies by mimicking expert pilot trajectories paired with atomic language instructions. To support this paradigm, we present UAV-Flow, the first real-world benchmark for language-conditioned, fine-grained UAV control. It includes a task formulation, a large-scale dataset collected in diverse environments, a deployable control framework, and a simulation suite for systematic evaluation. Our design enables UAVs to closely imitate the precise, expert-level flight trajectories of human pilots and supports direct deployment without sim-to-real gap. We conduct extensive experiments on UAV-Flow, benchmarking VLN and VLA paradigms. Results show that VLA models are superior to VLN baselines and highlight the critical role of spatial grounding in the fine-grained Flow setting.

- **[Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning for Efficient Robotic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15304)**  `arXiv:2505.15304`  `cs.RO`  
  _Seongmin Park, Hyungmin Kim, Sangwoo kim, Wonseok Jeon, Juyoung Yang, Byeongwook Jeon, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural network (DNN)-based policy models, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models, excel at automating complex decision-making from multi-modal inputs. However, scaling these models greatly increases computational overhead, complicating deployment in resource-constrained settings like robot manipulation and autonomous driving. To address this, we propose Saliency-Aware Quantized Imitation Learning (SQIL), which combines quantization-aware training with a selective loss-weighting strategy for mission-critical states. By identifying these states via saliency scores and emphasizing them in the training loss, SQIL preserves decision fidelity under low-bit precision. We validate SQIL's generalization capability across extensive simulation benchmarks with environment variations, real-world tasks, and cross-domain tasks (self-driving, physics simulation), consistently recovering full-precision performance. Notably, a 4-bit weight-quantized VLA model for robotic manipulation achieves up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings on an edge GPU with minimal accuracy loss. These results underline SQIL's potential for efficiently deploying large IL-based policy models on resource-limited devices.

- **[GCNT: Graph-Based Transformer Policies for Morphology-Agnostic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15211)**  `arXiv:2505.15211`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yingbo Luo, Meibao Yao, Xueming Xiao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training a universal controller for robots with different morphologies is a promising research trend, since it can significantly enhance the robustness and resilience of the robotic system. However, diverse morphologies can yield different dimensions of state space and action space, making it difficult to comply with traditional policy networks. Existing methods address this issue by modularizing the robot configuration, while do not adequately extract and utilize the overall morphological information, which has been proven crucial for training a universal controller. To this end, we propose GCNT, a morphology-agnostic policy network based on improved Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer. It exploits the fact that GCN and Transformer can handle arbitrary number of modules to achieve compatibility with diverse morphologies. Our key insight is that the GCN is able to efficiently extract morphology information of robots, while Transformer ensures that it is fully utilized by allowing each node of the robot to communicate this information directly. Experimental results show that our method can generate resilient locomotion behaviors for robots with different configurations, including zero-shot generalization to robot morphologies not seen during training. In particular, GCNT achieved the best performance on 8 tasks in the 2 standard benchmarks.

- **[Histo-Planner: A Real-time Local Planner for MAVs Teleoperation based on Histogram of Obstacle Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15043)**  `arXiv:2505.15043`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ze Wang, Zhenyu Gao, Jingang Qu, Pascal Morin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper concerns real-time obstacle avoidance for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Motivated by teleoperation applications in cluttered environments with limited computational power, we propose a local planner that does not require the knowledge or construction of a global map of the obstacles. The proposed solution consists of a real-time trajectory planning algorithm that relies on the histogram of obstacle distribution and a planner manager that triggers different planning modes depending on obstacles location around the MAV. The proposed solution is validated, for a teleoperation application, with both simulations and indoor experiments. Benchmark comparisons based on a designed simulation platform are also provided.

- **[Towards Real-world Debiasing: Rethinking Evaluation, Challenge, and Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15240)**  `arXiv:2405.15240`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Peng Kuang, Zhibo Wang, Zhixuan Chu, Jingyi Wang, Kui Ren_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spurious correlations in training data significantly hinder the generalization capability of machine learning models when faced with distribution shifts, leading to the proposition of numberous debiasing methods. However, it remains to be asked: \textit{Do existing benchmarks for debiasing really represent biases in the real world?} Recent works attempt to address such concerns by sampling from real-world data (instead of synthesizing) according to some predefined biased distributions to ensure the realism of individual samples. However, the realism of the biased distribution is more critical yet challenging and underexplored due to the complexity of real-world bias distributions. To tackle the problem, we propose a fine-grained framework for analyzing biased distributions, based on which we empirically and theoretically identify key characteristics of biased distributions in the real world that are poorly represented by existing benchmarks. Towards applicable debiasing in the real world, we further introduce two novel real-world-inspired biases to bridge this gap and build a systematic evaluation framework for real-world debiasing, RDBench\footnote{RDBench: Code to be released. Preliminary version in supplementary material for anonimized review.}. Furthermore, focusing on the practical setting of debiasing w/o bias label, we find real-world biases pose a novel \textit{Sparse bias capturing} challenge to the existing paradigm. We propose a simple yet effective approach named Debias in Destruction (DiD), to address the challenge, whose effectiveness is validated with extensive experiments on 8 datasets of various biased distributions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

- **[Plain Transformers Can be Powerful Graph Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12588)**  `arXiv:2504.12588`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Liheng Ma, Soumyasundar Pal, Yingxue Zhang, Philip H.S. Torr, Mark Coates_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, owing to their simple but powerful scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers (GTs) have strayed far from plain Transformers, exhibiting major architectural differences either by integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for Transformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work demonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph learner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and easy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to construct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$ attention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its theoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on the empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more complicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs. Its outstanding empirical performance across various graph datasets also justifies the practical effectiveness of PPGT.

- **[FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01068)**  `arXiv:2502.01068`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Dongwon Jo, Jiwon Song, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial key-value (KV) caches to store contextual information, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage. Previous efforts to compress these KV caches primarily focused on reducing memory demands but were limited in enhancing latency. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression method designed to reduce latency for long-context inference. FastKV improves processing speed while preserving accuracy by adopting Token-Selective Propagation (TSP). This approach preserves full-context information in early layers of LLMs and selectively propagates only a portion of this information in later layers. This design enables FastKV to minimize redundant computation without sacrificing contextual fidelity. Our experimental results show that FastKV achieves up to 1.97$\times$ and 4.82$\times$ improvements in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and throughput, respectively, compared to baseline without KV cache compression. Moreover, FastKV successfully maintains accuracy within 1\% of the baseline on long-context benchmarks. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Flattening Hierarchies with Policy Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14975)**  `arXiv:2505.14975`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _John L. Zhou, Jonathan C. Kao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

- **[Large Language Models as Computable Approximations to Solomonoff Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15784)**  `arXiv:2505.15784`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Jun Wan, Lingrui Mei_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable insights for future model development.

- **[Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15311)**  `arXiv:2505.15311`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Yurun Yuan, Fan Chen, Zeyu Jia, Alexander Rakhlin, Tengyang Xie_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

- **[RL Tango: Reinforcing Generator and Verifier Together for Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15034)**  `arXiv:2505.15034`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Kaiwen Zha, Zhengqi Gao, Maohao Shen, Zhang-Wei Hong, Duane S. Boning, Dina Katabi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at:this https URL.

- **[Scalable Chain of Thoughts via Elastic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05315)**  `arXiv:2505.05315`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritizes the completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in unconstrained settings. Our code has been made available atthis https URL.

- **[Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24370)**  `arXiv:2503.24370`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We find that the Thinking Intervention paradigm enhances the capabilities of reasoning models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction following on IFEval and Overthinking, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SorryBench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.

  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and by inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into markdown-formatted plain text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, a population distinct from that used to train CLMBR-T-Base. Notably, one of the tested LLM-based models achieves superior performance for disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality prediction, highlighting robustness to shifts in patient populations. Our findings suggest that repurposed general-purpose LLMs for EHR encoding provide a scalable and generalizable alternative to domain-specific models for clinical prediction.

  Dataset contamination, where evaluation datasets overlap with pre-training corpora, inflates performance metrics and undermines the reliability of model evaluations. Measuring dataset contamination thus becomes essential to ensure that performance evaluations genuinely reflect a model's ability to generalize to unseen data, rather than relying on memorized examples. To address this problem, we propose Kernel Divergence Score (KDS), a novel method that evaluates dataset contamination by computing the divergence between the kernel similarity matrix of sample embeddings, before and after fine-tuning on the benchmark dataset. Leveraging the insight that fine-tuning affects unseen samples more significantly than seen ones, KDS provides a reliable measure of contamination. Through extensive experiments on controlled contamination scenarios, KDS demonstrates a near-perfect correlation with contamination levels and outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we perform comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of key design choices, providing deeper insights into the components and effectiveness of KDS. These ablations highlight the importance of leveraging fine-grained kernel-based information and confirm the reliability of the proposed framework across diverse datasets and settings.

  Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning curves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe significant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a challenging benchmark for future research.

  Neural network architectures have a large impact in machine learning. In reinforcement learning, network architectures have remained notably simple, as changes often lead to small gains in performance. This work introduces a novel encoder architecture for pixel-based model-free reinforcement learning. The Hadamax (\textbf{Hada}mard \textbf{max}-pooling) encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance by max-pooling Hadamard products between GELU-activated parallel hidden layers. Based on the recent PQN algorithm, the Hadamax encoder achieves state-of-the-art model-free performance in the Atari-57 benchmark. Specifically, without applying any algorithmic hyperparameter modifications, Hadamax-PQN achieves an 80\% performance gain over vanilla PQN and significantly surpasses Rainbow-DQN.

  Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%.

  Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates infinite-horizon average reward Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with general parametrization. We propose a Primal-Dual Natural Actor-Critic algorithm that adeptly manages constraints while ensuring a high convergence rate. In particular, our algorithm achieves global convergence and constraint violation rates of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ over a horizon of length $T$ when the mixing time, $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, is known to the learner. In absence of knowledge of $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, the achievable rates change to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{0.5-\epsilon})$ provided that $T \geq \tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}^{2/\epsilon}\right)$. Our results match the theoretical lower bound for Markov Decision Processes and establish a new benchmark in the theoretical exploration of average reward CMDPs.

  Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL, without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples. Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any labeled data or even any parameter updates.

  _Yangchao Wu, Zongyue Qin, Alex Wong, Stefano Soatto_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency to improve the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models by enabling multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass. State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers, since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently. We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead to current SSM state update implementations. With the algorithm, we describe a hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Toto uses a modern decoder-only architecture coupled with architectural innovations designed to account for specific challenges found in multivariate observability time series data. Toto's pre-training corpus is a mixture of observability data, open datasets, and synthetic data, and is 4-10$\times$ larger than those of leading time series foundation models. Additionally, we introduce BOOM, a large-scale benchmark consisting of 350 million observations across 2,807 real-world time series. For both Toto and BOOM, we source observability data exclusively from Datadog's own telemetry and internal observability metrics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Toto achieves state-of-the-art performance on both BOOM and on established general purpose time series forecasting benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline safe reinforcement learning(OSRL) derives constraint-satisfying policies from pre-collected datasets, offers a promising avenue for deploying RL in safety-critical real-world domains such as robotics. However, the majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost, which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors. Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation. Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks, particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.

  Post-training Quantization (PTQ) technique has been extensively adopted for large language models (LLMs) compression owing to its efficiency and low resource requirement. However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluationthis http URLcomparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness.

  State-of-the-art (SOTA) reinforcement learning (RL) methods have enabled vision-language model (VLM) agents to learn from interaction with online environments without human supervision. However, these methods often struggle with learning inefficiencies when applied to complex, real-world decision-making tasks with sparse rewards and long-horizon dependencies. We propose a novel framework, Variational Subgoal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (VSC-RL), advancing the VLM agents in resolving challenging decision-making tasks. Fundamentally distinct from existing methods, VSC-RL reformulates the decision-making problem as a variational subgoal-conditioned RL problem with the newly derived optimization objective, Subgoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which comprises two key components: (a) maximizing the subgoal-conditioned return, and (b) minimizing the divergence from a reference goal-conditioned policy. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the VSC-RL can efficiently improve the learning efficiency without compromising performance guarantees. Across a diverse set of challenging benchmarks, including mobile device and web control tasks, VSC-RL consistently outperforms existing SOTA methods, achieving superior learning efficiency and performance.

  Link prediction for directed graphs is a crucial task with diverse real-world applications. Recent advances in embedding methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising improvements. However, these methods often lack a thorough analysis of their expressiveness and suffer from effective benchmarks for a fair evaluation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to assess the expressiveness of existing methods, highlighting the impact of dual embeddings and decoder design on directed link prediction performance. To address limitations in current benchmark setups, we introduce DirLinkBench, a robust new benchmark with comprehensive coverage, standardized evaluation, and modular extensibility. The results on DirLinkBench show that current methods struggle to achieve strong performance, while DiGAE outperforms other baselines overall. We further revisit DiGAE theoretically, showing its graph convolution aligns with GCN on an undirected bipartite graph. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel Spectral Directed Graph Auto-Encoder SDGAE that achieves state-of-the-art average performance on DirLinkBench. Finally, we analyze key factors influencing directed link prediction and highlight open challenges in this field.

  Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is increasingly large en- ergy consumption during the search process. Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model. Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i) reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results. Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection, returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study, we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy- aware surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to 8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the device.

  The rise of IoT has increased the need for on-edge machine learning, with TinyML emerging as a promising solution for resource-constrained devices such as MCU. However, evaluating their performance remains challenging due to diverse architectures and application scenarios. Current solutions have many non-negligible limitations. This work introduces an alternative benchmarking methodology that integrates energy and latency measurements while distinguishing three execution phases pre-inference, inference, and post-inference. Additionally, the setup ensures that the device operates without being powered by an external measurement unit, while automated testing can be leveraged to enhance statistical significance. To evaluate our setup, we tested the STM32N6 MCU, which includes a NPU for executing neural networks. Two configurations were considered: high-performance and Low-power. The variation of the EDP was analyzed separately for each phase, providing insights into the impact of hardware configurations on energy efficiency. Each model was tested 1000 times to ensure statistically relevant results. Our findings demonstrate that reducing the core voltage and clock frequency improve the efficiency of pre- and post-processing without significantly affecting network execution performance. This approach can also be used for cross-platform comparisons to determine the most efficient inference platform and to quantify how pre- and post-processing overhead varies across different hardware implementations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial representations --such as simplicial or cellular complexes-- to accommodate higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order Positional and Structural Encoder)--a \emph{message passing-free} framework that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path for scalable TDL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) faces critical challenges, particularly in heterogeneous environments where non-independent and identically distributed data across clients can lead to unfair and inefficient model performance. In this work, we introduce \textit{DRDM}, a novel algorithm that addresses these issues by combining a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework with dynamic regularization to mitigate client drift. \textit{DRDM} frames the training as a min-max optimization problem aimed at maximizing performance for the worst-case client, thereby promoting robustness and fairness. This robust objective is optimized through an algorithm leveraging dynamic regularization and efficient local updates, which significantly reduces the required number of communication rounds. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for convex smooth objectives under partial participation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, covering various model architectures and data heterogeneity levels, demonstrate that \textit{DRDM} significantly improves worst-case test accuracy while requiring fewer communication rounds than existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth on the energy consumption of participating clients, demonstrating that the number of local update steps can be adaptively selected to achieve a target worst-case test accuracy with minimal total energy cost across diverse communication environments.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on multi-step mathematical reasoning, yet at the cost of high computational overhead. This challenge is particularly acute for test-time scaling methods such as parallel decoding, which increase answer diversity but scale poorly in efficiency. To address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose SSR (Speculative Parallel Scaling Reasoning), a training-free framework that leverages a key insight: by introducing speculative decoding at the step level, we can accelerate reasoning without sacrificing correctness. SSR integrates two components: a Selective Parallel Module (SPM) that identifies a small set of promising reasoning strategies via model-internal scoring, and Step-level Speculative Decoding (SSD), which enables efficient draft-target collaboration for fine-grained reasoning acceleration. Experiments on three mathematical benchmarks-AIME 2024, MATH-500, and LiveMathBench - demonstrate that SSR achieves strong gains over baselines. For instance, on LiveMathBench, SSR improves pass@1 accuracy by 13.84% while reducing computation to 80.5% of the baseline FLOPs. On MATH-500, SSR reduces compute to only 30% with no loss in accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency and sample diversity compared to baselines. For instance, on a challenging sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately 99\%.

  Many natural systems, including neural circuits involved in decision making, can be modeled as high-dimensional dynamical systems with multiple stable states. While existing analytical tools primarily describe behavior near stable equilibria, characterizing separatrices -- the manifolds that delineate boundaries between different basins of attraction -- remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a numerical framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and recurrent neural networks trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks. Moreover, we illustrate the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic stimulation experiments in neuroscience.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM (Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced feature representations throughout the network.

  _Jiawei Gu, Ziyue Qiao, Zechao Li_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task of graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying graph neural networks in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps (the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right) \mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional training or model modification.

  Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use; and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes, often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization (reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation. Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness, with significantly lower training and inference times.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which, however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD, DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning histories.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant advancements through the application of various neural network architectures. In this study, we systematically investigate the performance of several neural networks in RL tasks, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Mamba/Mamba-2, Transformer-XL, Gated Transformer-XL, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Through comprehensive evaluation across continuous control, discrete decision-making, and memory-based environments, we identify architecture-specific strengths and limitations. Our results reveal that: (1) MLPs excel in fully observable continuous control tasks, providing an optimal balance of performance and efficiency; (2) recurrent architectures like LSTM and GRU offer robust performance in partially observable environments with moderate memory requirements; (3) Mamba models achieve a 4.5x higher throughput compared to LSTM and a 3.9x increase over GRU, all while maintaining comparable performance; and (4) only Transformer-XL, Gated Transformer-XL, and Mamba-2 successfully solve the most challenging memory-intensive tasks, with Mamba-2 requiring 8x less memory than Transformer-XL. These findings provide insights for researchers and practitioners, enabling more informed architecture selection based on specific task characteristics and computational constraints.

  Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT, an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The pursuit of alpha returns that exceed market benchmarks has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from intuition-driven investing to autonomous, AI powered systems. This paper introduces a comprehensive five stage taxonomy that traces this progression across manual strategies, statistical models, classical machine learning, deep learning, and agentic architectures powered by large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior surveys focused narrowly on modeling techniques, this review adopts a system level lens, integrating advances in representation learning, multimodal data fusion, and tool augmented LLM agents. The strategic shift from static predictors to contextaware financial agents capable of real time reasoning, scenario simulation, and cross modal decision making is emphasized. Key challenges in interpretability, data fragility, governance, and regulatory compliance areas critical to production deployment are examined. The proposed taxonomy offers a unified framework for evaluating maturity, aligning infrastructure, and guiding the responsible development of next generation alpha systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many deep architectures and self-supervised pre-training techniques have been proposed for human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable multimodal sensors. Scaling laws have the potential to help move towards more principled design by linking model capacity with pre-training data volume. Yet, scaling laws have not been established for HAR to the same extent as in language and vision. By conducting an exhaustive grid search on both amount of pre-training data and Transformer architectures, we establish the first known scaling laws for HAR. We show that pre-training loss scales with a power law relationship to amount of data and parameter count and that increasing the number of users in a dataset results in a steeper improvement in performance than increasing data per user, indicating that diversity of pre-training data is important, which contrasts to some previously reported findings in self-supervised HAR. We show that these scaling laws translate to downstream performance improvements on three HAR benchmark datasets of postures, modes of locomotion and activities of daily living: UCI HAR and WISDM Phone and WISDM Watch. Finally, we suggest some previously published works should be revisited in light of these scaling laws with more adequate model capacities.

  Federated graph learning is an emerging field with significant practical challenges. While algorithms have been proposed to improve the accuracy of training graph neural networks, such as node classification on federated graphs, the system performance is often overlooked, despite it is crucial for real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce FedGraph, a research library designed for practical distributed training and comprehensive benchmarking of FGL algorithms. FedGraph supports a range of state-of-the-art graph learning methods and includes a monitoring class that evaluates system performance, with a particular focus on communication and computation costs during training. Unlike existing federated learning platforms, FedGraph natively integrates homomorphic encryption to enhance privacy preservation and supports scalable deployment across multiple physical machines with system-level performance evaluation to guide the system design of future algorithms. To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank communication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training communication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases. Extensive experiments benchmark different FGL algorithms on three major graph learning tasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support encrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.

  Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for conditional sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods.

  Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.

  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents by leveraging language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.

  Autonomous vehicles rely on HD maps for their operation, but offline HD maps eventually become outdated. For this reason, online HD map construction methods use live sensor data to infer map information instead. Research on real map changes shows that oftentimes entire parts of an HD map remain unchanged and can be used as a prior. We therefore introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map completion both with and without offline HD map priors. As a necessary foundation, we address shortcomings in ground truth labels for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first comprehensive benchmark for HD map completion. Unlike existing models that specialize in a single kind of map change, which is unrealistic for deployment, our Generalist model handles all kinds of changes, matching the effectiveness of Expert models. With our map masking as augmentation regime, we can even achieve a +1.4 mAP improvement without a prior. Finally, by fully utilizing prior HD map elements and optimizing query designs, M3TR outperforms existing methods by +4.3 mAP while being the first real-world deployable model for offline HD map priors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer. Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets, with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art approaches applied to this setting.this http URL.

  The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures: a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy, outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

  Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast" vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A), which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X, TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

  Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.

  Recent agentic language models increasingly need to interact directly with real-world environments containing intertwined visual and textual information through raw camera pixels, rather than relying on separate image and tokenized text processing, underscoring the necessity of a unified perception paradigm. To close this gap, we explore this idea through Perceive Everything as Pixels (PEAP) and release PixelWorld, a benchmark that renders natural-language, tabular, mathematical and diagrammatic inputs into a single pixel space. Experiments show that PEAP attains competitive accuracy on semantic-understanding tasks, indicating that a vision transformer can capture global textual semantics without explicit tokens. In contrast, reasoning-intensive benchmarks (math and code) exhibit sharp performance drops; however, Chain-of-Thought prompting partially mitigates this gap, hinting that explicit reasoning traces compensate for the missing token structure. We also find that when visual and textual information are closely integrated, representing everything as pixels reduces preprocessing complexity and avoids misalignment issues that often arise in separate pipelines. PixelWorld therefore serves as a practical benchmark for evaluating unified vision-language models and supports broader exploration of PEAP across diverse tasks.

  Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical contexts remains under-explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100 contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies, accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100 percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms, misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

  The releases of OpenAI's o-[n] series, such as o1, o3, and o4-mini, mark a significant paradigm shift in Large Language Models towards advanced reasoning capabilities. Notably, models like o3 have demonstrated strong performance on benchmarks like the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI). However, this benchmark is limited to symbolic patterns, whereas humans often perceive and reason about multimodal scenarios involving both vision and language data. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate advanced reasoning capabilities in multimodal tasks. To this end, we track the evolution of the GPT-[n] and o-[n] series models (including o1, o3, and o4-mini) on challenging multimodal puzzles from PuzzleVQA and AlgoPuzzleVQA, which demand fine-grained visual perception. Our results reveal that o-[n] series, particularly later iterations like o3 and o4-mini, significantly outperform the GPT-[n] series and show strong scalability in multimodal reasoning. Nonetheless, despite these substantial advancements and the superior capabilities demonstrated by the o-[n] series, our findings highlight that even these leading models face persistent challenges. Difficulties are particularly evident in tasks requiring precise visual perception, robust compositional reasoning across multiple visual attributes, and solving complex algorithmic or highly combinatorial puzzles, indicating critical areas for future AGI development.

  Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2 benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight architecture.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets.

  Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however, video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME, LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably, ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Road safety is a critical challenge, particularly for cyclists, who are among the most vulnerable road users. This study aims to enhance road safety by proposing a novel benchmark for bicycle occlusion level classification using advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing a parts-based detection model, images are annotated and processed through a custom image detection pipeline. A novel method of bicycle occlusion level is proposed to objectively quantify the visibility and occlusion level of bicycle semantic parts. The findings indicate that the model robustly quantifies the visibility and occlusion level of bicycles, a significant improvement over the subjective methods used by the current state of the art. Widespread use of the proposed methodology will facilitate the accurate performance reporting of cyclist detection algorithms for occluded cyclists, informing the development of more robust vulnerable road user detection methods for autonomous vehicles.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity, identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.

  End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving systems offer a promising alternative to traditional modular pipelines by reducing information loss and error accumulation, with significant potential to enhance both mobility and safety. However, most existing E2E approaches directly generate plans based on dense bird's-eye view (BEV) grid features, leading to inefficiency and limited planning awareness. To address these limitations, we propose iterative Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data. Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks - mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading methods.

  _Georgiana Manolache, Gerard Schouten, Joaquin Vanschoren_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present CrypticBio, the largest publicly available multimodal dataset of visually confusing species, specifically curated to support the development of AI models in the context of biodiversity applications. Visually confusing or cryptic species are groups of two or more taxa that are nearly indistinguishable based on visual characteristics alone. While much existing work addresses taxonomic identification in a broad sense, datasets that directly address the morphological confusion of cryptic species are small, manually curated, and target only a single taxon. Thus, the challenge of identifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains unaddressed. Curated from real-world trends in species misidentification among community annotators of iNaturalist, CrypticBio contains 52K unique cryptic groups spanning 67K species, represented in 166 million images. Rich research-grade image annotations--including scientific, multicultural, and multilingual species terminology, hierarchical taxonomy, spatiotemporal context, and associated cryptic groups--address multimodal AI in biodiversity research. For easy dataset curation, we provide an open-source pipeline CrypticBio-Curate. The multimodal nature of the dataset beyond vision-language arises from the integration of geographical and temporal data as complementary cues to identifying cryptic species. To highlight the importance of the dataset, we benchmark a suite of state-of-the-art foundation models across CrypticBio subsets of common, unseen, endangered, and invasive species, and demonstrate the substantial impact of geographical context on vision-language zero-shot learning for cryptic species. By introducing CrypticBio, we aim to catalyze progress toward real-world-ready biodiversity AI models capable of handling the nuanced challenges of species ambiguity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However, the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64 vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization capacity in downstream. The project page is atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions. To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic differences. We construct a comprehensive dataset, termed FineHARD, by integrating high-quality region-specific annotations with hard fine-grained negative samples. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and improving overall model performance. The data, code, and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.

  The intrication of brain signals drives research that leverages multimodal AI to align brain modalities with visual and textual data for explainable descriptions. However, most existing studies are limited to coarse interpretations, lacking essential details on object descriptions, locations, attributes, and their relationships. This leads to imprecise and ambiguous reconstructions when using such cues for visual decoding. To address this, we analyze different choices of vision feature spaces from pre-trained visual components within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and introduce a zero-shot multimodal brain decoding method that interacts with these models to decode across multiple levels of granularities. % To assess a model's ability to decode fine details from brain signals, we propose the Multi-Granularity Brain Detail Understanding Benchmark (MG-BrainDub). This benchmark includes two key tasks: detailed descriptions and salient question-answering, with metrics highlighting key visual elements like objects, attributes, and relationships. Our approach enhances neural decoding precision and supports more accurate neuro-decoding applications. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scene text detection has seen the emergence of high-performing methods that excel on academic benchmarks. However, these detectors often fail to replicate such success in real-world scenarios. We uncover two key factors contributing to this discrepancy through extensive experiments. First, a \textit{Fine-tuning Gap}, where models leverage \textit{Dataset-Specific Optimization} (DSO) paradigm for one domain at the cost of reduced effectiveness in others, leads to inflated performances on academic benchmarks. Second, the suboptimal performance in practical settings is primarily attributed to the long-tailed distribution of texts, where detectors struggle with rare and complex categories as artistic or overlapped text. Given that the DSO paradigm might undermine the generalization ability of models, we advocate for a \textit{Joint-Dataset Learning} (JDL) protocol to alleviate the Fine-tuning Gap. Additionally, an error analysis is conducted to identify three major categories and 13 subcategories of challenges in long-tailed scene text, upon which we propose a Long-Tailed Benchmark (LTB). LTB facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of ability to handle a diverse range of long-tailed challenges. We further introduce MAEDet, a self-supervised learning-based method, as a strong baseline for LTB. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Malocclusion is a major challenge in orthodontics, and its complex presentation and diverse clinical manifestations make accurate localization and diagnosis particularly important. Currently, one of the major shortcomings facing the field of dental image analysis is the lack of large-scale, accurately labeled datasets dedicated to malocclusion issues, which limits the development of automated diagnostics in the field of dentistry and leads to a lack of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice. Therefore, in this study, we propose the Oral and Maxillofacial Natural Images (OMNI) dataset, a novel and comprehensive dental image dataset aimed at advancing the study of analyzing dental images for issues of malocclusion. Specifically, the dataset contains 4166 multi-view images with 384 participants in data collection and annotated by professional dentists. In addition, we performed a comprehensive validation of the created OMNI dataset, including three CNN-based methods, two Transformer-based methods, and one GNN-based method, and conducted automated diagnostic experiments for malocclusion issues. The experimental results show that the OMNI dataset can facilitate the automated diagnosis research of malocclusion issues and provide a new benchmark for the research in this field. Our OMNI dataset and baseline code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Generalization of deep-learning-based (DL) computer vision algorithms to various image perturbations is hard to establish and remains an active area of research. The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured, whereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less studied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of capture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model performance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common vision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\textbf{S}$hutter speed, ISO se$\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of objects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled camera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show the effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we conduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our results show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models trained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed images, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute variations of camera settings.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advances in integrating visual and linguistic information, yet their ability to reason about complex and real-world scenarios remains limited. The existing benchmarks are usually constructed in the task-oriented manner without guarantee that different task samples come from the same data distribution, thus they often fall short in evaluating the synergistic effects of lower-level perceptual capabilities on higher-order reasoning. To lift this limitation, we contribute Lens, a multi-level benchmark with 3.4K contemporary images and 60K+ human-authored questions covering eight tasks and 12 daily scenarios, forming three progressive task tiers, i.e., perception, understanding, and reasoning. One feature is that each image is equipped with rich annotations for all tasks. Thus, this dataset intrinsically supports to evaluate MLLMs to handle image-invariable prompts, from basic perception to compositional reasoning. In addition, our images are manully collected from the social media, in which 53% were published later than Jan. 2025. We evaluate 15+ frontier MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B, InternVL3-78B, GPT-4o and two reasoning models QVQ-72B-preview and Kimi-VL. These models are released later than Dec. 2024, and none of them achieve an accuracy greater than 60% in the reasoning tasks. Project page:this https URL. ICCV 2025 workshop page:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Language Models (VLMs) employed for visual question-answering (VQA) in autonomous driving often require substantial computational resources that pose a challenge for their deployment in resource-constrained vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce TinyDrive, a lightweight yet effective VLM for multi-view VQA in driving scenarios. Our model comprises two key components including a multiscale vision encoder and a dual-level prioritization mechanism for tokens and sequences. The multiscale encoder facilitates the processing of multi-view images at diverse resolutions through scale injection and cross-scale gating to generate enhanced visual representations. At the token level, we design a token routing mechanism that dynamically selects and process the most informative tokens based on learned importance scores. At the sequence level, we propose integrating normalized loss, uncertainty estimates, and a diversity metric to formulate sequence scores that rank and preserve samples within a sequence priority buffer. Samples with higher scores are more frequently selected for training. TinyDrive is first evaluated on our custom-curated VQA dataset, and it is subsequently tested on the public DriveLM benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art language understanding performance. Notably, it achieves relative improvements of 11.1% and 35.4% in BLEU-4 and METEOR scores, respectively, despite having a significantly smaller parameter count.

  _Jianyuan Guo, Peike Li, Trevor Cohn_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to map sign language videos to spoken language text. A common approach relies on gloss annotations as an intermediate representation, decomposing SLT into two sub-tasks: video-to-gloss recognition and gloss-to-text translation. While effective, this paradigm depends on expert-annotated gloss labels, which are costly and rarely available in existing datasets, limiting its scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a gloss-free pseudo gloss generation framework that eliminates the need for human-annotated glosses while preserving the structured intermediate representation. Specifically, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with a few example text-gloss pairs using in-context learning to produce draft sign glosses from spoken language text. To enhance the correspondence between LLM-generated pseudo glosses and the sign sequences in video, we correct the ordering in the pseudo glosses for better alignment via a weakly supervised learning process. This reordering facilitates the incorporation of auxiliary alignment objectives, and allows for the use of efficient supervision via a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We train our SLT mode, which consists of a vision encoder and a translator, through a three-stage pipeline, which progressively narrows the modality gap between sign language and spoken language. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art gloss-free frameworks on two SLT benchmarks and achieves competitive results compared to gloss-based methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a variety of computer vision tasks. However, the multimodal reasoning capability has not been fully explored in existing models. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Focus (CoF) method that allows VLMs to perform adaptive focusing and zooming in on key image regions based on obtained visual cues and the given questions, achieving efficient multimodal reasoning. To enable this CoF capability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent designed to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with different image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the Qwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome accuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling further refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human priors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On the V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model outperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to 4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating the more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.

  Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations of objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human aging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal perception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a deeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the current powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about temporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the causal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our TimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have achieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on various standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly behind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors. Furthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality compared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical need to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of VLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM community moving forward.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Vision-Language Models (MVLMs) have achieved par excellence generalization in medical image analysis, yet their performance under noisy, corrupted conditions remains largely untested. Clinical imaging is inherently susceptible to acquisition artifacts and noise; however, existing evaluations predominantly assess generally clean datasets, overlooking robustness -- i.e., the model's ability to perform under real-world distortions. To address this gap, we first introduce MediMeta-C, a corruption benchmark that systematically applies several perturbations across multiple medical imaging datasets. Combined with MedMNIST-C, this establishes a comprehensive robustness evaluation framework for MVLMs. We further propose RobustMedCLIP, a visual encoder adaptation of a pretrained MVLM that incorporates few-shot tuning to enhance resilience against corruptions. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 5 major MVLMs across 5 medical imaging modalities, revealing that existing models exhibit severe degradation under corruption and struggle with domain-modality tradeoffs. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse training and robust adaptation strategies, demonstrating that efficient low-rank adaptation when paired with few-shot tuning, improves robustness while preserving generalization across modalities.

  Machine learning and computer vision methods have a major impact on the study of natural animal behavior, as they enable the (semi-)automatic analysis of vast amounts of video data. Mice are the standard mammalian model system in most research fields, but the datasets available today to refine such methods focus either on simple or social behaviors. In this work, we present a video dataset of individual mice solving complex mechanical puzzles, so-called lockboxes. The more than 110 hours of total playtime show their behavior recorded from three different perspectives. As a benchmark for frame-level action classification methods, we provide human-annotated labels for all videos of two different mice, that equal 13% of our dataset. Our keypoint (pose) tracking-based action classification framework illustrates the challenges of automated labeling of fine-grained behaviors, such as the manipulation of objects. We hope that our work will help accelerate the advancement of automated action and behavior classification in the computational neuroscience community.

  _Huilin Zhu, Senyao Li, Jingling Yuan, Zhengwei Yang, Yu Guo, Wenxuan Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expanding pre-trained zero-shot counting models to handle unseen categories requires more than simply adding new prompts, as this approach does not achieve the necessary alignment between text and visual features for accurate counting. We introduce RichCount, the first framework to address these limitations, employing a two-stage training strategy that enhances text encoding and strengthens the model's association with objects in images. RichCount improves zero-shot counting for unseen categories through two key objectives: (1) enriching text features with a feed-forward network and adapter trained on text-image similarity, thereby creating robust, aligned representations; and (2) applying this refined encoder to counting tasks, enabling effective generalization across diverse prompts and complex images. In this manner, RichCount goes beyond simple prompt expansion to establish meaningful feature alignment that supports accurate counting across novel categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RichCount, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot counting and significantly enhancing generalization to unseen categories in open-world scenarios.

  _Raphael Sulzer, Liuyun Duan, Nicolas Girard, Florent Lafarge_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the P$^3$ dataset, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for building vectorization, constructed from aerial LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution aerial imagery, and vectorized 2D building outlines, collected across three continents. The dataset contains over 10 billion LiDAR points with decimeter-level accuracy and RGB images at a ground sampling distance of 25 centimeter. While many existing datasets primarily focus on the image modality, P$^3$ offers a complementary perspective by also incorporating dense 3D information. We demonstrate that LiDAR point clouds serve as a robust modality for predicting building polygons, both in hybrid and end-to-end learning frameworks. Moreover, fusing aerial LiDAR and imagery further improves accuracy and geometric quality of predicted polygons. The P$^3$ dataset is publicly available, along with code and pretrained weights of three state-of-the-art models for building polygon prediction atthis https URL.

  Leveraging the power of multimodal large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of morphing attack detection (MAD), especially in real-world biometric applications. This work introduces the use of LLMs for differential morphing attack detection (D-MAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to employ multimodal LLMs to D-MAD using real biometric data. To effectively utilize these models, we design Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based prompts to reduce failure-to-answer rates and enhance the reasoning behind decisions. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of multimodal LLMs for D-MAD using real data subjects, (2) CoT-based prompt engineering to improve response reliability and explainability, (3) comprehensive qualitative and quantitative benchmarking of LLM performance using data from 54 individuals captured in passport enrollment scenarios, and (4) comparative analysis of two multimodal LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and Gemini providing insights into their morphing attack detection accuracy and decision transparency. Experimental results show that ChatGPT-4o outperforms Gemini in detection accuracy, especially against GAN-based morphs, though both models struggle under challenging conditions. While Gemini offers more consistent explanations, ChatGPT-4o is more resilient but prone to a higher failure-to-answer rate.

  _Yuchen Li, Chaoran Feng, Zhenyu Tang, Kaiyuan Deng, Wangbo Yu, Yonghong Tian, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GS2E (Gaussian Splatting to Event), a large-scale synthetic event dataset for high-fidelity event vision tasks, captured from real-world sparse multi-view RGB images. Existing event datasets are often synthesized from dense RGB videos, which typically lack viewpoint diversity and geometric consistency, or depend on expensive, difficult-to-scale hardware setups. GS2E overcomes these limitations by first reconstructing photorealistic static scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, and subsequently employing a novel, physically-informed event simulation pipeline. This pipeline generally integrates adaptive trajectory interpolation with physically-consistent event contrast threshold modeling. Such an approach yields temporally dense and geometrically consistent event streams under diverse motion and lighting conditions, while ensuring strong alignment with underlying scene structures. Experimental results on event-based 3D reconstruction demonstrate GS2E's superior generalization capabilities and its practical value as a benchmark for advancing event vision research.

  _Eduarda Caldeira, Jan Niklas Kolf, Naser Damer, Fadi Boutros_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face recognition models have made substantial progress due to advances in deep learning and the availability of large-scale datasets. However, reliance on massive annotated datasets introduces challenges related to training computational cost and data storage, as well as potential privacy concerns regarding managing large face datasets. This paper presents DiffProb, the first data pruning approach for the application of face recognition. DiffProb assesses the prediction probabilities of training samples within each identity and prunes the ones with identical or close prediction probability values, as they are likely reinforcing the same decision boundaries, and thus contribute minimally with new information. We further enhance this process with an auxiliary cleaning mechanism to eliminate mislabeled and label-flipped samples, boosting data quality with minimal loss. Extensive experiments on CASIA-WebFace with different pruning ratios and multiple benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP, and IJB-C, demonstrate that DiffProb can prune up to 50% of the dataset while maintaining or even, in some settings, improving the verification accuracies. Additionally, we demonstrate DiffProb's robustness across different architectures and loss functions. Our method significantly reduces training cost and data volume, enabling efficient face recognition training and reducing the reliance on massive datasets and their demanding management.

  _Kim Yun, Hana Satou, F Monkey_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite progress in geometry-aware domain adaptation, current methods such as GAMA still suffer from two unresolved issues: (1) insufficient disentanglement of task-relevant and task-irrelevant manifold dimensions, and (2) rigid perturbation schemes that ignore per-class alignment asymmetries. To address this, we propose GAMA++, a novel framework that introduces (i) latent space disentanglement to isolate label-consistent manifold directions from nuisance factors, and (ii) an adaptive contrastive perturbation strategy that tailors both on- and off-manifold exploration to class-specific manifold curvature and alignment discrepancy. We further propose a cross-domain contrastive consistency loss that encourages local semantic clusters to align while preserving intra-domain diversity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on DomainNet, Office-Home, and VisDA benchmarks under both standard and few-shot settings, with notable improvements in class-level alignment fidelity and boundary robustness. GAMA++ sets a new standard for semantic geometry alignment in transfer learning.

  _Yuxuan Du, Zhendong Wang, Yuhao Luo, Caiyong Piao, Zhiyuan Yan, Hao Li, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid emergence of multimodal deepfakes (visual and auditory content are manipulated in concert) undermines the reliability of existing detectors that rely solely on modality-specific artifacts or cross-modal inconsistencies. In this work, we first demonstrate that modality-specific forensic traces (e.g., face-swap artifacts or spectral distortions) and modality-shared semantic misalignments (e.g., lip-speech asynchrony) offer complementary evidence, and that neglecting either aspect limits detection performance. Existing approaches either naively fuse modality-specific features without reconciling their conflicting characteristics or focus predominantly on semantic misalignment at the expense of modality-specific fine-grained artifact cues. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general multimodal framework for video deepfake detection via Cross-Modal Alignment and Distillation (CAD). CAD comprises two core components: 1) Cross-modal alignment that identifies inconsistencies in high-level semantic synchronization (e.g., lip-speech mismatches); 2) Cross-modal distillation that mitigates feature conflicts during fusion while preserving modality-specific forensic traces (e.g., spectral distortions in synthetic audio). Extensive experiments on both multimodal and unimodal (e.g., image-only/video-only)deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CAD significantly outperforms previous methods, validating the necessity of harmonious integration of multimodal complementary information.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition.

  _Yangting Shi, Renjie He, Le Hui, Xiang Li, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems, varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target Detector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines the IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training text-to-image (T2I) models with detailed captions can significantly improve their generation quality. Existing methods often rely on simplistic metrics like caption length to represent the detailness of the caption in the T2I training set. In this paper, we propose a new metric to estimate caption detailness based on two aspects: image coverage rate (ICR), which evaluates whether the caption covers all regions/objects in the image, and average object detailness (AOD), which quantifies the detailness of each object's description. Through experiments on the COCO dataset using ShareGPT4V captions, we demonstrate that T2I models trained on high-ICR and -AOD captions achieve superior performance on DPG and other benchmarks. Notably, our metric enables more effective data selection-training on only 20% of full data surpasses both full-dataset training and length-based selection method, improving alignment and reconstruction ability. These findings highlight the critical role of detail-aware metrics over length-based heuristics in caption selection for T2I tasks.

  Cinematography is a cornerstone of film production and appreciation, shaping mood, emotion, and narrative through visual elements such as camera movement, shot composition, and lighting. Despite recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video generation models, the capacity of current models to grasp and reproduce cinematographic techniques remains largely uncharted, hindered by the scarcity of expert-annotated data. To bridge this gap, we present CineTechBench, a pioneering benchmark founded on precise, manual annotation by seasoned cinematography experts across key cinematography dimensions. Our benchmark covers seven essential aspects-shot scale, shot angle, composition, camera movement, lighting, color, and focal length-and includes over 600 annotated movie images and 120 movie clips with clear cinematographic techniques. For the understanding task, we design question answer pairs and annotated descriptions to assess MLLMs' ability to interpret and explain cinematographic techniques. For the generation task, we assess advanced video generation models on their capacity to reconstruct cinema-quality camera movements given conditions such as textual prompts or keyframes. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on 15+ MLLMs and 5+ video generation models. Our results offer insights into the limitations of current models and future directions for cinematography understanding and generation in automatically film production and appreciation.

  Multispectral object detection aims to leverage complementary information from visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities to enable robust performance under diverse environmental conditions. In this letter, we propose IC-Fusion, a multispectral object detector that effectively fuses visible and infrared features through a lightweight and modalityaware design. Motivated by wavelet analysis and empirical observations, we find that IR images contain structurally rich high-frequency information critical for object localization, while RGB images provide complementary semantic context. To exploit this, we adopt a compact RGB backbone and design a novel fusion module comprising a Multi-Scale Feature Distillation (MSFD) block to enhance RGB features and a three-stage fusion block with Cross-Modal Channel Shuffle Gate (CCSG) and Cross-Modal Large Kernel Gate (CLKG) to facilitate effective cross-modal interaction. Experiments on the FLIR and LLVIP benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our IR-centric fusion strategy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales. These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like multi-modal understanding.

  Large vision-language models exhibit inherent capabilities to handle diverse visual perception tasks. In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks within a shared model. Specifically, by designing novel multi-object cognitive learning strategies and systematic task reformulation, VisionReasoner enhances its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse perception tasks in a unified framework. The model generates a structured reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user queries. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains: detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1% on COCO (detection), 22.1% on ReasonSeg (segmentation), and 15.3% on CountBench (counting).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However, existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs, requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods, revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations, while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy (TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2 - 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the number of steps.

  This work introduces RGBX-DiffusionDet, an object detection framework extending the DiffusionDet model to fuse the heterogeneous 2D data (X) with RGB imagery via an adaptive multimodal encoder. To enable cross-modal interaction, we design the dynamic channel reduction within a convolutional block attention module (DCR-CBAM), which facilitates cross-talk between subnetworks by dynamically highlighting salient channel features. Furthermore, the dynamic multi-level aggregation block (DMLAB) is proposed to refine spatial feature representations through adaptive multiscale fusion. Finally, novel regularization losses that enforce channel saliency and spatial selectivity are introduced, leading to compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments using RGB-Depth (KITTI), a novel annotated RGB-Polarimetric dataset, and RGB-Infrared (M$^3$FD) benchmark dataset were conducted. We demonstrate consistent superiority of the proposed approach over the baseline RGB-only DiffusionDet. The modular architecture maintains the original decoding complexity, ensuring efficiency. These results establish the proposed RGBX-DiffusionDet as a flexible multimodal object detection approach, providing new insights into integrating diverse 2D sensing modalities into diffusion-based detection pipelines.

  Medical Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in medical data interpretation. However, these models frequently generate hallucinations contradicting source evidence, particularly due to inadequate localization reasoning. This work reveals a critical limitation in current medical LMMs: instead of analyzing relevant pathological regions, they often rely on linguistic patterns or attend to irrelevant image areas when responding to disease-related queries. To address this, we introduce HEAL-MedVQA (Hallucination Evaluation via Localization MedVQA), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs' localization abilities and hallucination robustness. HEAL-MedVQA features (i) two innovative evaluation protocols to assess visual and textual shortcut learning, and (ii) a dataset of 67K VQA pairs, with doctor-annotated anatomical segmentation masks for pathological regions. To improve visual reasoning, we propose the Localize-before-Answer (LobA) framework, which trains LMMs to localize target regions of interest and self-prompt to emphasize segmented pathological areas, generating grounded and reliable answers. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art biomedical LMMs on the challenging HEAL-MedVQA benchmark, advancing robustness in medical VQA.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video-language models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding video content but struggle with spatial relationships, temporal ordering, and cross-frame continuity. To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct Preference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic and significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to 3.8% on LongVideoBench, 4.1% on VideoMME, and 4.0% on MVBench, when applied to various state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without any human annotation or captioning, relying solely on 32-frame sampling. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their original capabilities.

  Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents is a promising research direction, which simulates human interaction with computers or mobile phones to perform diverse GUI tasks. However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.

  Video spatial reasoning, which involves inferring the underlying spatial structure from observed video frames, poses a significant challenge for existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This limitation stems primarily from 1) the absence of high-quality datasets for this task, and 2) the lack of effective training strategies to develop spatial reasoning capabilities. Motivated by the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) in unlocking LLM reasoning abilities, this work aims to improve MLLMs in video spatial reasoning through the RLVR paradigm. To this end, we introduce the $\textbf{SpaceR}$ framework. First, we present $\textbf{SpaceR-151k}$, a dataset with 91k questions spanning diverse spatial reasoning scenarios with verifiable answers, and 60k samples for maintaining general multimodal understanding. Second, we propose $\textbf{Spatially-Guided RLVR (SG-RLVR)}$, a novel reinforcement learning approach that extends Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel map imagination mechanism, which encourages the model to infer spatial layouts in the thinking process, thereby facilitating more effective spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceR achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench, STI-Bench, and SPAR-Bench), while maintaining competitive results on video understanding benchmarks (e.g., Video-MME, TempCompass, and LongVideoBench). Remarkably, SpaceR surpasses the advanced GPT-4o by 11.6\% accuracy on VSI-Bench and is on par with the leading proprietary model Gemini-2.0-Flash, highlighting the effectiveness of our SpaceR-151k dataset and SG-RLVR in reinforcing spatial reasoning ability of MLLMs. Code, model, and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated significant successes in various computer vision tasks, such as classification and segmentation. However, its application to optical flow estimation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MambaFlow, a novel framework designed to leverage the high accuracy and efficiency of the Mamba architecture for capturing locally correlated features while preserving global information in end-to-end optical flow estimation. To our knowledge, MambaFlow is the first architecture centered around the Mamba design tailored specifically for optical flow estimation. It comprises two key components: (1) PolyMamba, which optimizes feature representation; and (2) PulseMamba, which facilitates efficient flow information dissemination. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaFlow achieves remarkable results. On the Sintel benchmark, MambaFlow records an endpoint error (EPE) of 1.43 and an inference speed of 0.113 seconds, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods including GMFlow (with 18.9% lower EPE and 18.1% faster inference), SeparableFlow (5% lower EPE and 50.5% faster), CRAFT (1.11% lower EPE and 76.5% faster), and DIP (0.7% lower EPE and 77.2% faster)-demonstrating stronger potential for real-world deployment on resource-constrained devices.

  Recent text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable results by training on billion-scale datasets, following a `bigger is better' paradigm that prioritizes data quantity over availability (closed vs open source) and reproducibility (data decay vs established collections). We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that one can match or outperform models trained on massive web-scraped collections, using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations. With this much simpler setup, we achieve a +1% overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +0.5% on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. This opens the way for more reproducible research as ImageNet is a widely available dataset and our standardized training setup does not require massive compute resources.

  We present "Humans and Structure from Motion" (HSfM), a method for jointly reconstructing multiple human meshes, scene point clouds, and camera parameters in a metric world coordinate system from a sparse set of uncalibrated multi-view images featuring people. Our approach combines data-driven scene reconstruction with the traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) framework to achieve more accurate scene reconstruction and camera estimation, while simultaneously recovering human meshes. In contrast to existing scene reconstruction and SfM methods that lack metric scale information, our method estimates approximate metric scale by leveraging a human statistical model. Furthermore, it reconstructs multiple human meshes within the same world coordinate system alongside the scene point cloud, effectively capturing spatial relationships among individuals and their positions in the environment. We initialize the reconstruction of humans, scenes, and cameras using robust foundational models and jointly optimize these elements. This joint optimization synergistically improves the accuracy of each component. We compare our method to existing approaches on two challenging benchmarks, EgoHumans and EgoExo4D, demonstrating significant improvements in human localization accuracy within the world coordinate frame (reducing error from 3.51m to 1.04m in EgoHumans and from 2.9m to 0.56m in EgoExo4D). Notably, our results show that incorporating human data into the SfM pipeline improves camera pose estimation (e.g., increasing RRA@15 by 20.3% on EgoHumans). Additionally, qualitative results show that our approach improves overall scene reconstruction quality. Our code is available at:this https URL

  General Text-to-3D (GT23D) generation is crucial for creating diverse 3D content across objects and scenes, yet it faces two key challenges: 1) ensuring semantic consistency between input text and generated 3D models, and 2) maintaining multi-view consistency across different perspectives within 3D. Existing approaches typically address only one of these challenges, often leading to suboptimal results in semantic fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose SeMv-3D, a novel framework that jointly enhances semantic alignment and multi-view consistency in GT23D generation. At its core, we introduce Triplane Prior Learning (TPL), which effectively learns triplane priors by capturing spatial correspondences across three orthogonal planes using a dedicated Orthogonal Attention mechanism, thereby ensuring geometric consistency across viewpoints. Additionally, we present Prior-based Semantic Aligning in Triplanes (SAT), which enables consistent any-view synthesis by leveraging attention-based feature alignment to reinforce the correspondence between textual semantics and triplane representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art in multi-view consistency, while maintaining competitive performance in semantic consistency compared to methods focused solely on semantic alignment. These results emphasize the remarkable ability of our approach to effectively balance and excel in both dimensions, establishing a new benchmark in the field.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have tremendous potential to improve the accuracy, availability, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare by providing automated solutions or serving as aids to medical professionals. Despite promising first steps in developing medical MLLMs in the past few years, their capabilities and limitations are not well-understood. Recently, many benchmark datasets have been proposed that test the general medical knowledge of such models across a variety of medical areas. However, the systematic failure modes and vulnerabilities of such models are severely underexplored with most medical benchmarks failing to expose the shortcomings of existing models in this safety-critical domain. In this paper, we introduce MediConfusion, a challenging medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark dataset, that probes the failure modes of medical MLLMs from a vision perspective. We reveal that state-of-the-art models are easily confused by image pairs that are otherwise visually dissimilar and clearly distinct for medical experts. Strikingly, all available models (open-source or proprietary) achieve performance below random guessing on MediConfusion, raising serious concerns about the reliability of existing medical MLLMs for healthcare deployment. We also extract common patterns of model failure that may help the design of a new generation of more trustworthy and reliable MLLMs in healthcare.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive procedure initially developed for early gastric cancer treatment and has expanded to address diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted surgery (CAS) systems enhance ESD precision and safety, their efficacy hinges on accurate real-time surgical phase recognition, a task complicated by ESD's inherent complexity, including heterogeneous lesion characteristics and dynamic tissue interactions. Existing video-based phase recognition algorithms, constrained by inefficient temporal context modeling, exhibit limited performance in capturing fine-grained phase transitions and long-range dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPRMamba, a novel framework integrating a Mamba-based architecture with a Scaled Residual TranMamba (SRTM) block to synergize long-term temporal modeling and localized detail extraction. SPRMamba further introduces the Hierarchical Sampling Strategy to optimize computational efficiency, enabling real-time processing critical for clinical deployment. Evaluated on the ESD385 dataset and the cholecystectomy benchmark Cholec80, SPRMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance (87.64% accuracy on ESD385, +1.0% over prior methods), demonstrating robust generalizability across surgical workflows. This advancement bridges the gap between computational efficiency and temporal sensitivity, offering a transformative tool for intraoperative guidance and skill assessment in ESD surgery.

  _Huanxuan Liao, Wen Hu, Yao Xu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or encode context into latent representations for soft global compression. However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover, HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token consumption by 88.8\%.

Finally, we introduce Tiny-Cloze Benchmark - a new synthetic benchmark for natural language understanding that is more informative for less powerful models. We use Tiny-Cloze Benchmark to evaluate fine-tuned models in several domains demonstrating that fine-tuning on a new synthetic language allows for better performance on a variety of tasks.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses, overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR), a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon publication.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS] representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens. Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii) combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better performance on the standard BERT-base model.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discovering customer intentions in dialogue conversations is crucial for automated service agents. However, existing intent clustering methods often fail to align with human perceptions due to a heavy reliance on embedding distance metrics and a tendency to overlook underlying semantic structures. This paper proposes an LLM-in-the-loop (LLM-ITL) intent clustering framework, integrating the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs into conventional clustering algorithms. Specifically, this paper (1) investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs in semantic coherence evaluation and intent cluster naming, achieving over 95% accuracy aligned with human judgments; (2) designs an LLM-ITL framework that facilitates the iterative discovery of coherent intent clusters and the optimal number of clusters; and (3) proposes context-aware techniques tailored for customer service dialogue. As existing English benchmarks offer limited semantic diversity and intent groups, we introduce a comprehensive Chinese dialogue intent dataset, comprising over 100k real customer service calls and 1,507 human-annotated intent clusters. The proposed approaches significantly outperform LLM-guided baselines, achieving notable enhancements in clustering quality and lower computational cost. Combined with several best practices, our findings highlight the potential of LLM-in-the-loop techniques for scalable and human-aligned intent clustering.

  Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel, fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible. Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

  Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack, with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%, providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation.

  Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical, highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

  Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks. However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design. SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and adaptive MAS.

  Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over 128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess their reasoning capabilities. Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation, we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive, multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited to complex, interactive environments.

Moreover, we further demonstrate our method to fuzzy tasks where ground truth is unavailable. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy while generating significantly more concise explanations, effectively teaching models to "think when needed."

  Language model evaluations often fail to characterize consequential failure modes, forcing experts to inspect outputs and build new benchmarks. We introduce task elicitation, a method that automatically builds new evaluations to profile model behavior. Task elicitation finds hundreds of natural-language tasks -- an order of magnitude more than prior work -- where frontier models exhibit systematic failures, in domains ranging from forecasting to online harassment. For example, we find that Sonnet 3.5 over-associates quantum computing and AGI and that o3-mini is prone to hallucination when fabrications are repeated in-context.

  As the demand for high-quality data in model training grows, researchers and developers are increasingly generating synthetic data to tune and train LLMs. However, current data generation methods rely on seed sets containing tens of thousands of examples to prompt instruction-tuned models. This reliance can be especially problematic when the curation of high-quality examples is expensive or difficult. In this paper we explore the novel few-shot synthetic data generation setting -- generating a high-quality dataset from a few examples. We show that when working with only a few seed examples, instruction-tuned models used in current synthetic data methods produce insufficient diversity for downstream tasks. In contrast, we show that base models without post-training, largely untapped for synthetic data generation, offer substantially greater output diversity, albeit with lower instruction following abilities. Leveraging this insight, we propose Base-Refine (BARE), a novel two-stage method that combines the diversity of base models with the quality assurance of instruction-tuned models. BARE excels in few-shot synthetic data generation: using only 3 seed examples it generates diverse, high-quality datasets that significantly improve downstream task performance. We show that fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with 1,000 BARE-generated samples achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art similarly sized models on LiveCodeBench tasks. Furthermore, data generated with BARE enables a 101% improvement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B on GSM8K over data generated by only instruction-models, and an 18.4% improvement for a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B over the state-of-the-art RAFT method for RAG data generation.

  The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

  Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

  Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence, each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

  Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability, frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by (II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings. Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66% of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around 4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly, UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by 35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current unlearing domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

  While large language models (LLMs) show great potential in temporal reasoning, most existing work focuses heavily on enhancing performance, often neglecting the explainable reasoning processes underlying the results. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally, LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region. Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA) achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of English.

  Robustly evaluating the long-form storytelling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, as existing benchmarks often lack the necessary scale, diversity, or objective measures. To address this, we introduce WebNovelBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating long-form novel generation. WebNovelBench leverages a large-scale dataset of over 4,000 Chinese web novels, framing evaluation as a synopsis-to-story generation task. We propose a multi-faceted framework encompassing eight narrative quality dimensions, assessed automatically via an LLM-as-Judge approach. Scores are aggregated using Principal Component Analysis and mapped to a percentile rank against human-authored works. Our experiments demonstrate that WebNovelBench effectively differentiates between human-written masterpieces, popular web novels, and LLM-generated content. We provide a comprehensive analysis of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, ranking their storytelling abilities and offering insights for future development. This benchmark provides a scalable, replicable, and data-driven methodology for assessing and advancing LLM-driven narrative generation.

  Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability, as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases. Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and data atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on mathematical tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to +5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%) and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%), functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.

  Video Comment Art enhances user engagement by providing creative content that conveys humor, satire, or emotional resonance, requiring a nuanced and comprehensive grasp of cultural and contextual subtleties. Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in STEM tasks (e.g. mathematics and coding), they still struggle to generate creative expressions such as resonant jokes and insightful satire. Moreover, existing benchmarks are constrained by their limited modalities and insufficient categories, hindering the exploration of comprehensive creativity in video-based Comment Art creation. To address these limitations, we introduce GODBench, a novel benchmark that integrates video and text modalities to systematically evaluate MLLMs' abilities to compose Comment Art. Furthermore, inspired by the propagation patterns of waves in physics, we propose Ripple of Thought (RoT), a multi-step reasoning framework designed to enhance the creativity of MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal that existing MLLMs and CoT methods still face significant challenges in understanding and generating creative video comments. In contrast, RoT provides an effective approach to improve creative composing, highlighting its potential to drive meaningful advancements in MLLM-based creativity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High computation costs and latency of large language models such as GPT-4 have limited their deployment in clinical settings. Small language models (SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of 3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline, MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5% on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by 14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization achieves further gains of 18.9% on average.

  This paper investigates an underexplored challenge in large language models (LLMs): the impact of KV cache compression methods on LLMs' fundamental capabilities. Although existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on long-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain understudied. We present a comprehensive benchmark KVFundaBench to systematically evaluate the effects of KV cache compression across diverse fundamental LLM capabilities, spanning world knowledge, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and long-context understanding andthis http URLanalysis reveals serval key findings: (1) \textit{Task-Dependent Degradation}; (2) \textit{Model-Type Robustness} (3) \textit{Prompt Length Vulnerability}; (4) \textit{Chunk-Level Superiority}; (5) \textit{Prompt-Gain Sensitivity}; (6) \textit{Long-Context Generation Sensitivity}. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task compression performance, we propose ShotKV, a novel compression approach that distinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level semantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves $9\%$-$18\%$ performance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive compression ratios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering. Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks, highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process. Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2) dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference, largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner from current DLMs.

  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, often overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance and lacking benchmarks with vocal-specific test instances. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speech interaction models' capabilities in vocal communication. VocalBench comprises 9,400 carefully curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future research in speech-based interaction systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness, professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this benchmark.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS, a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention, FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method, Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks sequentially, is crucial for language models (LMs). Recently, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs. However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to contribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation (GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches. Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the contribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has advanced natural language processing, yet concerns about cognitive biases are growing. In this paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments. We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms, and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

  Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000 languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services. Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*), undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g., "*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers, while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

  Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve 10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) embed private or copyrighted information not only in their final answers but also throughout multi-step chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, making reliable unlearning far more demanding than in standard LLMs. We introduce Reasoning-TOFU (R-TOFU), the first benchmark tailored to this setting. R-TOFU augments existing unlearning tasks with realistic CoT annotations and provides step-wise metrics that expose residual knowledge invisible to answer-level checks. Using R-TOFU, we carry out a comprehensive comparison of gradient-based and preference-optimization baselines and show that conventional answer-only objectives leave substantial forget traces in reasoning. We further propose Reasoned IDK, a preference-optimization variant that preserves coherent yet inconclusive reasoning, achieving a stronger balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility than earlier refusal styles. Finally, we identify a failure mode: decoding variants such as ZeroThink and LessThink can still reveal forgotten content despite seemingly successful unlearning, emphasizing the need to evaluate models under diverse decoding settings. Together, the benchmark, analysis, and new baseline establish a systematic foundation for studying and improving unlearning in LRMs while preserving their reasoning capabilities.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint, overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event, such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia. Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap. DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for real-world applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks. We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229 scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark. Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase intentions improves their performance.

  The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning. However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal, allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations. Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies: Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection, Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.

  The massive user-generated content (UGC) available in Chinese social media is giving rise to the possibility of studying internet buzzwords. In this paper, we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while revealing crucial shared challenges: over-reliance on prior exposure, underdeveloped inferential abilities, and difficulty identifying high-quality UGC to facilitate comprehension. We believe our work lays the groundwork for future advancements in LLM-based definition generation. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu. Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck, particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models. UrduFactCheck's code and datasets are open-sourced and publicly available atthis https URL.

  The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread, yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark effectiveness, examining main-stream prominent LLM benchmarks using results from diverse models. We first propose a new framework for accurate and reliable estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Specifically, we propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters within an IRT-grounded architecture. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive analysis which reveals significant and varied shortcomings in the measurement quality of current benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger alignment with human preference.

  Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval. However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval, 2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However, their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models (ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon. As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific "expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284 multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness, norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate 21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models. Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors. These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents, and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases. MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent, exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model and toolchain upgrades.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation. In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making mixed-query evaluation crucial.We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios, leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective. Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain queries in a single prompt.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero, enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include: (1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics, chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these 12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC) demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

  As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

  In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure layouts, and functional zoning, require specialized understanding of spatial configurations, regulatory requirements, and multi-scale analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B parameter model achieves comparable performance to models exceeding 72B parameters, demonstrating efficient domain specialization without sacrificing performance.

  Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging due to their massive scale and associated computational costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methodologies have been proposed as computational alternatives; however, their implementations still require significant resources. In this paper, we present OSoRA (Output-Dimension and Singular-Value Initialized Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method for LLMs. OSoRA extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by integrating Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with learnable scaling vectors in a unified framework. It first performs an SVD of pre-trained weight matrices, then optimizes an output-dimension vector during training, while keeping the corresponding singular vector matrices frozen. OSoRA substantially reduces computational resource requirements by minimizing the number of trainable parameters during fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, common sense reasoning, and other benchmarks demonstrate that OSoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA and VeRA, while maintaining a linear parameter scaling even as the rank increases to higher dimensions. Our ablation studies further confirm that jointly training both the singular values and the output-dimension vector is critical for optimal performance.

To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, the long thought process in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a potential approach to address safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data distilled from large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek R1) can effectively transfer reasoning capabilities to non-reasoning models. However, models fine-tuned with this approach inherit the "overthinking" problem from teacher models, producing verbose and redundant reasoning chains during inference. To address this challenge, we propose Long-Short Chain-of-Thought Mixture Supervised Fine-Tuning (LS-Mixture SFT), which combines long CoT reasoning dataset with their short counterparts obtained through structure-preserved rewriting. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using the LS-Mixture SFT method, compared to those trained with direct SFT, achieved an average accuracy improvement of 2.3% across various benchmarks while substantially reducing model response length by approximately 47.61%. This work offers an approach to endow non-reasoning models with reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning while avoiding the inherent overthinking problems inherited from teacher models, thereby enabling efficient reasoning in the fine-tuned models.

  The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.

  The improvement of LLMs' instruction-following capabilities depends critically on the availability of high-quality instruction-response pairs. While existing automatic data synthetic methods alleviate the burden of manual curation, they often rely heavily on either the quality of seed data or strong assumptions about the structure and content of web documents. To tackle these challenges, we propose Web Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework for synthesizing high-quality instruction-tuning (IT) data directly from raw web documents with minimal assumptions. Leveraging the inherent diversity of raw web content, we conceptualize web reconstruction as an instruction-tuning data synthesis task via a novel dual-perspective paradigm--Web as Instruction and Web as Response--where each web document is designated as either an instruction or a response to trigger the reconstruction process. Comprehensive experiments show that datasets generated by WebR outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.65% across four instruction-following benchmarks. Notably, WebR demonstrates superior compatibility, data efficiency, and scalability, enabling enhanced domain adaptation with minimal effort. The data and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks by leveraging increased test-time computation and exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of human-like self-reflection. While LRMs show a clear capacity for valuable self-reflection, how this ability interacts with other model behaviors remains underexplored. We investigate this connection by analyzing verbalized confidence, how models articulate their certainty, as a lens into the nature of self-reflection in LRMs. We find that supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces (i.e., distillation) and reinforcement learning can improve verbalized calibration in reasoning-intensive settings in a progressive, laddered fashion. However, our results also indicate that reasoning models may possess a diminished awareness of their own knowledge boundaries, as evidenced by significantly lower "I don't know" response rates on factuality benchmarks. Moreover, we examine the relationship between verbalized confidence and reasoning chains, finding that models tend to express higher confidence when providing shorter or less elaborate reasoning. Our findings highlight how reasoning-oriented training can enhance performance in reasoning-centric tasks while potentially incurring a "reasoning tax," a cost reflected in the model's reduced ability to accurately recognize the limits of its own knowledge in small-scale models. More broadly, our work showcases how this erosion of knowledge boundaries can compromise model faithfulness, as models grow more confident without a commensurate understanding of when they should abstain.

  Recent text-to-SQL systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in translating natural language queries into SQL. However, these systems often struggle with complex database structures and domain-specific queries, as they primarily focus on enhancing logical reasoning and SQL syntax while overlooking the critical need for comprehensive database understanding. To address this limitation, we propose DB-Explore, a novel framework that systematically aligns LLMs with database knowledge through automated exploration and instruction synthesis. DB-Explore constructs database graphs to capture complex relational schemas, leverages GPT-4 to systematically mine structural patterns and semantic knowledge, and synthesizes instructions to distill this knowledge for efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. Our framework enables comprehensive database understanding through diverse sampling strategies and automated instruction generation, bridging the gap between database structures and language models. Experiments conducted on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks validate the effectiveness of DB-Explore, achieving an execution accuracy of 67.0% on BIRD and 87.8% on SPIDER. Notably, our open-source implementation based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B achieves state-of-the-art results at minimal computational cost, outperforming several GPT-4-driven Text-to-SQL systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have signif- icantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and reason- ing. Recently, their potential for automating precise text editing tasks across specialized do- mains, such as programming code, LaTeX, and structured database languages, has gained atten- tion. However, current state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle with executing precise, instruction- driven edits, particularly when structural ac- curacy and strict adherence to domain con- ventions are required. To address these chal- lenges, we introduce InstrEditBench, an au- tomated benchmark dataset comprising over 30,000 structured editing tasks spanning di- verse domains, including Wikipedia articles, LaTeX documents, source code, and database languages. Using this benchmark, we develop FineEdit, a specialized editing model explicitly trained for accurate, context-aware text mod- ifications. Experimental evaluations demon- strate that FineEdit outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving improvements of approxi- mately 10% over Gemini models on single-turn edits, up to 30% over Llama-3.2-3B, and ex- ceeding Mistral-7B-OpenOrca performance by over 40% on direct editing tasks. FineEdit also effectively generalizes to realistic multi-turn editing scenarios, highlighting its practical ap- plicability.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linguistic evaluations of how well LMs generalize to produce or understand novel text often implicitly take for granted that natural languages are generated by symbolic rules. Grammaticality is thought to be determined by whether sentences obey such rules. Interpretation is believed to be compositionally generated by syntactic rules operating on meaningful words. Semantic parsing is intended to map sentences into formal logic. Failures of LMs to obey strict rules have been taken to reveal that LMs do not produce or understand language like humans. Here we suggest that LMs' failures to obey symbolic rules may be a feature rather than a bug, because natural languages are not based on rules. New utterances are produced and understood by a combination of flexible, interrelated, and context-dependent constructions. We encourage researchers to reimagine appropriate benchmarks and analyses that acknowledge the rich, flexible generalizations that comprise natural languages.

  Deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications requires robust safety guard models to detect and block harmful user prompts. While large safety guard models achieve strong performance, their computational cost is substantial. To mitigate this, smaller distilled models are used, but they often underperform on "hard" examples where the larger model provides accurate predictions. We observe that many inputs can be reliably handled by the smaller model, while only a small fraction require the larger model's capacity. Motivated by this, we propose SafeRoute, a binary router that distinguishes hard examples from easy ones. Our method selectively applies the larger safety guard model to the data that the router considers hard, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy compared to solely using the larger safety guard model. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our adaptive model selection significantly enhances the trade-off between computational cost and safety performance, outperforming relevant baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a major security concern as it can deceive LLMs to generate harmful text. Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\% impact on the model's general capabilities.

  Understanding temporal relations and answering time-sensitive questions is crucial yet a challenging task for question-answering systems powered by large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches either update the parametric knowledge of LLMs with new facts, which is resource-intensive and often impractical, or integrate LLMs with external knowledge retrieval (i.e., retrieval-augmented generation). However, off-the-shelf retrievers often struggle to identify relevant documents that require intensive temporal reasoning. To systematically study time-sensitive question answering, we introduce the TempRAGEval benchmark, which repurposes existing datasets by incorporating temporal perturbations and gold evidence labels. As anticipated, all existing retrieval methods struggle with these temporal reasoning-intensive questions. We further propose Modular Retrieval (MRAG), a trainless framework that includes three modules: (1) Question Processing that decomposes question into a main content and a temporal constraint; (2) Retrieval and Summarization that retrieves evidence and uses LLMs to summarize according to the main content; (3) Semantic-Temporal Hybrid Ranking that scores each evidence summarization based on both semantic and temporal relevance. On TempRAGEval, MRAG significantly outperforms baseline retrievers in retrieval performance, leading to further improvements in final answer accuracy.

  Speculative Decoding has gained popularity as an effective technique for accelerating the auto-regressive inference process of Large Language Models. However, Speculative Decoding entirely relies on the availability of efficient draft models, which are often lacking for many existing language models due to a stringent constraint of vocabulary compatibility. In this work we introduce FastDraft, a novel and efficient approach for pre-training and aligning a draft model to any large language model by incorporating efficient pre-training, followed by fine-tuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model. We demonstrate FastDraft by training two highly parameter efficient drafts for the popular Phi-3-mini and Llama-3.1-8B models. Using FastDraft, we were able to produce a draft model with approximately 10 billion tokens on a single server with 8 Intel$^\circledR$ Gaudi$^\circledR$ 2 accelerators in under 24 hours. Our results show that the draft model achieves impressive results in key metrics of acceptance rate, block efficiency and up to 3x memory bound speed up when evaluated on code completion and up to 2x in summarization, text completion and instruction tasks. We validate our theoretical findings through benchmarking on the latest Intel$^\circledR$ Core$^{\tiny \text{TM}}$ Ultra, achieving a wall-clock time speedup of up to 2x, indicating a significant reduction in runtime. Due to its high quality, FastDraft unlocks large language models inference on AI-PC and other edge-devices.

  To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as conscious agents with generalizable reasoning capabilities, it is crucial that they possess the reasoning ability to comprehend situational changes (transitions) in distribution triggered by environmental factors or actions from other agents. Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with situational transitions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a novel formulation of reasoning with distributional changes as a three-step discriminative process, termed as MetAphysical ReaSoning. We then introduce the first-ever benchmark, MARS, comprising three tasks corresponding to each step. These tasks systematically assess LLMs' capabilities in reasoning the plausibility of (i) changes in actions, (ii) states caused by changed actions, and (iii) situational transitions driven by changes in action. Extensive evaluations with 20 (L)LMs of varying sizes and methods indicate that all three tasks in this process pose significant challenges, even for state-of-the-art LLMs and LMs after fine-tuning. Further analyses reveal potential causes for the underperformance of LLMs and demonstrate that pre-training them on large-scale conceptualization taxonomies can potentially enhance their metaphysical reasoning capabilities.

  Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI has emerged as a promising direction to integrate neural and symbolic reasoning. Unfortunately, little effort has been given to developing NeSy systems tailored to sequential/temporal problems. We identify symbolic automata (which combine the power of automata for temporal reasoning with that of propositional logic for static reasoning) as a suitable formalism for expressing knowledge in temporal domains. Focusing on the task of sequence classification and tagging we show that symbolic automata can be integrated with neural-based perception, under probabilistic semantics towards an end-to-end differentiable model. Our proposed hybrid model, termed NeSyA (Neuro Symbolic Automata) is shown to either scale or perform more accurately than previous NeSy systems in a synthetic benchmark and to provide benefits in terms of generalization compared to purely neural systems in a real-world event recognition task.

  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use, supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty, achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

  Existing refinement methods in LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems exhibit limited effectiveness. They often introduce new errors during the self-correction process and fail to detect and correct semantic inaccuracies. To address these gaps, we first introduce a clause-wise critique generation task along with a benchmark, SQLCriticBench, which performs fine-grained error localization including both syntax and semantic errors at the clause level. Furthermore, we introduce a variant of DPO for training our SQLCritic model, where the $\beta$ coefficient is adaptively changed according to the clause-level inconsistencies between the preferred and dispreferred critiques. We also propose an automatically training dataset curation pipeline which annotate clause-wise critique at scale in a cost-effective way. Experiments demonstrate that the SQLCritic model significantly improves SQL accuracy on the BIRD and Spider datasets, and the results on SQLCriticBench further reveals its superior critique capabilities compared to existing models.

  Recent efforts in LLM alignment have focused on constructing large-scale preference datasets via human or Artificial Intelligence (AI) annotators. However, such approaches rely on instance-wise supervision, incurring substantial annotation cost and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose ZEBRA - a model behavior-wise zero-annotation framework that constructs preference data by leveraging model behavior knowledge derived from benchmark performances. ZEBRA binarizes response pairs by evaluating the quality and similarity of their origin models, entirely bypassing instance-level annotation. This allows scalable, controllable, and cost-effective alignment data generation. Empirical results show that ZEBRA achieves alignment performance comparable to instance-supervised methods, despite requiring no manual or model-based labeling.

  The resurgence of autonomous agents built using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks has brought increased focus on LLMs' fundamental ability of tool or function calling. At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on a variety of models show that the best-performing model (GPT-4o) achieves a full sequence match accuracy of 28% and a win-rate of 60%, necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress.

  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have renewed focus on the design of reward functions that shape agent behavior. Manually designing reward functions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into rewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given their established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing methods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward RL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the semantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over infinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the continuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a single, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on absolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that cannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to the continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that translates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our approach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We also introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective optimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the policies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given omega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown communicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full knowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL. Empirical results show our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms discount-based methods across benchmarks.

  Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in AI and ML have transformed data science, yet increasing complexity and expertise requirements continue to hinder progress. While crowdsourcing platforms alleviate some challenges, high-level data science tasks remain labor-intensive and iterative. To overcome these limitations, we introduce R&D-Agent, a dual-agent framework for iterative exploration. The Researcher agent uses performance feedback to generate ideas, while the Developer agent refines code based on error feedback. By enabling multiple parallel exploration traces that merge and enhance one another, R&D-Agent narrows the gap between automated solutions and expert-level performance. Evaluated on MLE-Bench, R&D-Agent emerges as the top-performing machine learning engineering agent, demonstrating its potential to accelerate innovation and improve precision across diverse data science applications. We have open-sourced R&D-Agent on GitHub:this https URL.

  Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks. However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC, MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to 60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

  Training large reasoning models (LRMs) with reinforcement learning in STEM domains is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable problem sets. Existing synthesis methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, often generate oversimplified or uncheckable data, limiting model advancement on complex tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce SHARP, a unified approach to Synthesizing High-quality Aligned Reasoning Problems for LRMs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). SHARP encompasses a strategic set of self-alignment principles -- targeting graduate and Olympiad-level difficulty, rigorous logical consistency, and unambiguous, verifiable answers -- and a structured three-phase framework (Alignment, Instantiation, Inference) that ensures thematic diversity and fine-grained control over problem generation. We implement SHARP by leveraging a state-of-the-art LRM to infer and verify challenging STEM questions, then employ a reinforcement learning loop to refine the model's reasoning through verifiable reward signals. Experiments on benchmarks such as GPQA demonstrate that SHARP-augmented training substantially outperforms existing methods, markedly improving complex reasoning accuracy and pushing LRM performance closer to expert-level proficiency. Our contributions include the SHARP strategy, framework design, end-to-end implementation, and experimental evaluation of its effectiveness in elevating LRM reasoning capabilities.

  The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) constitutes a rapidly advancing research area. While MLLMs extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains challenging. This paper provides a systematic review of recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms, value-model-free and value-model-based methods, and analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Additionally, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and current limitations, and propose future research directions to address challenges such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and structured guide to RL-based multimodal reasoning.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts across various datasets. However, most existing multimodal math benchmarks are limited to single-visual contexts, which diverges from the multi-visual scenarios commonly encountered in real-world mathematical applications. To address this gap, we introduce MV-MATH: a meticulously curated dataset of 2,009 high-quality mathematical problems. Each problem integrates multiple images interleaved with text, derived from authentic K-12 scenarios, and enriched with detailed annotations. MV-MATH includes multiple-choice, free-form, and multi-step questions, covering 11 subject areas across 3 difficulty levels, and serves as a comprehensive and rigorous benchmark for assessing MLLMs' mathematical reasoning in multi-visual contexts. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in multi-visual math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on MV-MATH. Furthermore, we analyze the performance and error patterns of various models, providing insights into MLLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities within multi-visual settings.
