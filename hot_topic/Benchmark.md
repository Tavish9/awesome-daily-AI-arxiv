- **[STAR: Learning Diverse Robot Skill Abstractions through Rotation-Augmented Vector Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03863)**  `arXiv:2506.03863`  `cs.RO` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transforming complex actions into discrete skill abstractions has demonstrated strong potential for robotic manipulation. Existing approaches mainly leverage latent variable models, e.g., VQ-VAE, to learn skill abstractions through learned vectors (codebooks), while they suffer from codebook collapse and modeling the causal relationship between learned skills. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{S}kill \textbf{T}raining with \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{R}otation (\textbf{STAR}), a framework that advances both skill learning and composition to complete complex behaviors. Specifically, to prevent codebook collapse, we devise rotation-augmented residual skill quantization (RaRSQ). It encodes relative angles between encoder outputs into the gradient flow by rotation-based gradient mechanism. Points within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST) which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of STAR on both LIBERO benchmark and realworld tasks, with around 12\% improvement over the baselines.

  Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[An Open-source Capping Machine Suitable for Confined Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03743)**  `arXiv:2506.03743`  `cs.RO`

  In the context of self-driving laboratories (SDLs), ensuring automated and error-free capping is crucial, as it is a ubiquitous step in sample preparation. Automated capping in SDLs can occur in both large and small workspaces (e.g., inside a fume hood). However, most commercial capping machines are designed primarily for large spaces and are often too bulky for confined environments. Moreover, many commercial products are closed-source, which can make their integration into fully autonomous workflows difficult. This paper introduces an open-source capping machine suitable for compact spaces, which also integrates a vision system that recognises capping failure. The capping and uncapping processes are repeated 100 times each to validate the machine's design and performance. As a result, the capping machine reached a 100 % success rate for capping and uncapping. Furthermore, the machine sealing capacities are evaluated by capping 12 vials filled with solvents of different vapour pressures: water, ethanol and acetone. The vials are then weighed every 3 hours for three days. The machine's performance is benchmarked against an industrial capping machine (a Chemspeed station) and manual capping. The vials capped with the prototype lost 0.54 % of their content weight on average per day, while the ones capped with the Chemspeed and manually lost 0.0078 % and 0.013 %, respectively. The results show that the capping machine is a reasonable alternative to industrial and manual capping, especially when space and budget are limitations in SDLs.

- **[An Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer Inspired by Advanced Cooperative Predation for UAV Shortest Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03663)**  `arXiv:2506.03663`  `cs.RO`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in domains like military reconnaissance, emergency rescue, and logistics delivery, efficiently planning the shortest flight path has become a critical challenge. Traditional heuristic-based methods often suffer from the inability to escape from local optima, which limits their effectiveness in finding the shortest path. To address these issues, a novel Improved Grey Wolf Optimizer (IGWO) is presented in this study. The proposed IGWO incorporates an Advanced Cooperative Predation (ACP) and a Lens Opposition-based Learning Strategy (LOBL) in order to improve the optimization capability of the method. Simulation results show that IGWO ranks first in optimization performance on benchmark functions F1-F5, F7, and F9-F12, outperforming all other compared algorithms. Subsequently, IGWO is applied to UAV shortest path planning in various obstacle-laden environments. Simulation results show that the paths planned by IGWO are, on average, shorter than those planned by GWO, PSO, and WOA by 1.70m, 1.68m, and 2.00m, respectively, across four different maps.

- **[Adapt before Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03956)**  `arXiv:2506.03956`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Aojun Lu, Tao Feng, Hangjie Yuan, Chunhui Ding, Yanan Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL, prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile solution for PTM-based CL.

- **[Graph Flow Matching: Enhancing Image Generation with Neighbor-Aware Flow Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24434)**  `arXiv:2505.24434`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Md Shahriar Rahim Siddiqui, Moshe Eliasof, Eldad Haber_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

- **[Diffusing DeBias: Synthetic Bias Amplification for Model Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09564)**  `arXiv:2502.09564`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Massimiliano Ciranni, Vito Paolo Pastore, Roberto Di Via, Enzo Tartaglione, Francesca Odone, Vittorio Murino_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data whenever they are affected by strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels. This results in a form of bias affecting training data, which typically leads to unrecoverable weak generalization in prediction. This paper aims at facing this problem by leveraging bias amplification with generated synthetic data: we introduce Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods of unsupervised model debiasing exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models in data generation. Specifically, our approach adopts conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, which replace the original training set for learning an effective bias amplifier model that we subsequently incorporate into an end-to-end and a two-step unsupervised debiasing approach. By tackling the fundamental issue of bias-conflicting training samples memorization in learning auxiliary models, typical of this type of techniques, our proposed method beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling bias in deep learning models.

- **[Exploiting LLMs for Automatic Hypothesis Assessment via a Logit-Based Calibrated Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03444)**  `arXiv:2506.03444`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yue Gong, Raul Castro Fernandez_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As hypothesis generation becomes increasingly automated, a new bottleneck has emerged: hypothesis assessment. Modern systems can surface thousands of statistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little guidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention. In this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation: automatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of statistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and worth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry point in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming deeper scientific or causal hypotheses.To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge encoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation value of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value observed, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose the Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that transforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous predictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a benchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of 78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of 89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient. It also outperforms a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier in binary correlation prediction and achieves higher precision@K in hypothesis ranking. We further show that the prior generalizes to correlations not seen during LLM pretraining, reflecting context-sensitive reasoning rather than memorization.

- **[On-Policy RL with Optimal Reward Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23585)**  `arXiv:2505.23585`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO integrates a practically feasible formulation of the optimal reward baseline that minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is merged into the verl library atthis https URL.

- **[SAEBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Sparse Autoencoders in Language Model Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09532)**  `arXiv:2503.09532`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Adam Karvonen, Can Rager, Johnny Lin, Curt Tigges, Joseph Bloom, David Chanin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular technique for interpreting language model activations, and there is extensive recent work on improving SAE effectiveness. However, most prior work evaluates progress using unsupervised proxy metrics with unclear practical relevance. We introduce SAEBench, a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures SAE performance across eight diverse metrics, spanning interpretability, feature disentanglement and practical applications like unlearning. To enable systematic comparison, we open-source a suite of over 200 SAEs across eight recently proposed SAE architectures and training algorithms. Our evaluation reveals that gains on proxy metrics do not reliably translate to better practical performance. For instance, while Matryoshka SAEs slightly underperform on existing proxy metrics, they substantially outperform other architectures on feature disentanglement metrics; moreover, this advantage grows with SAE scale. By providing a standardized framework for measuring progress in SAE development, SAEBench enables researchers to study scaling trends and make nuanced comparisons between different SAE architectures and training methodologies. Our interactive interface enables researchers to flexibly visualize relationships between metrics across hundreds of open-source SAEs at:this http URL

- **[GRU: Mitigating the Trade-off between Unlearning and Retention for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09117)**  `arXiv:2503.09117`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Yue Wang, Qizhou Wang, Feng Liu, Wei Huang, Yali Du, Xiaojiang Du, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM) unlearning has demonstrated its essential role in removing privacy and copyright-related responses, crucial for their legal and safe applications. However, the pursuit of complete unlearning often comes with substantial costs due to its compromises in their general functionality, leading to a notorious trade-off between unlearning and retention. In examining the update process for unlearning dynamically, we find gradients hold essential information for revealing this trade-off. In particular, we look at the varying relationship between retention performance and directional disparities between gradients during unlearning. It motivates the sculpting of an update mechanism derived from gradients from two sources, i.e., harmful for retention and useful for unlearning. Accordingly, we propose Gradient Rectified Unlearning (GRU), an enhanced unlearning framework controlling the updating gradients in a geometry-focused and optimization-driven manner such that their side impacts on other, unrelated responses can be minimized. Specifically, GRU derives a closed-form solution to project the unlearning gradient onto the orthogonal space of that gradient harmful for retention, ensuring minimal deviation from its original direction under the condition that overall performance is retained. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that GRU, as a general framework, is straightforward to implement and efficiently enhances a range of baseline methods through its adaptable and compatible characteristics. Additionally, experimental results show its broad effectiveness across a diverse set of benchmarks for LLM unlearning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available atthis https URL.

- **[Advancing Multimodal Reasoning: From Optimized Cold Start to Staged Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04207)**  `arXiv:2506.04207`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL` `cs.CV`  
  _Shuang Chen, Yue Guo, Zhaochen Su, Yafu Li, Yulun Wu, Jiacheng Chen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.

- **[Scaling CrossQ with Weight Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03758)**  `arXiv:2506.03758`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Daniel Palenicek, Florian Vogt, Jan Peters_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data (UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics which are emphasized by higher UTDs, particularly Q-bias explosion and the growing magnitude of critic network weights. To address this, we integrate weight normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training, prevents potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios, achieving competitive or superior performance across a range of challenging tasks on the DeepMind control benchmark, notably the complex dog and humanoid environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as network resets, and offers a robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.

  _Jiayi Wan, Xiang Zhu, Fanzhen Liu, Wei Fan, Xiaolong Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for applications in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). In order to mitigate the privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However, these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominant paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous, alternating generation and training in a batch setting where rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same model. This approach stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency: generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model updates, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a fully asynchronous RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves up to 2.77$\times$ training speedup compared to synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available atthis https URL.

- **[Anomaly Detection in Complex Dynamical Systems: A Systematic Framework Using Embedding Theory and Physics-Inspired Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19307)**  `arXiv:2502.19307`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Michael Somma, Thomas Gallien, Branka Stojanovic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan aeroengine degradation. TDC-AE outperforms LSTMs and Transformers while achieving a nearly 200x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.

  _Jinho Chang, Jong Chul Ye_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the emergence of diffusion models as a frontline generative model, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques with conditional diffusion models. However, the unavoidable discreteness of a molecule makes it difficult for a diffusion model to connect raw data with highly complex conditions like natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. By recognizing that the suitable latent space design is the key to the diffusion model performance, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract novel feature space from text data that embeds the unique characteristics of the molecule structure. Experiments show that LDMol outperforms the existing autoregressive baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark, being one of the first diffusion models that outperforms autoregressive models in textual data generation with a better choice of the latent domain. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.

- **[EPIC: Graph Augmentation with Edit Path Interpolation via Learnable Cost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01310)**  `arXiv:2306.01310`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jaeseung Heo, Seungbeom Lee, Sungsoo Ahn, Dongwoo Kim_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data augmentation plays a critical role in improving model performance across various domains, but it becomes challenging with graph data due to their complex and irregular structure. To address this issue, we propose EPIC (Edit Path Interpolation via learnable Cost), a novel interpolation-based method for augmenting graph datasets. To interpolate between two graphs lying in an irregular domain, EPIC leverages the concept of graph edit distance, constructing an edit path that represents the transformation process between two graphs via edit operations. Moreover, our method introduces a context-sensitive cost model that accounts for the importance of specific edit operations formulated through a learning framework. This allows for a more nuanced transformation process, where the edit distance is not merely count-based but reflects meaningful graph attributes. With randomly sampled graphs from the edit path, we enrich the training set to enhance the generalization capability of classification models. Experimental evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing augmentation techniques in many tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphons, as limit objects of dense graph sequences, play a central role in the statistical analysis of network data. However, existing graphon estimation methods often struggle with scalability to large networks and resolution-independent approximation, due to their reliance on estimating latent variables or costly metrics such as the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. In this work, we propose a novel, scalable graphon estimator that directly recovers the graphon via moment matching, leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). Our approach avoids latent variable modeling by training an INR--mapping coordinates to graphon values--to match empirical subgraph counts (i.e., moments) from observed graphs. This direct estimation mechanism yields a polynomial-time solution and crucially sidesteps the combinatorial complexity of Gromov-Wasserstein optimization. Building on foundational results, we establish a theoretical guarantee: when the observed subgraph motifs sufficiently represent those of the true graphon (a condition met with sufficiently large or numerous graph samples), the estimated graphon achieves a provable upper bound in cut distance from the ground truth. Additionally, we introduce MomentMixup, a data augmentation technique that performs mixup in the moment space to enhance graphon-based learning. Our graphon estimation method achieves strong empirical performance--demonstrating high accuracy on small graphs and superior computational efficiency on large graphs--outperforming state-of-the-art scalable estimators in 75\% of benchmark settings and matching them in the remaining cases. Furthermore, MomentMixup demonstrated improved graph classification accuracy on the majority of our benchmarks.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities when trained with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. However, the long and verbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models (LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the distillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate the reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT condensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling supervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both answer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our rationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem understanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical analysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace, especially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues) and the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless reasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation method, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of each CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an analogy to preserving the "edge" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the initial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical continuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and benchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving lossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore thought-level CoT condensation for efficient reasoning model distillation.

  Reasoning models have made rapid progress on many benchmarks involving math, code, and science. Yet, there are still many open questions about the best training recipes for reasoning since state-of-the-art models often rely on proprietary datasets with little to no public information available. To address this, the goal of the OpenThoughts project is to create open-source datasets for training reasoning models. After initial explorations, our OpenThoughts2-1M dataset led to OpenThinker2-32B, the first model trained on public reasoning data to match DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B on standard reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and LiveCodeBench. We then improve our dataset further by systematically investigating each step of our data generation pipeline with 1,000+ controlled experiments, which led to OpenThoughts3. Scaling the pipeline to 1.2M examples and using QwQ-32B as teacher yields our OpenThinker3-7B model, which achieves state-of-the-art results: 53% on AIME 2025, 51% on LiveCodeBench 06/24-01/25, and 54% on GPQA Diamond. All of our datasets and models are available onthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Failure triage in design functional verification is critical but time-intensive, relying on manual specification reviews, log inspections, and waveform analyses. While machine learning (ML) has improved areas like stimulus generation and coverage closure, its application to RTL-level simulation failure triage, particularly for large designs, remains limited. VCDiag offers an efficient, adaptable approach using VCD data to classify failing waveforms and pinpoint likely failure locations. In the largest experiment, VCDiag achieves over 94% accuracy in identifying the top three most likely modules. The framework introduces a novel signal selection and statistical compression approach, achieving over 120x reduction in raw data size while preserving features essential for classification. It can also be integrated into diverse Verilog/SystemVerilog designs and testbenches.

  Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1)

  _Zhaoyang Chen, Cody Fleming_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations, actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior, suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model, based on three key findings:Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity for optimization.Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and enhances both sample efficiency and final performance.Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability.We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular, reusable, and composable training pipelines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has been gaining popularity due to its successful adaptation to large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Privacy-preserving Collaborative Mixture-of-Experts (PC-MoE), which leverages the sparsity of the MoE architecture for memory-efficient decentralized collaborative LLM training, enabling multiple parties with limited GPU-memory and data resources to collectively train more capable LLMs than they could achieve individually. At the same time, this approach protects training data privacy of each participant by keeping training data, as well as parts of the forward pass signal and gradients locally within each party. By design, PC-MoE synergistically combines the strengths of distributed computation with strong confidentiality assurances. Unlike most privacy-preserving schemes, which pay for confidentiality with lower task accuracy, our framework breaks that trade-off: across seven popular LLM benchmarks, it almost matches (and sometimes exceeds) the performance and convergence rate of a fully centralized model, enjoys near 70% peak GPU RAM reduction, while being fully robust against reconstruction attacks.

  Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently, language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.

  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated technique to design optimal neural network architectures for a specific workload. Conventionally, evaluating candidate networks in NAS involves extensive training, which requires significant time and computational resources. To address this, training-free NAS has been proposed to expedite network evaluation with minimal search time. However, state-of-the-art training-free NAS algorithms struggle to precisely distinguish well-performing networks from poorly-performing networks, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions and consequently sub-optimal top-1 network accuracy. Moreover, they are less effective in activation function exploration. To tackle the challenges, this paper proposes RBFleX-NAS, a novel training-free NAS framework that accounts for both activation outputs and input features of the last layer with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. We also present a detection algorithm to identify optimal hyperparameters using the obtained activation outputs and input feature maps. We verify the efficacy of RBFleX-NAS over a variety of NAS benchmarks. RBFleX-NAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art training-free NAS methods in terms of top-1 accuracy, achieving this with short search time in NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-SSS. In addition, it demonstrates higher Kendall correlation compared to layer-based training-free NAS algorithms. Furthermore, we propose NAFBee, a new activation design space that extends the activation type to encompass various commonly used functions. In this extended design space, RBFleX-NAS demonstrates its superiority by accurately identifying the best-performing network during activation function search, providing a significant advantage over other NAS algorithms.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning algorithms aim to learn from a sequence of tasks, making the training distribution non-stationary. The majority of existing continual learning approaches in the literature rely on heuristics and do not provide learning guarantees. In this paper, we present a new method called Continual Pick-to-Learn (CoP2L), which is able to retain the most representative samples for each task in an efficient way. CoP2L combines the Pick-to-Learn algorithm (rooted in the sample compression theory) and the experience replay continual learning scheme. This allows us to provide non-vacuous upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors, numerically computable after each task. We empirically evaluate our approach on several standard continual learning benchmarks across Class-Incremental, Task-Incremental, and Domain-Incremental settings. Our results show that CoP2L is highly competitive across all setups, often outperforming existing baselines, and significantly mitigating catastrophic forgetting compared to vanilla experience replay in the Class-Incremental setting. It is possible to leverage the bounds provided by CoP2L in practical scenarios to certify the predictor reliability on previously learned tasks, in order to improve the trustworthiness of the continual learning algorithm.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning models trained on tabular data are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even in realistic scenarios where attackers only have access to the model's outputs. Since tabular data contains complex interdependencies among features, it presents a unique challenge for adversarial samples which must maintain coherence and respect these interdependencies to remain indistinguishable from benign data. Moreover, existing attack evaluation metrics-such as the success rate, perturbation magnitude, and query count-fail to account for this challenge. To address those gaps, we propose a technique for perturbing dependent features while preserving sample coherence. In addition, we introduce Class-Specific Anomaly Detection (CSAD), an effective novel anomaly detection approach, along with concrete metrics for assessing the quality of tabular adversarial attacks. CSAD evaluates adversarial samples relative to their predicted class distribution, rather than a broad benign distribution. It ensures that subtle adversarial perturbations, which may appear coherent in other classes, are correctly identified as anomalies. We integrate SHAP explainability techniques to detect inconsistencies in model decision-making, extending CSAD for SHAP-based anomaly detection. Our evaluation incorporates both anomaly detection rates with SHAP-based assessments to provide a more comprehensive measure of adversarial sample quality. We evaluate various attack strategies, examining black-box query-based and transferability-based gradient attacks across four target models. Experiments on benchmark tabular datasets reveal key differences in the attacker's risk and effort and attack quality, offering insights into the strengths, limitations, and trade-offs faced by attackers and defenders. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on adversarial attacks and defense development in the tabular domain.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a popular framework for unsupervised learning and data generation. A plethora of methods have been proposed focusing on improving VAEs, with the incorporation of adversarial objectives and the integration of prior learning mechanisms being prominent directions. When it comes to the former, an indicative instance is the recently introduced family of Introspective VAEs aiming at ensuring that a low likelihood is assigned to unrealistic samples. In this study, we focus on the Soft-IntroVAE (S-IntroVAE), one of only two members of the Introspective VAE family, the other being the original IntroVAE. We select S-IntroVAE for its state-of-the-art status and its training stability. In particular, we investigate the implication of incorporating a multimodal and trainable prior into this S-IntroVAE. Namely, we formulate the prior as a third player and show that when trained in cooperation with the decoder constitutes an effective way for prior learning, which shares the Nash Equilibrium with the vanilla S-IntroVAE. Furthermore, based on a modified formulation of the optimal ELBO in S-IntroVAE, we develop theoretically motivated regularizations, namely (i) adaptive variance clipping to stabilize training when learning the prior and (ii) responsibility regularization to discourage the formation of inactive prior modes. Finally, we perform a series of targeted experiments on a 2D density estimation benchmark and in an image generation setting comprised of the (F)-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrating the effect of prior learning in S-IntroVAE in generation and representation learning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT) problem has attracted the special attention of the ML community. In this problem, given two distributions supported on two (possibly different) spaces, one has to find the most isometric map between them. In the discrete variant of GWOT, the task is to learn an assignment between given discrete sets of points. In the more advanced continuous formulation, one aims at recovering a parametric mapping between unknown continuous distributions based on i.i.d. samples derived from them. The clear geometrical intuition behind the GWOT makes it a natural choice for several practical use cases, giving rise to a number of proposed solvers. Some of them claim to solve the continuous version of the problem. At the same time, GWOT is notoriously hard, both theoretically and numerically. Moreover, all existing continuous GWOT solvers still heavily rely on discrete techniques. Natural questions arise: to what extent do existing methods unravel the GWOT problem, what difficulties do they encounter, and under which conditions they are successful? Our benchmark paper is an attempt to answer these questions. We specifically focus on the continuous GWOT as the most interesting and debatable setup. We crash-test existing continuous GWOT approaches on different scenarios, carefully record and analyze the obtained results, and identify issues. Our findings experimentally testify that the scientific community is still missing a reliable continuous GWOT solver, which necessitates further research efforts. As the first step in this direction, we propose a new continuous GWOT method which does not rely on discrete techniques and partially solves some of the problems of the competitors.

  Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source atthis https URL.

  The real world is messy and unstructured. Uncovering critical information often requires active, goal-driven exploration. It remains to be seen whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which recently emerged as a popular zero-shot tool in many difficult tasks, can operate effectively in such conditions. In this paper, we answer this question by introducing FlySearch, a 3D, outdoor, photorealistic environment for searching and navigating to objects in complex scenes. We define three sets of scenarios with varying difficulty and observe that state-of-the-art VLMs cannot reliably solve even the simplest exploration tasks, with the gap to human performance increasing as the tasks get harder. We identify a set of central causes, ranging from vision hallucination, through context misunderstanding, to task planning failures, and we show that some of them can be addressed by finetuning. We publicly release the benchmark, scenarios, and the underlying codebase.

  The rapid global loss of biodiversity, particularly among insects, represents an urgent ecological crisis. Current methods for insect species discovery are manual, slow, and severely constrained by taxonomic expertise, hindering timely conservation actions. We introduce TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models for the challenging problem of identifying unknown, potentially undescribed insect species from image data. Our benchmark dataset combines a mix of expertly annotated images of insect species likely known to frontier AI models, and images of rare and poorly known species, for which few/no publicly available images exist. These images were collected from underexplored biodiversity hotspots, realistically mimicking open-world discovery scenarios faced by ecologists. The benchmark assesses models' proficiency in hierarchical taxonomic classification, their capability to detect and abstain from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples representing novel species, and their ability to generate explanations aligned with expert taxonomic knowledge. Notably, top-performing models achieve over 90\% F1 at the Order level on known species, but drop below 2\% at the Species level, highlighting the sharp difficulty gradient from coarse to fine taxonomic prediction (Order $\rightarrow$ Family $\rightarrow$ Genus $\rightarrow$ Species). TerraIncognita will be updated regularly, and by committing to quarterly dataset expansions (of both known and novel species), will provide an evolving platform for longitudinal benchmarking of frontier AI methods. All TerraIncognita data, results, and future updates are available \href{this https URL}{here}.

  The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame. (2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only 52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies (Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains. We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, real-time surveillance violence detection.

  Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

  Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on MM-HalBench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

  Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.

  Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

  _Xiaoyi Liu, Hao Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial, multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions, advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network (AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout, zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation -- to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining robust across dynamic environments, establishing a new world-model based, multimodal pathway to physical intelligence.

  Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human health. This proposed hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method aims to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression accuracy. These results have affirmed po-tential application of this method in several real-time situations with improvement in human health life span

  Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems. Project website:this https URL

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete representations for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, unified image tokenizers have sparked exploration within research community, which is designed to capture high-level semantic features for understanding and retaining low-level pixel features for generation. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss for semantic distillation and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through a novel semantic-guided hierarchical codebook, which builds pixel sub-codebooks on a pretrained semantic codebook. This design decouples semantic and pixel both in terms of structure and training strategy, enabling the tokenizer to capture pixel features while retaining its ability to comprehend high-level semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves SOTA performance in image reconstruction and multimodal understanding under LLaVA-v1.5 setting. Further, we develop a unified MLLM with SemHiTok, which exhibits superior performance across multimodal understanding and generation tasks. For understanding, SemHiTok achieves impressive performance on most benchmarks. For generation, our model achieves SOTA performance on MJHQ30K in unified MLLMs.

  Recent research has increasingly focused on multimodal mathematical reasoning, particularly emphasizing the creation of relevant datasets and benchmarks. Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning. Our benchmark and code would be available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL\_modality\_role}.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.

  Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7¬∞, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

  Despite achieving outstanding performance on various cross-modal tasks, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucination issues, manifesting as inconsistencies between their generated responses and the corresponding images. Prior research has implicated that the low quality of instruction data, particularly the skewed balance between positive and negative samples, is a significant contributor to model hallucinations. Recently, researchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as LRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our investigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit specificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies significantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the hallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby diminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we propose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that tailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG consists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary information from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis; and targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based on diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more effective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.

  We introduce Oxford Day-and-Night, a large-scale, egocentric dataset for novel view synthesis (NVS) and visual relocalisation under challenging lighting conditions. Existing datasets often lack crucial combinations of features such as ground-truth 3D geometry, wide-ranging lighting variation, and full 6DoF motion. Oxford Day-and-Night addresses these gaps by leveraging Meta ARIA glasses to capture egocentric video and applying multi-session SLAM to estimate camera poses, reconstruct 3D point clouds, and align sequences captured under varying lighting conditions, including both day and night. The dataset spans over 30 $\mathrm{km}$ of recorded trajectories and covers an area of 40,000 $\mathrm{m}^2$, offering a rich foundation for egocentric 3D vision research. It supports two core benchmarks, NVS and relocalisation, providing a unique platform for evaluating models in realistic and diverse environments.

  Unlocking spatial reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is crucial for enabling intelligent interaction with 3D environments. While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.

  Recent advances in text-to-video generation have sparked interest in generative video editing tasks. Previous methods often rely on task-specific architectures (e.g., additional adapter modules) or dedicated customizations (e.g., DDIM inversion), which limit the integration of versatile editing conditions and the unification of various editing tasks. In this paper, we introduce UNified In-Context Video Editing (UNIC), a simple yet effective framework that unifies diverse video editing tasks within a single model in an in-context manner. To achieve this unification, we represent the inputs of various video editing tasks as three types of tokens: the source video tokens, the noisy video latent, and the multi-modal conditioning tokens that vary according to the specific editing task. Based on this formulation, our key insight is to integrate these three types into a single consecutive token sequence and jointly model them using the native attention operations of DiT, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific adapter designs. Nevertheless, direct task unification under this framework is challenging, leading to severe token collisions and task confusion due to the varying video lengths and diverse condition modalities across tasks. To address these, we introduce task-aware RoPE to facilitate consistent temporal positional encoding, and condition bias that enables the model to clearly differentiate different editing tasks. This allows our approach to adaptively perform different video editing tasks by referring the source video and varying condition tokens "in context", and support flexible task composition. To validate our method, we construct a unified video editing benchmark containing six representative video editing tasks. Results demonstrate that our unified approach achieves superior performance on each task and exhibits emergent task composition abilities.

  Object detectors often suffer a decrease in performance due to the large domain gap between the training data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain). Diffusion-based generative models have shown remarkable abilities in generating high-quality and diverse images, suggesting their potential for extracting valuable feature from various domains. To effectively leverage the cross-domain feature representation of diffusion models, in this paper, we train a detector with frozen-weight diffusion model on the source domain, then employ it as a teacher model to generate pseudo labels on the unlabeled target domain, which are used to guide the supervised learning of the student model on the target domain. We refer to this approach as Diffusion Domain Teacher (DDT). By employing this straightforward yet potent framework, we significantly improve cross-domain object detection performance without compromising the inference speed. Our method achieves an average mAP improvement of 21.2% compared to the baseline on 6 datasets from three common cross-domain detection benchmarks (Cross-Camera, Syn2Real, Real2Artistic}, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average of 5.7% mAP. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently brings improvements even in more powerful and complex models, highlighting broadly applicable and effective domain adaptation capability of our DDT.

  Currently, the most dominant approach to establishing language-image alignment is to pre-train text and image encoders jointly through contrastive learning, such as CLIP and its variants. In this work, we question whether such a costly joint training is necessary. In particular, we investigate if a pre-trained fixed large language model (LLM) offers a good enough text encoder to guide visual representation learning. That is, we propose to learn Language-Image alignment with a Fixed Text encoder (LIFT) from an LLM by training only the image encoder. Somewhat surprisingly, through comprehensive benchmarking and ablation studies, we find that this much simplified framework LIFT is highly effective and it outperforms CLIP in most scenarios that involve compositional understanding and long captions, while achieving considerable gains in computational efficiency. Our work takes a first step towards systematically exploring how text embeddings from LLMs can guide visual learning and suggests an alternative design choice for learning language-aligned visual representations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  Achieving high-fidelity 3D surface reconstruction while preserving fine details remains challenging, especially in the presence of materials with complex reflectance properties and without a dense-view setup. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework that incorporates multi-view normal and optionally reflectance maps into radiance-based surface reconstruction. Our approach employs a pixel-wise joint re-parametrization of reflectance and surface normals, representing them as a vector of radiances under simulated, varying illumination. This formulation enables seamless incorporation into standard surface reconstruction pipelines, such as traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) frameworks or modern neural volume rendering (NVR) ones. Combined with the latter, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) benchmark datasets, including DiLiGenT-MV, LUCES-MV and Skoltech3D. In particular, our method excels in reconstructing fine-grained details and handling challenging visibility conditions. The present paper is an extended version of the earlier conference paper by Brument et al. (in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2024), featuring an accelerated and more robust algorithm as well as a broader empirical evaluation.

  Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.

  In this work, we study the Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model. Redundant vision tokens consume a significant amount of computational memory and resources. Therefore, many previous works compress them in the Vision Projector to reduce the number of vision tokens. However, simply compressing in the Vision Projector can lead to the loss of visual information, especially for tasks that rely on fine-grained spatial relationships, such as OCR and Chart \& Table Understanding. To address this problem, we propose Vision Remember, which is inserted between the LLM decoder layers to allow vision tokens to re-memorize vision features. Specifically, we retain multi-level vision features and resample them with the vision tokens that have interacted with the text token. During the resampling process, each vision token only attends to a local region in vision features, which is referred to as saliency-enhancing local attention. Saliency-enhancing local attention not only improves computational efficiency but also captures more fine-grained contextual information and spatial relationships within the region. Comprehensive experiments on multiple visual understanding benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method when combined with various Efficient Vision Projectors, showing performance gains without sacrificing efficiency. Based on Vision Remember, LLaVA-VR with only 2B parameters is also superior to previous representative MLLMs such as Tokenpacker-HD-7B and DeepSeek-VL-7B.

  In this work, we propose a practical cross-domain few-shot learning (pCDFSL) task, where a large-scale pre-trained model like CLIP can be easily deployed on a target dataset. The goal is to simultaneously classify all unseen classes under extreme domain shifts, by utilizing only a few labeled samples per class. The pCDFSL paradigm is source-free and moves beyond artificially created episodic training and testing regimes followed by existing CDFSL frameworks, making it more challenging and relevant to real-world applications. Towards that goal, we propose a novel framework, termed MIST (MultIple STochastic Prompt tuning), where multiple stochastic prompts are utilized to handle significant domain and semantic shifts. Specifically, multiple prompts are learnt for each class, effectively capturing multiple peaks in the input data. Furthermore, instead of representing the weights of the multiple prompts as point-estimates, we model them as learnable Gaussian distributions with two different strategies, encouraging an efficient exploration of the prompt parameter space, which mitigate overfitting due to the few labeled training samples. Extensive experiments and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on four CDFSL benchmarks adapted to this setting, show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  Event-based sensors offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based cameras, especially in scenarios involving rapid motion or challenging lighting conditions. However, event data frequently suffers from considerable noise, negatively impacting the performance and robustness of deep learning models. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by applying filtering algorithms to the event stream, but this may also remove some of relevant data. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-injection training methodology designed to enhance the neural networks robustness against varying levels of event noise. Our approach introduces controlled noise directly into the training data, enabling models to learn noise-resilient representations. We have conducted extensive evaluations of the proposed method using multiple benchmark datasets (N-Caltech101, N-Cars, and Mini N-ImageNet) and various network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers, Spiking Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks. Experimental results show that our noise-injection training strategy achieves stable performance over a range of noise intensities, consistently outperforms event-filtering techniques, and achieves the highest average classification accuracy, making it a viable alternative to traditional event-data filtering methods in an object classification system.

  This paper presents the first study on adapting the visual in-context learning (V-ICL) paradigm to optical character recognition tasks, specifically focusing on text removal and segmentation. Most existing V-ICL generalists employ a reasoning-as-reconstruction approach: they turn to using a straightforward image-label compositor as the prompt and query input, and then masking the query label to generate the desired output. This direct prompt confines the model to a challenging single-step reasoning process. To address this, we propose a task-chaining compositor in the form of image-removal-segmentation, providing an enhanced prompt that elicits reasoning with enriched intermediates. Additionally, we introduce context-aware aggregation, integrating the chained prompt pattern into the latent query representation, thereby strengthening the model's in-context reasoning. We also consider the issue of visual heterogeneity, which complicates the selection of homogeneous demonstrations in text recognition. Accordingly, this is effectively addressed through a simple self-prompting strategy, preventing the model's in-context learnability from devolving into specialist-like, context-free inference. Collectively, these insights culminate in our ConText model, which achieves new state-of-the-art across both in- and out-of-domain benchmarks. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Fully sparse 3D detectors have recently gained significant attention due to their efficiency in long-range detection. However, sparse 3D detectors extract features only from non-empty voxels, which impairs long-range interactions and causes the center feature missing. The former weakens the feature extraction capability, while the latter hinders network optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce the Fully Sparse Hybrid Network (FSHNet). FSHNet incorporates a proposed SlotFormer block to enhance the long-range feature extraction capability of existing sparse encoders. The SlotFormer divides sparse voxels using a slot partition approach, which, compared to traditional window partition, provides a larger receptive field. Additionally, we propose a dynamic sparse label assignment strategy to deeply optimize the network by providing more high-quality positive samples. To further enhance performance, we introduce a sparse upsampling module to refine downsampled voxels, preserving fine-grained details crucial for detecting small objects. Extensive experiments on the Waymo, nuScenes, and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FSHNet. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) entails assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image using textual descriptions, typically leveraging world models such as CLIP. To enhance out-of-domain generalization, we propose Cost Aggregation with Optimal Transport (OV-COAST) for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. To align visual-language features within the framework of optimal transport theory, we employ cost volume to construct a cost matrix, which quantifies the distance between two distributions. Our approach adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: in the first stage, the optimal transport problem is solved using cost volume via Sinkhorn distance to obtain an alignment solution; in the second stage, this solution is used to guide the training of the CAT-Seg model. We evaluate state-of-the-art OVSS models on the MESS benchmark, where our approach notably improves the performance of the cost-aggregation model CAT-Seg with ViT-B backbone, achieving superior results, surpassing CAT-Seg by 1.72 % and SAN-B by 4.9 % mIoU.

  Utilizing multi-modal data enhances scene understanding by providing complementary semantic and geometric information. Existing methods fuse features or distill knowledge from multiple modalities into a unified representation, improving robustness but restricting each modality's ability to fully leverage its strengths in different situations. We reformulate multi-modal semantic segmentation as a mask-level classification task and propose BiXFormer, which integrates Unified Modality Matching (UMM) and Cross Modality Alignment (CMA) to maximize modality effectiveness and handle missing modalities. Specifically, BiXFormer first categorizes multi-modal inputs into RGB and X, where X represents any non-RGB modalities, e.g., depth, allowing separate processing for each. This design leverages the well-established pretraining for RGB, while addressing the relative lack of attention to X modalities. Then, we propose UMM, which includes Modality Agnostic Matching (MAM) and Complementary Matching (CM). MAM assigns labels to features from all modalities without considering modality differences, leveraging each modality's strengths. CM then reassigns unmatched labels to remaining unassigned features within their respective modalities, ensuring that each available modality contributes to the final prediction and mitigating the impact of missing modalities. Moreover, to further facilitate UMM, we introduce CMA, which enhances the weaker queries assigned in CM by aligning them with optimally matched queries from MAM. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving significant improvements in mIoU of +2.75% and +22.74% over the prior arts.

  With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, text-to-image generation has achieved significant progress in image resolution, detail fidelity, and semantic alignment, particularly with models like Stable Diffusion 3.5, Stable Diffusion XL, and FLUX 1. However, generating emotionally expressive and abstract artistic images remains a major challenge, largely due to the lack of large-scale, fine-grained emotional datasets. To address this gap, we present the EmoArt Dataset -- one of the most comprehensive emotion-annotated art datasets to date. It contains 132,664 artworks across 56 painting styles (e.g., Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Art), offering rich stylistic and cultural diversity. Each image includes structured annotations: objective scene descriptions, five key visual attributes (brushwork, composition, color, line, light), binary arousal-valence labels, twelve emotion categories, and potential art therapy effects. Using EmoArt, we systematically evaluate popular text-to-image diffusion models for their ability to generate emotionally aligned images from text. Our work provides essential data and benchmarks for emotion-driven image synthesis and aims to advance fields such as affective computing, multimodal learning, and computational art, enabling applications in art therapy and creative design.

  A major challenge in finger vein recognition is the lack of large-scale public datasets. Existing datasets contain few identities and limited samples per finger, restricting the advancement of deep learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce FVeinSyn, a synthetic generator capable of producing diverse finger vein patterns with rich intra-class variations. Using FVeinSyn, we created FingerVeinSyn-5M -- the largest available finger vein dataset -- containing 5 million samples from 50,000 unique fingers, each with 100 variations including shift, rotation, scale, roll, varying exposure levels, skin scattering blur, optical blur, and motion blur. FingerVeinSyn-5M is also the first to offer fully annotated finger vein images, supporting deep learning applications in this field. Models pretrained on FingerVeinSyn-5M and fine-tuned with minimal real data achieve an average 53.91\% performance gain across multiple benchmarks.

  Current benchmarks for sign language recognition (SLR) focus mainly on isolated SLR, while there are limited datasets for continuous SLR (CSLR), which recognizes sequences of signs in a video. Additionally, existing CSLR datasets are collected in controlled settings, which restricts their effectiveness in building robust real-world CSLR systems. To address these limitations, we present Isharah, a large multi-scene dataset for CSLR. It is the first dataset of its type and size that has been collected in an unconstrained environment using signers' smartphone cameras. This setup resulted in high variations of recording settings, camera distances, angles, and resolutions. This variation helps with developing sign language understanding models capable of handling the variability and complexity of real-world scenarios. The dataset consists of 30,000 video clips performed by 18 deaf and professional signers. Additionally, the dataset is linguistically rich as it provides a gloss-level annotation for all dataset's videos, making it useful for developing CSLR and sign language translation (SLT) systems. This paper also introduces multiple sign language understanding benchmarks, including signer-independent and unseen-sentence CSLR, along with gloss-based and gloss-free SLT.

  Detecting lesions in Computed Tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task in medical image processing due to the diverse types, sizes, and locations of lesions. Recently, various one-stage and two-stage framework networks have been developed to focus on lesion localization. We introduce a one-stage lesion detection framework, PDSE, by redesigning Retinanet to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency for detecting lesions in multimodal CT images. Specifically, we enhance the path aggregation flow by incorporating a low-level feature map. Additionally, to improve model representation, we utilize the adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block and integrate channel feature map attention. This approach has resulted in achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Our method significantly improves the detection of small and multiscaled objects. When evaluated against other advanced algorithms on the public DeepLesion benchmark, our algorithm achieved an mAP of over 0.20.

  The field of controllable image generation has seen significant advancements, with various architectures improving generation layout consistency with control signals. However, contemporary methods still face challenges in bridging the semantic gap between input text prompts with sparse semantics and the target images, often over-relying on low-level control signals to infer regional details. To address this challenge, we propose ControlThinker, a novel framework that employs a "comprehend-then-generate" paradigm. Firstly, by incentivizing the visual reasoning capability of a MLLM, latent semantics from control images are mined to enrich text prompts. This enriched semantic understanding then seamlessly aids in image generation without the need for additional complex modifications. To further tackle the uncertainty arising from the ambiguity of control images, we encourage broader exploration of reasoning trajectories and select the optimal one using a metric-based output reward model (ORM). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ControlThinker effectively mitigates the semantic gap between raw text prompts and target images, resulting in improved visual quality and semantic consistency across a wide range of benchmarks. The code and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

  Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation is a complex and challenging task that integrates the paradigms of computer vision and natural language processing. Existing datasets for RRSIS suffer from critical limitations in resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models. To facilitate the development of this field, we introduce NWPU-Refer, the largest and most diverse RRSIS dataset to date, comprising 15,003 high-resolution images (1024-2048px) spanning 30+ countries with 49,745 annotated targets supporting single-object, multi-object, and non-object segmentation scenarios. Additionally, we propose the Multi-scale Referring Segmentation Network (MRSNet), a novel framework tailored for the unique demands of RRSIS. MRSNet introduces two key innovations: (1) an Intra-scale Feature Interaction Module (IFIM) that captures fine-grained details within each encoder stage, and (2) a Hierarchical Feature Interaction Module (HFIM) to enable seamless cross-scale feature fusion, preserving spatial integrity while enhancing discriminative power. Extensive experiments conducte on the proposed NWPU-Refer dataset demonstrate that MRSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) focuses on transferring source domain knowledge to the target domain under both domain shift and unknown category shift. Its main challenge lies in identifying common class samples and aligning them. Current methods typically obtain target domain semantics centers from an unconstrained continuous image representation space. Due to domain shift and the unknown number of clusters, these centers often result in complex and less robust alignment algorithm. In this paper, based on vision-language models, we search for semantic centers in a semantically meaningful and discrete text representation space. The constrained space ensures almost no domain bias and appropriate semantic granularity for these centers, enabling a simple and robust adaptation algorithm. Specifically, we propose TArget Semantics Clustering (TASC) via Text Representations, which leverages information maximization as a unified objective and involves two stages. First, with the frozen encoders, a greedy search-based framework is used to search for an optimal set of text embeddings to represent target semantics. Second, with the search results fixed, encoders are refined based on gradient descent, simultaneously achieving robust domain alignment and private class clustering. Additionally, we propose Universal Maximum Similarity (UniMS), a scoring function tailored for detecting open-set samples in UniDA. Experimentally, we evaluate the universality of UniDA algorithms under four category shift scenarios. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

  The Arrow of Time (AoT)-time's irreversible flow shaping physical events-is fundamental to video comprehension, yet remains a significant challenge for modern large multimodal models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to perceive and utilize temporal directionality in video when responding to language queries, obstructing deeper temporal understanding. We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.

  Recent works on optical flow estimation use neural networks to predict the flow field that maps positions of one image to positions of the other. These networks consist of a feature extractor, a correlation volume, and finally several refinement steps. These refinement steps mimic the iterative refinements performed by classical optimization algorithms and are usually implemented by neural layers (e.g., GRU) which are recurrently executed for a fixed and pre-determined number of steps. However, relying on a fixed number of steps may result in suboptimal performance because it is not tailored to the input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting the derivative of the flow using a continuous model, namely neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). One key advantage of this approach is its capacity to model an equilibrium process, dynamically adjusting the number of compute steps based on the data at hand. By following a particular neural architecture, ODE solver, and associated hyperparameters, our proposed model can replicate the exact same updates as recurrent cells used in existing works, offering greater generality. Through extensive experimental analysis on optical flow benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive improvement over baseline and existing models, all while requiring only a single refinement step.

  Plant Disease Detection (PDD) is a key aspect of precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning methods often rely on extensively annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and costly to generate. Self-supervised Learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by exploiting the abundance of unlabeled data. However, most existing SSL approaches suffer from high computational costs due to convolutional neural networks or transformer-based architectures. Additionally, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies in visual representation and rely on static loss functions that fail to align local and global features effectively. To address these challenges, we propose ConMamba, a novel SSL framework specially designed for PDD. ConMamba integrates the Vision Mamba Encoder (VME), which employs a bidirectional State Space Model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-level contrastive loss with dynamic weight adjustment to optimize local-global feature alignment. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics. This provides an efficient and robust solution for PDD.

  Despite substantial progress in video understanding, most existing datasets are limited to Earth's gravitational conditions. However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity.

  Compound figures, which are multi-panel composites containing diverse subfigures, are ubiquitous in biomedical literature, yet large-scale subfigure extraction remains largely unaddressed. Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability, leaving a critical open question: How does high-fidelity image-text alignment via large-scale subfigure extraction impact representation learning in vision-language models? We address this gap by introducing a scalable subfigure extraction pipeline based on transformer-based object detection, trained on a synthetic corpus of 500,000 compound figures, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both ImageCLEF 2016 and synthetic benchmarks. Using this pipeline, we release OPEN-PMC-18M, a large-scale high quality biomedical vision-language dataset comprising 18 million clinically relevant subfigure-caption pairs spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train and evaluate vision-language models on our curated datasets and show improved performance across retrieval, zero-shot classification, and robustness benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.

  Micro-expression recognition (MER) demands models that can amplify millisecond-level, low-amplitude facial motions while suppressing identity-specific appearance. We introduce FaceSleuth, a dual-stream architecture that (1) enhances motion along the empirically dominant vertical axix through a Continuously Vertical Attention (CVA) block, (2) localises the resulting signals with a Facial Position Focalizer built on hierarchical cross-window attention, and (3) steers feature learning toward physiologically meaningful regions via lightweight Action-Unit embeddings. To examine whether the hand-chosen vertical axis is indeed optimal, we further propose a Single-Orientation Attention (SOA) module that learns its own pooling direction end-to-end. SOA is differentiable, adds only 0.16 % parameters, and collapses to CVA when the learned angle converges to {\Pi}/2. In practice, SOA reliably drifts to 88¬∞, confirming the effectiveness of the vertical prior while delivering consistent gains. On three standard MER benchmarks, FaceSleuth with CVA already surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods; plugging in SOA lifts accuracy and F1 score performance to 95.1 % / 0.918 on CASME II, 87.1 % / 0.840 on SAMM, and 92.9 % / 0.917 on MMEW without sacrificing model compactness. These results establish a new state of the art and, for the first time, provide empirical evidence that the vertical attention bias is the most discriminative orientation for MER.

  We introduce a new task, Map and Locate, which unifies the traditionally distinct objectives of open-vocabulary segmentation - detecting and segmenting object instances based on natural language queries - and 3D reconstruction, the process of estimating a scene's 3D structure from visual inputs. Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.

  Object orientation understanding represents a fundamental challenge in visual perception critical for applications like robotic manipulation and augmented reality. Current vision-language benchmarks fail to isolate this capability, often conflating it with positional relationships and general scene understanding. We introduce DORI (Discriminative Orientation Reasoning Intelligence), a comprehensive benchmark establishing object orientation perception as a primary evaluation target. DORI assesses four dimensions of orientation comprehension: frontal alignment, rotational transformations, relative directional relationships, and canonical orientation understanding. Through carefully curated tasks from 11 datasets spanning 67 object categories across synthetic and real-world scenarios, DORI provides insights on how multi-modal systems understand object orientations. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art vision-language models reveals critical limitations: even the best models achieve only 54.2% accuracy on coarse tasks and 33.0% on granular orientation judgments, with performance deteriorating for tasks requiring reference frame shifts or compound rotations. These findings demonstrate the need for dedicated orientation representation mechanisms, as models show systematic inability to perform precise angular estimations, track orientation changes across viewpoints, and understand compound rotations - suggesting limitations in their internal 3D spatial representations. As the first diagnostic framework specifically designed for orientation awareness in multimodal systems, DORI offers implications for improving robotic control, 3D scene reconstruction, and human-AI interaction in physical environments.

  We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a major leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2 introduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies, thereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated reasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training efficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which effectively addresses the vanishing advantages dilemma inherent in GRPO by prioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably, we observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual hallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through calibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results affirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances such as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and 73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing open-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the performance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI-o4-mini.

  Counterfactual reasoning is crucial for robust video understanding but remains underexplored in existing multimodal benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{COVER} (\textbf{\underline{CO}}unterfactual \textbf{\underline{V}}id\textbf{\underline{E}}o \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning), a multidimensional multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across the abstract-concrete and perception-cognition dimensions. Beyond prior multimodal benchmarks, COVER decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions, enabling fine-grained reasoning analysis. Experiments on commercial and open-source models reveal a strong correlation between sub-question accuracy and counterfactual reasoning performance, highlighting the role of structured inference in video understanding. Furthermore, our results suggest a key insight: enhancing the reasoning capability of models is essential for improving the robustness of video understanding. COVER establishes a new standard for assessing MLLMs' logical reasoning abilities in dynamic environments. Our work is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancing of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred interest in complex multimodal reasoning tasks in the real-world and virtual environment, which require coordinating multiple abilities, including visual perception, visual reasoning, spatial awareness, and target deduction. However, existing evaluations primarily assess the final task completion, often degrading assessments to isolated abilities such as visual grounding and visual question answering. Less attention is given to comprehensively and quantitatively analyzing reasoning process in multimodal environments, which is crucial for understanding model behaviors and underlying reasoning mechanisms beyond merely task success. To address this, we introduce MM-Escape, an extensible benchmark for investigating multimodal reasoning, inspired by real-world escape games. MM-Escape emphasizes intermediate model behaviors alongside final task completion. To achieve this, we develop EscapeCraft, a customizable and open environment that enables models to engage in free-form exploration for assessing multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments show that MLLMs, regardless of scale, can successfully complete the simplest room escape tasks, with some exhibiting human-like exploration strategies. Yet, performance dramatically drops as task difficulty increases. Moreover, we observe that performance bottlenecks vary across models, revealing distinct failure modes and limitations in their multimodal reasoning abilities, such as repetitive trajectories without adaptive exploration, getting stuck in corners due to poor visual spatial awareness, and ineffective use of acquired props, such as the key. We hope our work sheds light on new challenges in multimodal reasoning, and uncovers potential improvements in MLLMs capabilities.

  Domain generalization (DG) for object detection aims to enhance detectors' performance in unseen scenarios. This task remains challenging due to complex variations in real-world applications. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diverse scene generation, which inspires us to explore their potential for improving DG tasks. Instead of generating images, our method extracts multi-step intermediate features during the diffusion process to obtain domain-invariant features for generalized detection. Furthermore, we propose an efficient knowledge transfer framework that enables detectors to inherit the generalization capabilities of diffusion models through feature and object-level alignment, without increasing inference time. We conduct extensive experiments on six challenging DG benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements of 14.0% mAP over existing DG approaches across different domains and corruption types. Notably, our method even outperforms most domain adaptation methods without accessing any target domain data. Moreover, the diffusion-guided detectors show consistent improvements of 15.9% mAP on average compared to the baseline. Our work aims to present an effective approach for domain-generalized detection and provide potential insights for robust visual recognition in real-world scenarios.

Besides, our framework features a structured multi-round evaluation process, generating and analyzing intermediate image descriptions to provide deeper insight into these three aspects. By aligning model outputs more closely with human judgment, M3-AGIQA delivers robust and interpretable quality scores.

  We introduce a highly multimodal transformer to represent many remote sensing modalities - multispectral optical, synthetic aperture radar, elevation, weather, pseudo-labels, and more - across space and time. These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and fast) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and slow). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively researched for large language models in downstream tasks. Among all the existing approaches, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for its streamlined design by incorporating low-rank matrices into existing pre-trained models. Though effective, LoRA, as well as its adaptive optimizations, either allocate the same matrix to all the modules or adjust the interior rank of the components based on importance scoring indicators. In this paper, we argue that not all the modules in LLMs are suitable and necessary to be fine-tuned. Enlightened by this insight, we propose a new PEFT scheme called DiffoRA, which enables adaptive adoption of the low-rank decomposition matrices. At the core of DiffoRA lies a Differential Adaptation Matrix (DAM) to determine which module is the most suitable and essential for fine-tuning. We theoretically explain how the designed matrix impacts the convergence rate and generalization capability of a pre-trained model. We then construct the DAM via continuous relaxation and discretization with weight-sharing optimizations. We fully implement DiffoRA and design comprehensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that DiffoRA delivers state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

  We address the problem of gaze target estimation, which aims to predict where a person is looking in a scene. Predicting a person's gaze target requires reasoning both about the person's appearance and the contents of the scene. Prior works have developed increasingly complex, hand-crafted pipelines for gaze target estimation that carefully fuse features from separate scene encoders, head encoders, and auxiliary models for signals like depth and pose. Motivated by the success of general-purpose feature extractors on a variety of visual tasks, we propose Gaze-LLE, a novel transformer framework that streamlines gaze target estimation by leveraging features from a frozen DINOv2 encoder. We extract a single feature representation for the scene, and apply a person-specific positional prompt to decode gaze with a lightweight module. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several gaze benchmarks and provide extensive analysis to validate our design choices. Our code is available at:this http URL.

  Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models have propelled the development of joint probabilistic models capable of both image understanding and generation. However, we have identified that recent methods suffer from loss of image information during understanding task, due to either image discretization or diffusion denoising steps. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Auto-Regressive (MMAR) probabilistic modeling framework. Unlike discretization line of method, MMAR takes in continuous-valued image tokens to avoid information loss in an efficient way. Differing from diffusion-based approaches, we disentangle the diffusion process from auto-regressive backbone model by employing a light-weight diffusion head on top each auto-regressed image patch embedding. In this way, when the model transits from image generation to understanding through text generation, the backbone model's hidden representation of the image is not limited to the last denoising step. To successfully train our method, we also propose a theoretically proven technique that addresses the numerical stability issue and a training strategy that balances the generation and understanding task goals. Extensive evaluations on 18 image understanding benchmarks show that MMAR significantly outperforms most of the existing joint multi-modal models, surpassing the method that employs pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. Meanwhile, MMAR is able to generate high quality images. We also show that our method is scalable with larger data and model size.

  Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context lengththis http URL, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

  We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute. Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.

  Social reasoning abilities are crucial for AI systems to effectively interpret and respond to multimodal human communication and interaction within social contexts. We introduce SOCIAL GENOME, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. SOCIAL GENOME contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). SOCIAL GENOME is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. SOCIAL GENOME computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of SOCIAL GENOME through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models.

  Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on basic abilities using nonverbal methods, such as yes-no and multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing AlignMMBench, which provides more nuanced evaluations of alignment capabilities and is the first benchmark specifically designed for Chinese visual contexts. This benchmark is meticulously curated from real-world scenarios and internet sources, encompassing thirteen specific tasks across three categories, and includes both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Incorporating a prompt rewrite strategy, AlignMMBench encompasses 1,054 images and 4,978 question-answer pairs. To facilitate the evaluation pipeline, we develop CritiqueVLM, a rule-calibrated evaluator that exceeds GPT-4's evaluation ability. Additionally, we measure the "alignment score", a quantitative metric designed to assess the robustness and stability of models across diverse prompts. Finally, we evaluate the performance of representative VLMs on AlignMMBench, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of different VLM architectures.

  We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

  Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.

  Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is key to improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). We show that mutual biases--when both UQ methods and correctness functions are biased by the same factors--systematically distort evaluation. First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets x 4 models x 8 UQ methods. Our analysis shows that length biases in correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LM-as-a-judge methods as the least length-biased, offering a promising path for a fairer UQ evaluation.

  Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.

  Recent advances in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their quadratic computational complexity concerning sequence length remains a significant bottleneck for processing long documents. As a result, many efforts like sparse attention and state space models have been proposed to improve the efficiency of LLMs over long sequences. Though effective, these approaches compromise the performance or introduce structural complexity. This calls for a simple yet efficient model that preserves the fundamental Transformer architecture. To this end, we introduce SWAT, which enables efficient long-context handling via Sliding Window Attention Training. This paper first attributes the inefficiency of Transformers to the attention sink phenomenon resulting from the high variance of softmax operation. Then, we replace softmax with the sigmoid function and utilize a balanced ALiBi and Rotary Position Embedding for efficient information compression and retention. Experiments demonstrate that SWAT achieves SOTA performance compared with state-of-the-art linear recurrent architectures on eight benchmarks. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration highlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in achieving exceptional math performance.

  Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models. This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models (LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to set new standards in knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks, yet their high computational demands limit widespread adoption. While distilling large models into smaller ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques--such as static knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human feedback, or limited self-reflection--struggle to yield substantial and lasting performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&R) framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis, corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves smaller-model accuracy, robustness, and generalization, outperforming conventional baselines by a large margin.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.

  The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation, a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive linguistic robustness evaluation across diverse English varieties. Each construction of Trans-EnV was validated through rigorous statistical testing and consultation with a researcher in the field of second language acquisition, ensuring its linguistic validity.

  In this paper, we show that knowledge distillation can be subverted to manipulate language model benchmark scores, revealing a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices. We introduce "Data Laundering," a process that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps. Through extensive experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model, we show how this approach can achieve substantial improvements in benchmark accuracy (up to 75\% on GPQA) without developing genuine reasoning capabilities. Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about evaluation integrity in AI development and the need for benchmarks that more accurately reflect true model capabilities.

  Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.

  Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.

  Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across tasks but incur substantial computational costs due to their deep, multi-layered architectures. Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these inefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical dynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level heterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical dynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers necessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a dynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource allocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to prioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and self-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a two-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that learns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning decisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore performance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the performance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing dynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical deployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs). While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs, robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models (LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies: generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4 achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems, underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and relevant responses in clinical contexts.

  The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various benchmarks and hyperparameter settings. Code:this https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, yet post-training is constrained by inefficient sample utilization and inflexible difficulty samples processing. To address these limitations, we propose Customized Curriculum Learning (CCL), a novel framework with two key innovations. First, we introduce model-adaptive difficulty definition that customizes curriculum datasets based on each model's individual capabilities rather than using predefined difficulty metrics. Second, we develop "Guided Prompting," which dynamically reduces sample difficulty through strategic hints, enabling effective utilization of challenging samples that would otherwise degrade performance. Comprehensive experiments on supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CCL significantly outperforms uniform training approaches across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness across both paradigms in enhancing sample utilization and model performance.

  Temporal reasoning in legal texts is important for applications like case law analysis and compliance monitoring. However, existing datasets lack expert language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs manage event ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512 instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal event ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge. We investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal language features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific modeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.

  With the rise of long-context language models (LMs) capable of processing tens of thousands of tokens in a single pass, do multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines still offer measurable benefits over simpler, single-stage approaches? To assess this question, we conduct a controlled evaluation for QA tasks under systematically scaled token budgets, comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three baselines, including DOS RAG (Document's Original Structure RAG), a simple retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order. Despite its straightforward design, DOS RAG consistently matches or outperforms more intricate methods on multiple long-context QA benchmarks. We recommend establishing DOS RAG as a simple yet strong baseline for future RAG evaluations, pairing it with emerging embedding and language models to assess trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness as model capabilities evolve.

  The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents. Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually scale with more web corpora.

  LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing. However, they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and domain-specific reasoning are crucial. Existing TableQA benchmarks are often limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage. Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications. To address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks. Specifically, TableEval includes tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia, and industry reports). Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents. Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level. Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human judgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA tasks, offering insights for future improvements. We make our dataset available here:this https URL.

  _Mohammadamin Shafiei, Hamidreza Saffari, Nafise Sadat Moosavi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias: logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or ``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of 300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering, systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt. Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies: free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities, highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in LLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000 meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hate speech detection is key to online content moderation, but current models struggle to generalise beyond their training data. This has been linked to dataset biases and the use of sentence-level labels, which fail to teach models the underlying structure of hate speech. In this work, we show that even when models are trained with more fine-grained, span-level annotations (e.g., "artists" is labeled as target and "are parasites" as dehumanising comparison), they struggle to disentangle the meaning of these labels from the surrounding context. As a result, combinations of expressions that deviate from those seen during training remain particularly difficult for models to detect. We investigate whether training on a dataset where expressions occur with equal frequency across all contexts can improve generalisation. To this end, we create U-PLEAD, a dataset of ~364,000 synthetic posts, along with a novel compositional generalisation benchmark of ~8,000 manually validated posts. Training on a combination of U-PLEAD and real data improves compositional generalisation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on the human-sourced PLEAD.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such as hallucination and outdated knowledge.However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in real-world scenarios.Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining reliable robustness assessment.In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios.Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating "magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but covertly mislead RAG systems.Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer pairs.More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups.We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment.Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise distributions.Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in real-world applications.The Magic Mushroom benchmark is available at thethis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models increasingly support multiple languages, yet most benchmarks for gender bias remain English-centric. We introduce EuroGEST, a dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in LLMs across English and 29 European languages. EuroGEST builds on an existing expert-informed benchmark covering 16 gender stereotypes, expanded in this work using translation tools, quality estimation metrics, and morphological heuristics. Human evaluations confirm that our data generation method results in high accuracy of both translations and gender labels across languages. We use EuroGEST to evaluate 24 multilingual language models from six model families, demonstrating that the strongest stereotypes in all models across all languages are that women are \textit{beautiful,} \textit{empathetic} and \textit{neat} and men are \textit{leaders}, \textit{strong, tough} and \textit{professional}. We also show that larger models encode gendered stereotypes more strongly and that instruction finetuning does not consistently reduce gendered stereotypes. Our work highlights the need for more multilingual studies of fairness in LLMs and offers scalable methods and resources to audit gender bias across languages.

  High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is pivotal in cryptocurrency markets, demanding rapid decision-making. Social media platforms like Reddit offer valuable, yet underexplored, information for such high-frequency, short-term trading. This paper introduces \textbf{PulseReddit}, a novel dataset that is the first to align large-scale Reddit discussion data with high-frequency cryptocurrency market statistics for short-term trading analysis. We conduct an extensive empirical study using Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to investigate the impact of social sentiment from PulseReddit on trading performance. Our experiments conclude that MAS augmented with PulseReddit data achieve superior trading outcomes compared to traditional baselines, particularly in bull markets, and demonstrate robust adaptability across different market regimes. Furthermore, our research provides conclusive insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different LLMs, detailing significant considerations for practical model selection in HFT applications. PulseReddit and our findings establish a foundation for advanced MAS research in HFT, demonstrating the tangible benefits of integrating social media.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.

  As interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for interactive and emotionally rich experiences grows, virtual pet companionship emerges as a novel yet underexplored application. Existing approaches focus on basic pet role-playing interactions without systematically benchmarking LLMs for comprehensive companionship. In this paper, we introduce Pet-Bench, a dedicated benchmark that evaluates LLMs across both self-interaction and human-interaction dimensions. Unlike prior work, Pet-Bench emphasizes self-evolution and developmental behaviors alongside interactive engagement, offering a more realistic reflection of pet companionship. It features diverse tasks such as intelligent scheduling, memory-based dialogues, and psychological conversations, with over 7,500 interaction instances designed to simulate complex pet behaviors. Evaluation of 28 LLMs reveals significant performance variations linked to model size and inherent capabilities, underscoring the need for specialized optimization in this domain. Pet-Bench serves as a foundational resource for benchmarking pet-related LLM abilities and advancing emotionally immersive human-pet interactions.

  The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands. However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose $\gamma$-PO, a dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin calibration, $\gamma$-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from ambiguous pairs. Moreover, $\gamma$-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs. Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, $\gamma$-PO achieves an average 4.4\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, $\gamma$-PO requires minimal code changes and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust solution for enhancing LLMs alignment.

  Trustworthiness in healthcare question-answering (QA) systems is important for ensuring patient safety, clinical effectiveness, and user confidence. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into medical settings, the reliability of their responses directly influences clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. However, achieving comprehensive trustworthiness in medical QA poses significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of healthcare data, the critical nature of clinical scenarios, and the multifaceted dimensions of trustworthy AI. In this survey, we systematically examine six key dimensions of trustworthiness in medical QA, i.e., Factuality, Robustness, Fairness, Safety, Explainability, and Calibration. We review how each dimension is evaluated in existing LLM-based medical QA systems. We compile and compare major benchmarks designed to assess these dimensions and analyze evaluation-guided techniques that drive model improvements, such as retrieval-augmented grounding, adversarial fine-tuning, and safety alignment. Finally, we identify open challenges-such as scalable expert evaluation, integrated multi-dimensional metrics, and real-world deployment studies-and propose future research directions to advance the safe, reliable, and transparent deployment of LLM-powered medical QA.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong language understanding and generation abilities across various languages, their cultural knowledge is often limited to English-speaking communities, which can marginalize the cultures of non-English communities. To address the problem, evaluation of the cultural awareness of the LLMs and the methods to develop culturally aware LLMs have been investigated. In this study, we focus on evaluating knowledge of folktales, a key medium for conveying and circulating culture. In particular, we focus on Japanese folktales, specifically on knowledge of Yokai. Yokai are supernatural creatures originating from Japanese folktales that continue to be popular motifs in art and entertainment today. Yokai have long served as a medium for cultural expression, making them an ideal subject for assessing the cultural awareness of LLMs. We introduce YokaiEval, a benchmark dataset consisting of 809 multiple-choice questions (each with four options) designed to probe knowledge about yokai. We evaluate the performance of 31 Japanese and multilingual LLMs on this dataset. The results show that models trained with Japanese language resources achieve higher accuracy than English-centric models, with those that underwent continued pretraining in Japanese, particularly those based on Llama-3, performing especially well. The code and dataset are available atthis https URLILab/YokaiEval.

  Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation time. We plan to publish our benchmark adaptions.

  Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in addressing diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance is often limited by inherent comprehension of problems. To address this limitation, we propose Exchange-of-Perspective (EoP), a novel framework designed to exchange perspectives across different definitions of problem, so that it can break the fixed mindset from any particular formulation of the question. We conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on 8 benchmarks. The results show that EoP can significantly improve performance. For instance, compared to the non-commutative baseline PHP, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and EoP, we observe a 3.6% improvement on AQuA (60.6% to 64.2%), while GPT-4-powered EoP demonstrates a 7.7% overall accuracy enhancement on Math (53.9% to 61.6%) and a 3.5% improvement on OlympiadBench Maths (43.5% to 47.0%) when using Qwen-2.5-72b.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated that Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing model performance. However, training PRMs typically requires step-level labels, either manually annotated or automatically generated, which can be costly and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this challenge, we introduce FreePRM, a weakly supervised framework for training PRMs without access to ground-truth step-level labels. FreePRM first generates pseudo step-level labels based on the correctness of final outcome, and then employs Buffer Probability to eliminate impact of noise inherent in pseudo labeling. Experimental results show that FreePRM achieves an average F1 score of 53.0% on ProcessBench, outperforming fully supervised PRM trained on Math-Shepherd by +24.1%. Compared to other open-source PRMs, FreePRM outperforms upon RLHFlow-PRM-Mistral-8B (28.4%) by +24.6%, EurusPRM (31.3%) by +21.7%, and Skywork-PRM-7B (42.1%) by +10.9%. This work introduces a new paradigm in PRM training, significantly reducing reliance on costly step-level annotations while maintaining strong performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current instruction data synthesis methods primarily focus on single-turn instructions and often neglect cross-turn coherence, resulting in context drift and reduced task completion rates in extended conversations. To address this limitation, we propose Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, a framework that constrains multi-turn instruction synthesis by explicitly modeling human conversational intent. It operates in two stages: (1) Intent Modeling, which captures the global structure of human dialogues by assigning each conversation to one of nine well-defined intent trajectories, ensuring a coherent and goal-oriented information flow; and (2) Skeleton Generation, which constructs a structurally grounded sequence of user queries aligned with the modeled intent, thereby serving as a scaffold that constrains and guides the downstream instruction synthesis process. Based on this process, we construct ConsistentChat, a multi-turn instruction dataset with approximately 15,000 multi-turn conversations and 224,392 utterances. Experiments on the Light, Topdial, and MT-Eval benchmarks show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat achieve a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in task success rate, significantly outperforming models trained on existing single-turn and multi-turn instruction datasets.

  One of the fundamental problems in digital agents is their lack of understanding of their environment.

To address this, we propose Go-Browse, a method for automatically collecting diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured exploration of web environments. Go-Browse achieves efficient exploration by framing data collection as a graph search, enabling reuse of information across exploration episodes. We instantiate our method on the WebArena benchmark, collecting a dataset of 10K successful task-solving trajectories and 40K interaction steps across 100 URLs. Fine-tuning a 7B parameter language model on this dataset achieves a success rate of 21.7% on the WebArena benchmark, beating GPT-4o mini by 2.4% and exceeding current state-of-the-art results for sub-10B parameter models by 2.9%.

  How can we accelerate large language models(LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy? The slow inference speed of LLMs hinders us to benefit from their remarkable performance in diverse applications. This is mainly because numerous sublayers are stacked together in LLMs. Sublayer pruning compresses and expedites LLMs via removing unnecessary sublayers. However, existing sublayer pruning algorithms are limited in accuracy since they naively select sublayers to prune, overlooking the different characteristics of each sublayer. In this paper, we propose SPRINT (Sublayer PRuning wIth LateNcy and Tunability Information), an accurate sublayer pruning method for LLMs. SPRINT accurately selects a target sublayer to prune by considering 1) the amount of latency reduction after pruning and 2) the tunability of sublayers. SPRINT iteratively prunes redundant sublayers and swiftly tunes the parameters of remaining sublayers. Experiments show that SPRINT achieves the best accuracy-speedup trade-off, exhibiting up to 23.88%p higher accuracy on zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks compared to existing pruning algorithms.

  Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities. Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT (Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data (bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3 models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's broader applicability.

  This study presents an approach that uses large language models such as GPT-4 to generate usage policies in the W3C Open Digital Rights Language ODRL automatically from natural language instructions. Our approach uses the ODRL ontology and its documentation as a central part of the prompt. Our research hypothesis is that a curated version of existing ontology documentation will better guide policy generation. We present various heuristics for adapting the ODRL ontology and its documentation to guide an end-to-end KG construction process. We evaluate our approach in the context of dataspaces, i.e., distributed infrastructures for trustworthy data exchange between multiple participating organizations for the cultural domain. We created a benchmark consisting of 12 use cases of varying complexity. Our evaluation shows excellent results with up to 91.95% accuracy in the resulting knowledge graph.

  We introduce FailureSensorIQ, a novel Multi-Choice Question-Answering (MCQA) benchmarking system designed to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason and understand complex, domain-specific scenarios in Industry 4.0. Unlike traditional QA benchmarks, our system focuses on multiple aspects of reasoning through failure modes, sensor data, and the relationships between them across various industrial assets. Through this work, we envision a paradigm shift where modeling decisions are not only data-driven using statistical tools like correlation analysis and significance tests, but also domain-driven by specialized LLMs which can reason about the key contributors and useful patterns that can be captured with feature engineering. We evaluate the Industrial knowledge of over a dozen LLMs-including GPT-4, Llama, and Mistral-on FailureSensorIQ from different lens using Perturbation-Uncertainty-Complexity analysis, Expert Evaluation study, Asset-Specific Knowledge Gap analysis, ReAct agent using external knowledge-bases. Even though closed-source models with strong reasoning capabilities approach expert-level performance, the comprehensive benchmark reveals a significant drop in performance that is fragile to perturbations, distractions, and inherent knowledge gaps in the models. We also provide a real-world case study of how LLMs can drive the modeling decisions on 3 different failure prediction datasets related to various assets. We release: (a) expert-curated MCQA for various industrial assets, (b) FailureSensorIQ benchmark and Hugging Face leaderboard based on MCQA built from non-textual data found in ISO documents, and (c) LLMFeatureSelector, an LLM-based feature selection scikit-learn pipeline.

  Instruction fine-tuning is crucial in NLP tasks, enhancing pretrained models' instruction-following capabilities and task-specific performance. However, obtaining high-quality fine-tuning data for large models is challenging due to data collection difficulties and high production costs. To address this, we propose MASTER, a novel data augmentation method that enriches original data through interactions among multiple agents with varying cognitive levels. We simulate three pedagogically grounded teaching scenarios, leveraging multi-agent conversations to generate high-quality teacher-student interaction data. Utilizing MASTER, we construct BOOST-QA, a fine-tuning dataset augmented from existing datasets like Orca-Math-200k, ProcQA, and OpenHermes2.5. Experiments show that models fine-tuned with BOOST-QA perform excellently across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong multitask generalization. Notably, MASTER significantly improves models' reasoning abilities in complex tasks, providing valuable insights for future research.

  As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

  Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss, logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate (FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets, covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Steerability, or the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt outputs to align with diverse community-specific norms, perspectives, and communication styles, is critical for real-world applications but remains under-evaluated. We introduce Steer-Bench, a benchmark for assessing population-specific steering using contrasting Reddit communities. Covering 30 contrasting subreddit pairs across 19 domains, Steer-Bench includes over 10,000 instruction-response pairs and validated 5,500 multiple-choice question with corresponding silver labels to test alignment with diverse community norms. Our evaluation of 13 popular LLMs using Steer-Bench reveals that while human experts achieve an accuracy of 81% with silver labels, the best-performing models reach only around 65% accuracy depending on the domain and configuration. Some models lag behind human-level alignment by over 15 percentage points, highlighting significant gaps in community-sensitive steerability. Steer-Bench is a benchmark to systematically assess how effectively LLMs understand community-specific instructions, their resilience to adversarial steering attempts, and their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural and ideological perspectives.

  LLM-as-a-Judge employs large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to evaluate the quality of LLM-generated responses, gaining popularity for its cost-effectiveness and strong alignment with human evaluations. However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity. T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead by up to 25.2\%.

  As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses these gaps. Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy, we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach substantially improves their safety performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.

  Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) provides insight into cultural and social dynamics. Yet, the validity of methods for measuring different kinds of LSC remains unestablished due to the absence of historical benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we propose LSC-Eval, a novel three-stage general-purpose evaluation framework to: (1) develop a scalable methodology for generating synthetic datasets that simulate theory-driven LSC using In-Context Learning and a lexical database; (2) use these datasets to evaluate the sensitivity of computational methods to synthetic change; and (3) assess their suitability for detecting change in specific dimensions and domains. We apply LSC-Eval to simulate changes along the Sentiment, Intensity, and Breadth (SIB) dimensions, as defined in the SIBling framework, using examples from psychology. We then evaluate the ability of selected methods to detect these controlled interventions. Our findings validate the use of synthetic benchmarks, demonstrate that tailored methods effectively detect changes along SIB dimensions, and reveal that a state-of-the-art LSC model faces challenges in detecting affective dimensions of LSC. LSC-Eval offers a valuable tool for dimension- and domain-specific benchmarking of LSC methods, with particular relevance to the social sciences.

  Recent work found that LLMs are sensitive to a wide range of arbitrary prompt dimensions, including the type of delimiters, answer enumerators, instruction wording, and more. This throws into question popular single-prompt evaluation practices. We present DOVE (Dataset Of Variation Evaluation) a large-scale dataset containing prompt perturbations of various evaluation benchmarks. In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a community-wide effort toward meaningful, robust, and efficient evaluation.Browse the data, contribute, and more:this https URL

  Africa's rich linguistic heritage remains underrepresented in NLP, largely due to historical policies that favor foreign languages and create significant data inequities. In this paper, we integrate theoretical insights on Africa's language landscape with an empirical evaluation using Sahara - a comprehensive benchmark curated from large-scale, publicly accessible datasets capturing the continent's linguistic diversity. By systematically assessing the performance of leading large language models (LLMs) on Sahara, we demonstrate how policy-induced data variations directly impact model effectiveness across African languages. Our findings reveal that while a few languages perform reasonably well, many Indigenous languages remain marginalized due to sparse data. Leveraging these insights, we offer actionable recommendations for policy reforms and inclusive data practices. Overall, our work underscores the urgent need for a dual approach - combining theoretical understanding with empirical evaluation - to foster linguistic diversity in AI for African communities.

  Sentence embedding is essential for many NLP tasks, with contrastive learning methods achieving strong performance using annotated datasets like NLI. Yet, the reliance on manual labels limits scalability. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sentence pairs, reducing annotation dependency. However, they overlook ranking information crucial for fine-grained semantic distinctions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for controlling the generation direction of LLMs in the latent space. Unlike unconstrained generation, the controlled approach ensures meaningful semantic divergence. Then, we refine exist sentence embedding model by integrating ranking information and semantic information. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new SOTA performance with a modest cost in ranking sentence synthesis.

  We present ReFoRCE, a Text-to-SQL agent that tops the Spider 2.0 leaderboard--a challenging benchmark reflecting complex, real-world Text-to-SQL scenarios. While Text-to-SQL systems enable natural language queries over structured databases, deploying them in enterprise environments remains difficult due to large, complex schemas (with over 1,000 columns), diverse SQL dialects (e.g., BigQuery, Snowflake), and sophisticated query requirements (e.g., transformations and analytics). ReFoRCE addresses these challenges through: (a) database information compression via pattern-based table grouping and LLM-guided schema linking to alleviate long-context issues; (b) self-refinement to iteratively correct syntax and semantic errors across dialects; (c) majority-vote consensus to select high-confidence candidates while deferring ambiguous cases arising from sophisticated queries; and (d) iterative column exploration guided by execution feedback to resolve those deferred cases. ReFoRCE achieves new state-of-the-art results, with scores of 35.83 on Spider 2.0-Snow and 36.56 on Spider 2.0-Lite.

  Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world, open-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these limitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and compose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that this framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods that rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and recover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to unforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found inthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent progress in systematic evaluation frameworks, benchmarking the uncertainty of large language models (LLMs) remains a highly challenging task. Existing methods for benchmarking the uncertainty of LLMs face three key challenges: the need for internal model access, additional training, or high computational costs. This is particularly unfavorable for closed-source models. To this end, we introduce UBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the uncertainty of LLMs. Unlike other benchmarks, UBench is based on confidence intervals. It encompasses 11,978 multiple-choice questions spanning knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Based on this, we conduct extensive experiments. This includes comparisons with other advanced uncertainty estimation methods, the assessment of the uncertainty of 20 LLMs, and an exploration of the effects of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, role-playing (RP) prompts, and temperature on model uncertainty. Our analysis reveals several crucial insights: 1) Our confidence interval-based methods are highly effective for uncertainty quantification; 2) Regarding uncertainty, outstanding open-source models show competitive performance versus closed-source models; 3) CoT and RP prompts present potential ways to improve model reliability, while the influence of temperature changes follows no universal rule.

  AI for Industrial Asset Lifecycle Management aims to automate complex operational workflows -- such as condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and intervention scheduling -- to reduce human workload and minimize system downtime. Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in isolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In contrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) introduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across the entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents autonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and manual coordination. To this end, we introduce AssetOpsBench -- a unified framework and environment designed to guide the development, orchestration, and evaluation of domain-specific agents tailored for Industry 4.0 applications. We outline the key requirements for such holistic systems and provide actionable insights into building agents that integrate perception, reasoning, and control for real-world industrial operations.

  Early-stage startup investment is a high-risk endeavor characterized by scarce data and uncertain outcomes. Traditional machine learning approaches often require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain opaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper, we propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework powered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded directly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning patterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively refine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines few-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update its decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal supervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup success far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more precise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x more precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital (VC) firms.

  This work presents a first evaluation of two state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek R1, on analogical reasoning, focusing on well-established nonverbal human IQ tests based on Raven's progressive matrices. We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these symbolic analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles, and 2) we smoothen the distributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% -- approaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these out-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest accuracy reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

  The emergence of multimodal large models has advanced artificial intelligence, introducing unprecedented levels of performance and functionality. However, optimizing these models remains challenging due to historically isolated paths of model-centric and data-centric developments, leading to suboptimal outcomes and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present a new sandbox suite tailored for integrated data-model co-development. This sandbox provides a feedback-driven experimental platform, enabling cost-effective iteration and guided refinement of both data and models. Our proposed ``Probe-Analyze-Refine'' workflow, validated through practical use cases on multimodal tasks such as image-text pre-training with CLIP, image-to-text generation with LLaVA-like models, and text-to-video generation with DiT-based models, yields transferable and notable performance boosts, such as topping the VBench leaderboard. A comprehensive set of over 100 experiments demonstrated the suite's usability and extensibility, while also uncovering insights into the interplay between data quality, diversity, model behavior, and computational costs. All codes, datasets, and models are open-sourced to foster future research and applications that would otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated co-development infrastructure.

  IQ testing has served as a foundational methodology for evaluating human cognitive capabilities, deliberately decoupling assessment from linguistic background, language proficiency, or domain-specific knowledge to isolate core competencies in abstraction and reasoning. Yet, artificial intelligence research currently lacks systematic benchmarks to quantify these critical cognitive capabilities in multimodal systems. To address this crucial gap, we propose MM-IQ, a comprehensive evaluation framework, which comprises a large-scale training set with 4,776 visual reasoning problems and 2,710 meticulously curated test items spanning 8 distinct reasoning paradigms. Through systematic evaluation of existing open-source and proprietary multimodal models, our benchmark reveals striking limitations: even state-of-the-art architectures achieve only marginally superior performance to random chance (33.17% vs. 25% baseline accuracy). This substantial performance chasm highlights the inadequacy of current multimodal models in approximating fundamental human reasoning capacities, underscoring the need for paradigm-shifting advancements to bridge this cognitive divide. Moreover, inspired by the recent surge of large reasoning models, we also release a multimodal reasoning model as the baseline that is trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward functions, reaching competitive performance to the state-of-the-art with a notably smaller model size.

  Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

  Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.

  Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

  Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset atthis https URL.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 2%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 27.5% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available atthis https URL.

  Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.

  Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence. Current embedding methods often lack versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11 downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains. Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount (+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning. We open-source code and pretrained models at:this https URL.

  With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memes have emerged as a popular form of multimodal online communication, where their interpretation heavily depends on the specific context in which they appear. Current approaches predominantly focus on isolated meme analysis, either for harmful content detection or standalone interpretation, overlooking a fundamental challenge: the same meme can express different intents depending on its conversational context. This oversight creates an evaluation gap: although humans intuitively recognize how context shapes meme interpretation, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) can hardly understand context-dependent meme intent. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MemeReaCon, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate how LVLMs understand memes in their original context. We collected memes from five different Reddit communities, keeping each meme's image, the post text, and user comments together. We carefully labeled how the text and meme work together, what the poster intended, how the meme is structured, and how the community responded. Our tests with leading LVLMs show a clear weakness: models either fail to interpret critical information in the contexts, or overly focus on visual details while overlooking communicative purpose. MemeReaCon thus serves both as a diagnostic tool exposing current limitations and as a challenging benchmark to drive development toward more sophisticated LVLMs of the context-aware understanding.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Misinformation can be countered with fact-checking, but the process is costly and slow. Identifying checkworthy claims is the first step, where automation can help scale fact-checkers' efforts. However, detection methods struggle with content that is (1) multimodal, (2) from diverse domains, and (3) synthetic. We introduce HintsOfTruth, a public dataset for multimodal checkworthiness detection with 27K real-world and synthetic image/claim pairs. The mix of real and synthetic data makes this dataset unique and ideal for benchmarking detection methods. We compare fine-tuned and prompted Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that well-configured lightweight text-based encoders perform comparably to multimodal models but the former only focus on identifying non-claim-like content. Multimodal LLMs can be more accurate but come at a significant computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. When faced with synthetic data, multimodal models perform more robustly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With large language models (LLMs) increasingly deployed as cognitive engines for AI agents, the reliability and effectiveness critically hinge on their intrinsic epistemic agency, which remains understudied. Epistemic agency, the ability to flexibly construct, adapt, and monitor beliefs about dynamic environments, represents a base-model-level capacity independent of specific tools, modules, or applications. We characterize the holistic process underlying epistemic agency, which unfolds in seven interrelated dimensions: prediction, decision-making, perception, memory, counterfactual thinking, belief updating, and meta-reflection. Correspondingly, we propose Reflection-Bench, a cognitive-psychology-inspired benchmark consisting of seven tasks with long-term relevance and minimization of data leakage. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 16 models using three prompting strategies, we identify a clear three-tier performance hierarchy and significant limitations of current LLMs, particularly in meta-reflection capabilities. While state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate rudimentary signs of epistemic agency, our findings suggest several promising research directions, including enhancing core cognitive functions, improving cross-functional coordination, and developing adaptive processing mechanisms.

  Advances in large models, reinforcement learning, and open-endedness have accelerated progress toward autonomous agents that can learn and interact in the real world. To achieve this, flexible tools are needed to create rich, yet computationally efficient, environments. While scalable 2D environments fail to address key real-world challenges like 3D navigation and spatial reasoning, more complex 3D environments are computationally expensive and lack features like customizability and multi-agent support. This paper introduces Craftium, a highly customizable and easy-to-use platform for building rich 3D single- and multi-agent environments. We showcase environments of different complexity and nature: from single- and multi-agent tasks to vast worlds with many creatures and biomes, and customizable procedural task generators. Benchmarking shows that Craftium significantly reduces the computational cost of alternatives of similar richness, achieving +2K steps per second more than Minecraft-based frameworks.
