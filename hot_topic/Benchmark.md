  With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

  Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules, paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex real-world scenarios.

  World models allow autonomous agents to plan and explore by predicting the visual outcomes of different actions. However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse, real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning. MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms, highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos atthis https URL.

- **[Model Predictive Adversarial Imitation Learning for Planning from Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21533)**  `arXiv:2507.21533`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

- **[Online Concurrent Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10460)**  `arXiv:2403.10460`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI`  
  _Ratijit Mitra, Indranil Saha_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, centralized receding horizon online multi-robot coverage path planning algorithms have shown remarkable scalability in thoroughly exploring large, complex, unknown workspaces with many robots. In a horizon, the path planning and the path execution interleave, meaning when the path planning occurs for robots with no paths, the robots with outstanding paths do not execute, and subsequently, when the robots with new or outstanding paths execute to reach respective goals, path planning does not occur for those robots yet to get new paths, leading to wastage of both the robotic and the computation resources. As a remedy, we propose a centralized algorithm that is not horizon-based. It plans paths at any time for a subset of robots with no paths, i.e., who have reached their previously assigned goals, while the rest execute their outstanding paths, thereby enabling concurrent planning and execution. We formally prove that the proposed algorithm ensures complete coverage of an unknown workspace and analyze its time complexity. To demonstrate scalability, we evaluate our algorithm to cover eight large $2$D grid benchmark workspaces with up to 512 aerial and ground robots, respectively. A comparison with a state-of-the-art horizon-based algorithm shows its superiority in completing the coverage with up to 1.6x speedup. For validation, we perform ROS + Gazebo simulations in six 2D grid benchmark workspaces with 10 quadcopters and TurtleBots, respectively. We also successfully conducted one outdoor experiment with three quadcopters and one indoor with two TurtleBots.

- **[MP1: MeanFlow Tames Policy Learning in 1-step for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10543)**  `arXiv:2507.10543`  `cs.RO`  
  _Juyi Sheng, Ziyi Wang, Peiming Li, Mengyuan Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach. However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[ManiTaskGen: A Comprehensive Task Generator for Benchmarking and Improving Vision-Language Agents on Embodied Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20726)**  `arXiv:2505.20726`  `cs.RO`  
  _Liu Dai, Haina Wang, Weikang Wan, Hao Su_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building embodied agents capable of accomplishing arbitrary tasks is a core objective towards achieving embodied artificial general intelligence (E-AGI). While recent work has advanced such general robot policies, their training and evaluation are often limited to tasks within specific scenes, involving restricted instructions and scenarios. Existing benchmarks also typically rely on manual annotation of limited tasks in a few scenes. We argue that exploring the full spectrum of feasible tasks within any given scene is crucial, as they provide both extensive benchmarks for evaluation and valuable resources for agent improvement. Towards this end, we introduce ManiTaskGen, a novel system that automatically generates comprehensive, diverse, feasible mobile manipulation tasks for any given scene. The generated tasks encompass both process-based, specific instructions (e.g., "move object from X to Y") and outcome-based, abstract instructions (e.g., "clear the table"). We apply ManiTaskGen to both simulated and real-world scenes, demonstrating the validity and diversity of the generated tasks. We then leverage these tasks to automatically construct benchmarks, thoroughly evaluating the embodied decision-making capabilities of agents built upon existing vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method that utilizes ManiTaskGen tasks to enhance embodied decision-making. Overall, this work presents a universal task generation framework for arbitrary scenes, facilitating both benchmarking and improvement of embodied decision-making agents.

- **[MaPPO: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization with Prior Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21183)**  `arXiv:2507.21183`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Guangchen Lan, Sipeng Zhang, Tianle Wang, Yuwei Zhang, Daoan Zhang, Xinpeng Wei, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

- **[Foundation Models for Demand Forecasting via Dual-Strategy Ensembling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22053)**  `arXiv:2507.22053`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Wei Yang, Defu Cao, Yan Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category, department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE), which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting environments.

- **[Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning with Proxy Adversarial Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21738)**  `arXiv:2507.21738`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Huiqiang Chen, Tianqing Zhu, Xin Yu, Wanlei Zhou_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available (i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2) leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method over several baselines.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation, introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1) evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance, which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

- **[Uncovering Gradient Inversion Risks in Practical Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21198)**  `arXiv:2507.21198`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Xinguo Feng, Zhongkui Ma, Zihan Wang, Eu Joe Chegne, Mengyao Ma, Alsharif Abuadbba, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9% recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

- **[Embeddings to Diagnosis: Latent Fragility under Agentic Perturbations in Clinical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21188)**  `arXiv:2507.21188`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Raj Krishnan Vijayaraj_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding, despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

  _Ren Zhuang, Ben Wang, Shuifa Sun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the current training datasets. We propose structured interaction as a new scaling axis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of increasing model parameters. Our self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to 4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems as a vital frontier for capability emergence.

  _Prital Bamnodkar_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

  _Obumneme Nwafor, Mohammed Abdul Majeed Al Hooti_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation, Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce, with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions. Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI), which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical operational benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). SLA violations can impact efficiency and CSP profitability. In this work, we propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms. As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters, learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and SHAP-based interpretability.

  _Nguyen Xuan-Vu, Daniel Armstrong, Zlatko Joncev, Philippe Schwaller_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation, enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks, demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings. Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available atthis https URL.

- **[Latte: Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21494)**  `arXiv:2507.21494`  `cs.LG`  
  _Wenxuan Bao, Ruxi Deng, Ruizhong Qiu, Tianxin Wei, Hanghang Tong, Jingrui He_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.

  Handling incomplete and heterogeneous data remains a central challenge in real-world machine learning, where missing values may follow complex mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and features can be of mixed types (numerical and categorical). Existing methods often rely on imputation, which may introduce bias or privacy risks, or fail to jointly address data heterogeneity and structured missingness. We propose the \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{P}robability \textbf{M}ass \textbf{K}ernel (\textbf{HI-PMK}), a novel data-dependent representation learning approach that eliminates the need for imputation. HI-PMK introduces two key innovations: (1) a probability mass-based dissimilarity measure that adapts to local data distributions across heterogeneous features (numerical, ordinal, nominal), and (2) a missingness-aware uncertainty strategy (MaxU) that conservatively handles all three missingness mechanisms by assigning maximal plausible dissimilarity to unobserved entries. Our approach is privacy-preserving, scalable, and readily applicable to downstream tasks such as classification and clustering. Extensive experiments on over 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HI-PMK consistently outperforms traditional imputation-based pipelines and kernel methods across a wide range of missing data settings.

  Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics.

  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately. Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be released.

  Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

  The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon.

  Most current image captioning models typically generate captions from left-to-right. This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context but not future context. Though refinement-based models can exploit both past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner in the first stage and a captioner in the second stage), which can only be executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly. Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model to serve as a regularization for implicitly exploiting bidirectional context and optionally allowing explicit interaction of the bidirectional flows, while the final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on MSCOCO benchmark and find that the compact bidirectional architecture and the sentence-level ensemble play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of sentence-level ensemble is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new state-of-the-art results in comparison with non-vision-language-pretraining models. Finally, we verify the generality of this compact bidirectional architecture by extending it to LSTM backbone. Source code is available atthis https URL.

  Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF.

  Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

  Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning (MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

  Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks. Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our conjecture.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise. These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for practical applications.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models. However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm; 3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR) format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8% on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities.

  Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic, contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1 improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

  Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD. Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19 state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the efficacy of SMFNet as well.

  We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation, where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules, architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

  Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore, recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization, achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level (local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced reasoning over subtle facial musclethis http URLextensive evaluations on the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to 128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater scenarios.

  Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model (InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

  The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named \textbf{\tracker}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations. Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker} surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively.

  _Kejia Zhang, Keda Tao, Zhiming Luo, Chang Liu, Jiasheng Tang, Huan Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning, yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations. This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning. We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback, TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on several key metrics.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

  _Ming-Hui Liu, Harry Cheng, Xin Luo, Xin-Shun Xu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules. First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type. Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

  _Han Wu, Chong Wang, Zhiming Cui_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al \underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic \underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms, DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets, including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next, we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving 49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation, the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder. Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in both image quality and lighting accuracy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However, real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

  Most existing remote sensing instance segmentation approaches are designed for close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel categories or generalize across datasets. This restricts their applicability in diverse Earth observation scenarios. To address this, we introduce open-vocabulary (OV) learning for remote sensing instance segmentation. While current OV segmentation models perform well on natural image datasets, their direct application to remote sensing faces challenges such as diverse landscapes, seasonal variations, and the presence of small or ambiguous objects in aerial imagery. To overcome these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SCORE}$ ($\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{C}$ontext matters in $\textbf{O}$pen-vocabulary $\textbf{RE}$mote sensing instance segmentation), a framework that integrates multi-granularity scene context, i.e., regional context and global context, to enhance both visual and textual representations. Specifically, we introduce Region-Aware Integration, which refines class embeddings with regional context to improve object distinguishability. Additionally, we propose Global Context Adaptation, which enriches naive text embeddings with remote sensing global context, creating a more adaptable and expressive linguistic latent space for the classifier. We establish new benchmarks for OV remote sensing instance segmentation across diverse datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, our proposed method achieves SOTA performance, which provides a robust solution for large-scale, real-world geospatial analysis.

  With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.

  CLIP has shown promising performance across many short-text tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, limited by the input length of the text encoder, CLIP struggles on under-stream tasks with long-text inputs ($>77$ tokens). To remedy this issue, we propose FIX-CLIP, which includes three novel modules: (1) A dual-branch training pipeline that aligns short and long texts with masked and raw images, respectively, which boosts the long-text representation while preserving the short-text ability. (2) Multiple learnable regional prompts with unidirectional masks in Transformer layers for regional information extraction. (3) A hierarchical feature alignment module in the intermediate encoder layers to promote the consistency of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we collect 30M images and utilize existing MLLMs to synthesize long-text captions for training. Extensive experiments show that FIX-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both long-text and short-text retrieval benchmarks. For downstream applications, we reveal that FIX-CLIP's text encoder delivers promising performance in a plug-and-play manner for diffusion models with long-text input.

  We present a method for Sparse view reconstruction with surface element splatting that runs within 3 minutes on a consumer grade GPU. While few methods address sparse radiance field learning from noisy or unposed sparse cameras, shape recovery remains relatively underexplored in this setting. Several radiance and shape learning test-time optimization methods address the sparse posed setting by learning data priors or using combinations of external monocular geometry priors. Differently, we propose an efficient and simple pipeline harnessing a single recent 3D foundation model. We leverage its various task heads, notably point maps and camera initializations to instantiate a bundle adjusting 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) model, and image correspondences to guide camera optimization midst 2DGS training. Key to our contribution is a novel formulation of splatted color variance along rays, which can be computed efficiently. Reducing this moment in training leads to more accurate shape reconstructions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performances in the sparse uncalibrated setting in reconstruction and novel view benchmarks based on established multi-view datasets.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In visual place recognition (VPR), filtering and sequence-based matching approaches can improve performance by integrating temporal information across image sequences, especially in challenging conditions. While these methods are commonly applied, their effects on system behavior can be unpredictable and can actually make performance worse in certain situations. In this work, we present a new supervised learning approach that learns to predict the per-frame sequence matching receptiveness (SMR) of VPR techniques, enabling the system to selectively decide when to trust the output of a sequence matching system. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique and effectively predicts SMR, and hence significantly improves VPR performance across a large range of state-of-the-art and classical VPR techniques (namely CosPlace, MixVPR, EigenPlaces, SALAD, AP-GeM, NetVLAD and SAD), and across three benchmark VPR datasets (Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, and SFU-Mountain). We also provide insights into a complementary approach that uses the predictor to replace discarded matches, and present ablation studies including an analysis of the interactions between our SMR predictor and the selected sequence length.

  This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures (diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics) and decoupled heads (computational redundancy) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance-Specific Bottleneck with full-channel global self-attention (ISB) and the Instance-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head (ISADH). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.

  State-of-the-art supervised stereo matching methods have achieved remarkable performance on various benchmarks. However, their generalization to real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world stereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image generation pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes high-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous methods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring pixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to recover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we propose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of unreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity Selection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while preventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments demonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume comparable to Scene Flow.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation model for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for various downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the "error accumulation" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS. The code is released atthis https URL.

  _Aly M. Kassem, Zhuan Shi, Negar Rostamzadeh, Golnoosh Farnadi_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning, emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for understanding and managing LLM behavior.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO adjusts the DPO loss using a weight based on how different the winning prompt is from the original, reducing the impact of training examples that are semantically misaligned. We provide the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1, PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language models.

  Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41 datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings. In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in embedding tasks.

  We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately 300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest andthis http URL, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task. We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory. LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy, achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems, including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading, while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning, this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and broadening access through local deployment.

  The effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning for Large Language Models is fundamentally constrained by the quality and efficiency of training datasets. This work introduces Low-Confidence Gold (LCG), a novel filtering framework that employs centroid-based clustering and confidence-guided selection for identifying valuable instruction pairs. Through a semi-supervised approach using a lightweight classifier trained on representative samples, LCG curates high-quality subsets while preserving data diversity. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that models fine-tuned on LCG-filtered subsets of 6K samples achieve superior performance compared to existing methods, with substantial improvements on MT-bench and consistent gains across comprehensive evaluation metrics. The framework's efficacy while maintaining model performance establishes a promising direction for efficient instruction tuning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We challenge the prevailing assumption that complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs) necessitates massive training data. We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.

  Simulated patient systems play an important role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative medical training environments and supporting clinical decision-making simulations. We developed AIPatient, an intelligent simulated patient system powered by large language model-based AI agents. The system incorporates the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, powered by six task-specific LLM-based AI agents for complex reasoning. For simulation reality, the system is also powered by the AIPatient KG (Knowledge Graph), built with de-identified real patient data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database. Primary outcomes showcase the system's intelligence, including the system's accuracy in Electronic Record (EHR)-based medical Question Answering (QA), readability, robustness, and stability. The system achieved a QA accuracy of 94.15% when all six AI agents present, surpassing benchmarks with partial or no agent integration. Its knowledgebase demonstrated high validity (F1 score=0.89). Readability scores showed median Flesch Reading Ease at 77.23 and median Flesch Kincaid Grade at 5.6, indicating accessibility to all medical professionals. Robustness and stability were confirmed with non-significant variance (ANOVA F-value=0.6126, p > 0.1; F-value=0.782, p > 0.1). A user study with medical students further demonstrated that AIPatient offers high fidelity, strong usability, and effective educational value, performing comparably or better than human-simulated patients in medical history-taking scenarios. The promising intelligence of the AIPatient system highlights its potential to support a wide range of applications, including medical education, model evaluation, and system integration.

  While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic, balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

  In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29 subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios: memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data. The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments, providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167 open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy, underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model performance and propose strategies for enhancement.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.

  As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs. To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of correction-based supervision.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations: 1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and 2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application, and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with unlabeled data.

  Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

  Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated, independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.

  The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty Hiking} step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two key findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by \textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs. SAND-Math dataset is released here: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}

  Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown in reasoning tasks, where two scenarios may appear: (i) an input sample is genuinely unverifiable, but the model cannot understand why; and (ii) a verifiable problem that the model fails to solve, thus outputs Unknown. We refer to these cases collectively as the Vague Perception phenomenon. Current evaluations focus on whether such answers are honest, rather than analyzing the limits of LLM reasoning.To address this, we introduce WakenLLM, a framework that quantifies the portion of Unknown output attributable to model incapacity and evaluates whether stimulation can convert them into either correct answers (verifiable) or justified (unverifiable) responses with valid reasoning. Our method offers a clearer picture of the limits of LLM reasoning and the potential for corrections across various datasets. Comprehensive experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without any training or parameter revision, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% accuracy improvement on Vague Perception samples through guided understanding.Our work reveals that current baseline methods only activate a small portion of LLMs' reasoning potential, indicating considerable unexplored capacity. This extends the theoretical upper bounds of reasoning accuracy in LLMs. Consequently, this study deepens our understanding of the latent reasoning capacity of LLMs and offers a new perspective on addressing the Vague Perception phenomenon.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities to generate responses that simulate consistent personality traits. Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in simulating personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency.

  Mining parallel document pairs for document-level machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to the limitations of existing Cross-Lingual Document Alignment (CLDA) techniques. Most approaches rely on metadata such as URLs, which is often unavailable in low-resource language settings, while others represent documents using pooled sentence embeddings, which fail to capture fine-grained alignment cues. Moreover, current sentence embedding models have limited context windows, hindering their ability to represent document-level information effectively. To address these challenges for Indic languages, we introduce PRALEKHA, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating document-level alignment techniques. It contains over 3 million aligned document pairs across 11 Indic languages and English, of which 1.5 million are English--Indic pairs. Furthermore, we propose Document Alignment Coefficient (DAC), a novel metric for fine-grained document alignment. Unlike pooling-based approaches, DAC aligns documents by matching smaller chunks and computes similarity as the ratio of aligned chunks to the average number of chunks in a pair. Intrinsic evaluation shows that DAC achieves substantial improvements over pooling-based baselines, particularly in noisy scenarios. Extrinsic evaluation further demonstrates that document MT models trained on DAC-aligned pairs consistently outperform those using baseline alignment methods. These results highlight DAC's effectiveness for parallel document mining. The PRALEKHA dataset and CLDA evaluation framework will be made publicly available.

  In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with standard optimal behaviour.

  The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for assistive robotics.

  To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based multi-agent system for robust and automated chemical information extraction. It utilizes the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of diverse chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks, and coordinate a set of specialized agents, each combining the capabilities of the MLLM with the precise, domain-specific strengths of dedicated tools, to solve them accurately and integrate the results into a unified output. Our system achieved an F1 score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of sophisticated multimodal chemical reaction graphics from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score of 35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction. This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical research.

  Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

  The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities. Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training, we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process: 1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a "Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy; and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts. Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they "understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel in text understanding and generation but raise significant safety and ethical concerns in high-stakes applications. To mitigate these risks, we present Libra-Guard, a cutting-edge safeguard system designed to enhance the safety of Chinese-based LLMs. Leveraging a two-stage curriculum training pipeline, Libra-Guard enhances data efficiency by employing guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce Libra-Test, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy, outperforming Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (74.33%) and ShieldLM-Qwen-14B-Chat (65.69%), and nearing closed-source models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o. These contributions establish a robust framework for advancing the safety governance of Chinese LLMs and represent a tentative step toward developing safer, more reliable Chinese AI systems.

  Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs.We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models.To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets.This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal (advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is available atthis https URL.

  In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception, situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K) and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18 sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge, enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval. By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and methodology for advancing research in traffic safety.

  As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual, making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously, representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

  Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores, enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score. This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and practice. Our code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation, balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics, a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM reliability.

  We present INTEGRALBENCH, a focused benchmark designed to evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) performance on definite integral problems. INTEGRALBENCH provides both symbolic and numerical ground truth solutions with manual difficulty annotations. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant performance gaps and strong correlations between problem difficulty and model accuracy, establishing baseline metrics for this challenging domain. INTEGRALBENCH aims to advance automated mathematical reasoning by providing a rigorous evaluation framework specifically tailored for definite integral computation.

  The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure \textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how} they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity. We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of artificial intelligence.

  _Mengyang Li, Zhong Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models with human preferences is crucial for their safe deployment. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO methods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment requires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability, establishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and interpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization.

  Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy AI) has emerged as a promising direction for integrating neural learning with symbolic reasoning. Typically, in the probabilistic variant of such systems, a neural network first extracts a set of symbols from sub-symbolic input, which are then used by a symbolic component to reason in a probabilistic manner towards answering a query. In this work, we address the problem of formally verifying the robustness of such NeSy probabilistic reasoning systems, therefore paving the way for their safe deployment in critical domains. We analyze the complexity of solving this problem exactly, and show that a decision version of the core computation is $\mathrm{NP}^{\mathrm{PP}}$-complete. In the face of this result, we propose the first approach for approximate, relaxation-based verification of probabilistic NeSy systems. We demonstrate experimentally on a standard NeSy benchmark that the proposed method scales exponentially better than solver-based solutions and apply our technique to a real-world autonomous driving domain, where we verify a safety property under large input dimensionalities.
