- **[DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426)**  `arXiv:2509.10426`  `cs.RO` `cs.MA`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.

  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown great potential for cooperative detection and reconnaissance. However, collaborative AUV communications introduce risks of exposure. In adversarial environments, achieving efficient collaboration while ensuring covert operations becomes a key challenge for underwater cooperative missions. In this paper, we propose a novel dual time-scale Hierarchical Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (H-MAPPO) framework. The high-level component determines the individuals participating in the task based on a central AUV, while the low-level component reduces exposure probabilities through power and trajectory control by the participating AUVs. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves rapid convergence, outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of performance, and maximizes long-term cooperative efficiency while ensuring covert operations.

- **[MetricNet: Recovering Metric Scale in Generative Navigation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13965)**  `arXiv:2509.13965`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`  
  _Abhijeet Nayak, D√©bora N.P. Oliveira, Samiran Gode, Cordelia Schmid, Wolfram Burgard_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative navigation policies have made rapid progress in improving end-to-end learned navigation. Despite their promising results, this paradigm has two structural problems. First, the sampled trajectories exist in an abstract, unscaled space without metric grounding. Second, the control strategy discards the full path, instead moving directly towards a single waypoint. This leads to short-sighted and unsafe actions, moving the robot towards obstacles that a complete and correctly scaled path would circumvent. To address these issues, we propose MetricNet, an effective add-on for generative navigation that predicts the metric distance between waypoints, grounding policy outputs in real-world coordinates. We evaluate our method in simulation with a new benchmarking framework and show that executing MetricNet-scaled waypoints significantly improves both navigation and exploration performance. Beyond simulation, we further validate our approach in real-world experiments. Finally, we propose MetricNav, which integrates MetricNet into a navigation policy to guide the robot away from obstacles while still moving towards the goal.

- **[GeoAware-VLA: Implicit Geometry Aware Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14117)**  `arXiv:2509.14117`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ali Abouzeid, Malak Mansour, Zezhou Sun, Dezhen Song_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.

- **[HGACNet: Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for Cross-Modal Point Cloud Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13692)**  `arXiv:2509.13692`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yadan Zeng, Jiadong Zhou, Xiaohan Li, I-Ming Chen_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud completion is essential for robotic perception, object reconstruction and supporting downstream tasks like grasp planning, obstacle avoidance, and manipulation. However, incomplete geometry caused by self-occlusion and sensor limitations can significantly degrade downstream reasoning and interaction. To address these challenges, we propose HGACNet, a novel framework that reconstructs complete point clouds of individual objects by hierarchically encoding 3D geometric features and fusing them with image-guided priors from a single-view RGB image. At the core of our approach, the Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) encoder adaptively selects critical local points through graph attention-based downsampling and progressively refines hierarchical geometric features to better capture structural continuity and spatial relationships. To strengthen cross-modal interaction, we further design a Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Fusion (MSCF) module that performs attention-based feature alignment between hierarchical geometric features and structured visual representations, enabling fine-grained semantic guidance for completion. In addition, we proposed the contrastive loss (C-Loss) to explicitly align the feature distributions across modalities, improving completion fidelity under modality discrepancy. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on both the ShapeNet-ViPC benchmark and the YCB-Complete dataset confirm the effectiveness of HGACNet, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance as well as strong applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

- **[Using Visual Language Models to Control Bionic Hands: Assessment of Object Perception and Grasp Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13572)**  `arXiv:2509.13572`  `cs.RO`  
  _Ozan Karaali, Hossam Farag, Strahinja Dosen, Cedomir Stefanovic_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study examines the potential of utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) to improve the perceptual capabilities of semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. We introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference, evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape, orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34 snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for effective prosthetic applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.

- **[Search-TTA: A Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation Framework for Visual Search in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11350)**  `arXiv:2505.11350`  `cs.RO`  
  _Derek Ming Siang Tan, Shailesh, Boyang Liu, Alok Raj, Qi Xuan Ang, Weiheng Dai, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To perform outdoor autonomous visual navigation and search, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.

  General-purpose robots should possess human-like dexterity and agility to perform tasks with the same versatility as us. A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

- **[ComfyGPT: A Self-Optimizing Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive ComfyUI Workflow Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17671)**  `arXiv:2503.17671`  `cs.MA` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  ComfyUI is a popular workflow-based interface that allows users to customize image generation tasks through an intuitive node-based system. However, the complexity of managing node connections and diverse modules can be challenging for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, a self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. The key innovations of ComfyGPT include: (1) consisting of four specialized agents to build a multi-agent workflow generation system: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent; (2) focusing on generating precise node connections instead of entire workflows, improving generation accuracy; and (3) enhancing workflow generation through reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. Additionally, we propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation, making it a significant step forward in this field.

- **[LLM-I: LLMs are Naturally Interleaved Multimodal Creators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13642)**  `arXiv:2509.13642`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Zirun Guo, Feng Zhang, Kai Jia, Tao Jin_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains. Project Page:this https URL.

- **[A Universal Banach--Bregman Framework for Stochastic Iterations: Unifying Stochastic Mirror Descent, Learning and LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14216)**  `arXiv:2509.14216`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial intelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, natural gradient descent in information geometry, or Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations, establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization. It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations ($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks), deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning (actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.

- **[Bridging Past and Future: Distribution-Aware Alignment for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14181)**  `arXiv:2509.14181`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Yifan Hu, Jie Yang, Tian Zhou, Peiyuan Liu, Yujin Tang, Rong Jin, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Representation learning techniques like contrastive learning have long been explored in time series forecasting, mirroring their success in computer vision and natural language processing. Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep learning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[FedSSG: Expectation-Gated and History-Aware Drift Alignment for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13895)**  `arXiv:2509.13895`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Zhanting Zhou, Jinshan Lai, Fengchun Zhang, Zeqin Wu, Fengli Zhang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-IID data and partial participation induce client drift and inconsistent local optima in federated learning, causing unstable convergence and accuracy loss. We present FedSSG, a stochastic sampling-guided, history-aware drift alignment method. FedSSG maintains a per-client drift memory that accumulates local model differences as a lightweight sketch of historical gradients; crucially, it gates both the memory update and the local alignment term by a smooth function of the observed/expected participation ratio (a phase-by-expectation signal derived from the server sampler). This statistically grounded gate stays weak and smooth when sampling noise dominates early, then strengthens once participation statistics stabilize, contracting the local-global gap without extra communication. Across CIFAR-10/100 with 100/500 clients and 2-15 percent participation, FedSSG consistently outperforms strong drift-aware baselines and accelerates convergence; on our benchmarks it improves test accuracy by up to a few points (e.g., about +0.9 on CIFAR-10 and about +2.7 on CIFAR-100 on average over the top-2 baseline) and yields about 4.5x faster target-accuracy convergence on average. The method adds only O(d) client memory and a constant-time gate, and degrades gracefully to a mild regularizer under near-IID or uniform sampling. FedSSG shows that sampling statistics can be turned into a principled, history-aware phase control to stabilize and speed up federated training.

- **[Masked Diffusion Models as Energy Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13866)**  `arXiv:2509.13866`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Sitong Chen, Shen Nie, Jiacheng Sun, Zijin Feng, Zhenguo Li, Ji-Rong Wen, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a systematic theoretical framework that interprets masked diffusion models (MDMs) as solutions to energy minimization problems in discrete optimal transport. Specifically, we prove that three distinct energy formulations--kinetic, conditional kinetic, and geodesic energy--are mathematically equivalent under the structure of MDMs, and that MDMs minimize all three when the mask schedule satisfies a closed-form optimality condition. This unification not only clarifies the theoretical foundations of MDMs, but also motivates practical improvements in sampling. By parameterizing interpolation schedules via Beta distributions, we reduce the schedule design space to a tractable 2D search, enabling efficient post-training tuning without model modification. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our energy-inspired schedules outperform hand-crafted baselines, particularly in low-step sampling settings.

- **[State Space Models over Directed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13735)**  `arXiv:2509.13735`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Junzhi She, Xunkai Li, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Directed graphs are ubiquitous across numerous domains, where the directionality of edges encodes critical causal dependencies. However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

- **[The Psychogenic Machine: Simulating AI Psychosis, Delusion Reinforcement and Harm Enablement in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10970)**  `arXiv:2509.10970`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse psychological symptoms. Whilst the sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can be beneficial, it becomes a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users.Methods: Psychosis-bench is a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprises 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions) and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across explicit and implicit conversational contexts.Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37 $\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered. Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions (p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77). Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent property of scale alone.Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

- **[LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506)**  `arXiv:2411.18506`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Erin Carson, Xinye Chen, Cheng Kang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.

- **[Compute as Teacher: Turning Inference Compute Into Reference-Free Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14234)**  `arXiv:2509.14234`  `cs.LG`  
  _Dulhan Jayalath, Shashwat Goel, Thomas Foster, Parag Jain, Suchin Gururangan, Cheng Zhang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Where do learning signals come from when there is no ground truth in post-training? We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy) reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers; (ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning (CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.

  _Hyotaek Jeon, Hyunwook Lee, Juwon Kim, Sungahn Ko_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traffic forecasting represents a crucial problem within intelligent transportation systems. In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure. Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As machine learning models grow increasingly complex and computationally demanding, understanding the environmental impact of training decisions becomes critical for sustainable AI development. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study investigating the relationship between optimizer choice and energy efficiency in neural network training. We conducted 360 controlled experiments across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) using eight popular optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, Adamax, NAdam) with 15 random seeds each. Using CodeCarbon for precise energy tracking on Apple M1 Pro hardware, we measured training duration, peak memory usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and final model performance. Our findings reveal substantial trade-offs between training speed, accuracy, and environmental impact that vary across datasets and model complexity. We identify AdamW and NAdam as consistently efficient choices, while SGD demonstrates superior performance on complex datasets despite higher emissions. These results provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to balance performance and sustainability in machine learning workflows.

  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs) on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities. Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ methods while incurring minimal overhead.Our source code is available atthis https URL.

  Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information, causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge, facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

  TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a tiled-block strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework. This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to process long contexts without any pre-processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard TabArena benchmark, with code available atthis https URL.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process, motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy graph.

  Decision Transformer (DT), a trajectory modelling method, has shown competitive performance compared to traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on various classic control tasks. However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors--even on in-distribution samples--exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network. It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

  _Luozheng Qin, Jia Gong, Yuqing Sun, Tianjiao Li, Mengping Yang, Xiaomeng Yang, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures.To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

  Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision--language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models. Project page:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen testthis http URLrobustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks.

  High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.

  Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models' integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

  Existing methods for vision-language task planning excel in short-horizon tasks but often fall short in complex, long-horizon planning within dynamic environments. These challenges primarily arise from the difficulty of effectively training models to produce high-quality reasoning processes for long-horizon tasks. To address this, we propose Structured Preference Optimization (SPO), which aims to enhance reasoning and action selection in long-horizon task planning through structured preference evaluation and optimized training strategies. Specifically, SPO introduces: 1) Preference-Based Scoring and Optimization, which systematically evaluates reasoning chains based on task relevance, visual grounding, and historical consistency; and 2) Curriculum-Guided Training, where the model progressively adapts from simple to complex tasks, improving its generalization ability in long-horizon scenarios and enhancing reasoning robustness. To advance research in vision-language long-horizon task planning, we introduce ExtendaBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering 1,509 tasks across VirtualHome and Habitat 2.0, categorized into ultra-short, short, medium, and long tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPO significantly improves reasoning quality and final decision accuracy, outperforming prior methods on long-horizon tasks and underscoring the effectiveness of preference-driven optimization in vision-language task planning. Specifically, SPO achieves a +5.98% GCR and +4.68% SR improvement in VirtualHome and a +3.30% GCR and +2.11% SR improvement in Habitat over the best-performing baselines.

  _Michal Szczepanski, Martyna Poreba, Karim Haroun_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to 1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the final encoder layer.

  Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient, offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose estimation in real-world space environments.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in \emph{query selection bias}. To address this issue, we propose Triple Query Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame, while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

  Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

  Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

  While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension.

  This paper reviews the MARS2 2025 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning. We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via a large benchmark. We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models. Thus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization pagethis https URL, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided.

  Digital beautification through social media filters has become increasingly popular, raising concerns about the reliability of facial images and videos and the effectiveness of automated face analysis. This issue is particularly critical for digital manipulation detectors, systems aiming at distinguishing between genuine and manipulated data, especially in cases involving deepfakes and morphing attacks designed to deceive humans and automated facial recognition. This study examines whether beauty filters impact the performance of deepfake and morphing attack detectors. We perform a comprehensive analysis, evaluating multiple state-of-the-art detectors on benchmark datasets before and after applying various smoothing filters. Our findings reveal performance degradation, highlighting vulnerabilities introduced by facial enhancements and underscoring the need for robust detection models resilient to such alterations.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

  We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs. With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes, their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions. The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades, contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8 percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

  Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence. Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models, accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have manifested strong visual question answering capability. However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration (SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning" approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample, followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner, leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.

  Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features. To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.

  Hand tracking holds great promise for intuitive interaction paradigms, but frame-based methods often struggle to meet the requirements of accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings such as Extended Reality (XR) devices. Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness changes. In this work, we present EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with 3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues, combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set, EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from 11.2M to 1.2M by 89% and FLOPs per inference from 1.648G to 0.185G by 89%. It also maintains a competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data. These results demonstrate accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking suitable for on-device XR applications.

  Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.

  Semi-supervised learning has been employed to alleviate the need for extensive labeled data for histopathology image segmentation, but existing methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels due to ambiguous gland boundaries and morphological misclassification. This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation. Our approach leverages three specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and CRAG benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in low-label settings, highlighting the potential of MoE-based architectures in advancing semi-supervised segmentation.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to transfer models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. While auxiliary self-supervised tasks-particularly contrastive learning-have improved feature discriminability, masked modeling approaches remain underexplored in this setting, largely due to architectural incompatibility and misaligned optimization objectives. We propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a novel auxiliary task that performs feature masking and reconstruction directly in the feature space. Unlike existing masked modeling methods that reconstruct low-level inputs or perceptual features (e.g., HOG or visual tokens), MFM aligns its learning target with the main segmentation task, ensuring compatibility with standard architectures like DeepLab and DAFormer without modifying the inference pipeline. To facilitate effective reconstruction, we introduce a lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, which is trained jointly but discarded during inference, adding zero computational overhead at test time. Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the pixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task. Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks demonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation.

  While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.

  Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module (PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data, enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can effectively remove the rain streaks as well as preserve the crucial background information. Furthermore, We construct a night scene rainy (NSR) dataset comprising 900 image pairs, all based on real-world nighttime scenes, providing a new benchmark for nighttime deraining task research. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluations on both existing datasets and the NSR dataset consistently demonstrate our method outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in nighttime deraining tasks.

  In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are restricted by limited representationalthis http URLaddress these issues, we propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global, regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage, computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

  Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function. However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.

  Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions. We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset. We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS (histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

  Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.

  Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in dataset acquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new annotated dataset collected with 3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning methodologies, including recent foundation models.

  Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.

  Stereo matching serves as a cornerstone in 3D vision, aiming to establish pixel-wise correspondences between stereo image pairs for depth recovery. Despite remarkable progress driven by deep neural architectures, current models often exhibit severe performance degradation when deployed in unseen domains, primarily due to the limited diversity of training data. In this work, we introduce StereoAnything, a data-centric framework that substantially enhances the zero-shot generalization capability of existing stereo models. Rather than devising yet another specialized architecture, we scale stereo training to an unprecedented level by systematically unifying heterogeneous stereo sources: (1) curated labeled datasets covering diverse environments, and (2) large-scale synthetic stereo pairs generated from unlabeled monocular images. Our mixed-data strategy delivers consistent and robust learning signals across domains, effectively mitigating dataset bias. Extensive zero-shot evaluations on four public benchmarks demonstrate that Stereo Anything achieves state-of-the-art generalization. This work paves the way towards truly universal stereo matching, offering a scalable data paradigm applicable to any stereo image pair. We extensively evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our model on four public datasets, showcasing its impressive ability to generalize to any stereo image pair. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Apertus, a fully open suite of large language models (LLMs) designed to address two systemic shortcomings in today's open model ecosystem: data compliance and multilingual representation. Unlike many prior models that release weights without reproducible data pipelines or regard for content-owner rights, Apertus models are pretrained exclusively on openly available data, retroactively respectingthis http URLexclusions and filtering for non-permissive, toxic, and personally identifiable content. To mitigate risks of memorization, we adopt the Goldfish objective during pretraining, strongly suppressing verbatim recall of data while retaining downstream task performance. The Apertus models also expand multilingual coverage, training on 15T tokens from over 1800 languages, with ~40% of pretraining data allocated to non-English content. Released at 8B and 70B scales, Apertus approaches state-of-the-art results among fully open models on multilingual benchmarks, rivalling or surpassing open-weight counterparts. Beyond model weights, we release all scientific artifacts from our development cycle with a permissive license, including data preparation scripts, checkpoints, evaluation suites, and training code, enabling transparent audit and extension.

  We present Hala, a family of Arabic-centric instruction and translation models built with our translate-and-tune pipeline. We first compress a strong AR$\leftrightarrow$EN teacher to FP8 (yielding $\sim$2$\times$ higher throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual supervision. A lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic, producing a million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train Hala models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric benchmarks, Hala achieves state-of-the-art results within both the "nano" ($\leq$2B) and "small" (7-9B) categories, outperforming their bases. We release models, data, evaluation, and recipes to accelerate research in Arabic NLP.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration, provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency" (SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection over traditional Platt scaling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings, indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.

  Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) hallucination is a significant barrier to their reliable deployment. Current methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are often reactive. We introduce **Dynamic Self-reinforcing Calibration for Hallucination Suppression (DSCC-HS)**, a novel, proactive framework that intervenes during autoregressive decoding. Inspired by dual-process cognitive theory, DSCC-HS uses a compact proxy model, trained in adversarial roles as a Factual Alignment Proxy (FAP) and a Hallucination Detection Proxy (HDP). During inference, these proxies dynamically steer a large target model by injecting a real-time steering vector, which is the difference between FAP and HDP logits, at each decoding step. This plug-and-play approach requires no modification to the target model. Our experiments on TruthfulQA and BioGEN show DSCC-HS achieves state-of-the-art performance. On TruthfulQA, it reached a 99.2% Factual Consistency Rate (FCR). On the long-form BioGEN benchmark, it attained the highest FActScore of 46.50. These results validate DSCC-HS as a principled and efficient solution for enhancing LLM factuality.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with context fidelity, producing inconsistent answers when responding to questions based on provided information. Existing approaches either rely on expensive supervised fine-tuning to generate evidence post-answer or train models to perform web searches without necessarily improving utilization of the given context. We propose CARE, a novel native retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that teaches LLMs to explicitly integrate in-context evidence within their reasoning process with the model's own retrieval capabilities. Our method requires limited labeled evidence data while significantly enhancing both retrieval accuracy and answer generation performance through strategically retrieved in-context tokens in the reasoning chain. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world and counterfactual QA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms supervised fine-tuning, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods, and external retrieval solutions. This work represents a fundamental advancement in making LLMs more accurate, reliable, and efficient for knowledge-intensive tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing demand for automated writing assistance in diverse academic domains highlights the need for robust Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) systems that can adapt across disciplines. However, existing CGEC research largely lacks dedicated benchmarks for multi-disciplinary academic writing, overlooking continual learning (CL) as a promising solution to handle domain-specific linguistic variation and prevent catastrophic forgetting. To fill this crucial gap, we introduce CL$^2$GEC, the first Continual Learning benchmark for Chinese Literature Grammatical Error Correction, designed to evaluate adaptive CGEC across multiple academic fields. Our benchmark includes 10,000 human-annotated sentences spanning 10 disciplines, each exhibiting distinct linguistic styles and error patterns. CL$^2$GEC focuses on evaluating grammatical error correction in a continual learning setting, simulating sequential exposure to diverse academic disciplines to reflect real-world editorial dynamics. We evaluate large language models under sequential tuning, parameter-efficient adaptation, and four representative CL algorithms, using both standard GEC metrics and continual learning metrics adapted to task-level variation. Experimental results reveal that regularization-based methods mitigate forgetting more effectively than replay-based or naive sequential approaches. Our benchmark provides a rigorous foundation for future research in adaptive grammatical error correction across diverse academic domains.

  This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models' ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models, including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:this https URL

  Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.

  We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated Hindi-English code-mixed dataset, comprising 125K+ high-quality instances across five core NLP tasks: Matrix Language Identification, Token-level Language Identification, Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Machine Translation. Each instance is annotated by three bilingual annotators, yielding over 376K expert annotations with strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa $\geq$ 0.81). The rigorously preprocessed and filtered dataset covers both Devanagari and Roman scripts and spans diverse domains, ensuring real-world linguistic coverage. Evaluation reveals that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform traditional tools and open-source models in zero-shot settings. Notably, one-shot prompting consistently boosts performance across tasks, especially in structure-sensitive predictions like POS and NER. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on COMI-LINGUA demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving up to 95.25 F1 in NER, 98.77 F1 in MLI, and competitive MT performance, setting new benchmarks for Hinglish code-mixed text.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention, offering a promising pathway toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Among the essential capabilities required for AGI, creativity has emerged as a critical trait for MLLMs, with association serving as its foundation. Association reflects a model' s ability to think creatively, making it vital to evaluate and understand. While several frameworks have been proposed to assess associative ability, they often overlook the inherent ambiguity in association tasks, which arises from the divergent nature of associations and undermines the reliability of evaluations. To address this issue, we decompose ambiguity into two types-internal ambiguity and external ambiguity-and introduce AssoCiAm, a benchmark designed to evaluate associative ability while circumventing the ambiguity through a hybrid computational method. We then conduct extensive experiments on MLLMs, revealing a strong positive correlation between cognition and association. Additionally, we observe that the presence of ambiguity in the evaluation process causes MLLMs' behavior to become more random-like. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in ensuring more accurate and reliable evaluations. See Project Page for the data and codes.

  _Yaxin Gao, Yao Lu, Zongfei Zhang, Jiaqi Nie, Shanqing Yu, Qi Xuan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. To achieve more accurate output, the prompts used to drive LLMs have become increasingly longer, which incurs higher computational costs. To address this prompt inflation problem, prompt compression has been proposed. However, most existing methods require training a small auxiliary model for compression, incurring a significant amount of additional computation. To avoid this, we propose a two-stage, training-free approach, called Dual-Stage Progressive Compression (DSPC). In the coarse-grained stage, semantic-related sentence filtering removes sentences with low semantic value based on TF-IDF. In the fine-grained stage, token importance is assessed using attention contribution, cross-model loss difference, and positional importance, enabling the pruning of low-utility tokens while preserving semantics. We validate DSPC on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and GPT-3.5-Turbo under a constrained token budget and observe consistent improvements. For instance, in the FewShot task of the Longbench dataset, DSPC achieves a performance of 49.17 by using only 3x fewer tokens, outperforming the best state-of-the-art baseline LongLLMLingua by 7.76.

  Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions. We further test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38%, respectively.

  Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing research and to foster further developments in this field.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding and generation, leading to extensive benchmarking across diverse tasks. However, cryptanalysis - a critical area for data security and its connection to LLMs' generalization abilities - remains underexplored in LLM evaluations. To address this gap, we evaluate the cryptanalytic potential of state-of-the-art LLMs on ciphertexts produced by a range of cryptographic algorithms. We introduce a benchmark dataset of diverse plaintexts, spanning multiple domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics, paired with their encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few-shot settings along with chain-of-thought prompting, we assess LLMs' decryption success rate and discuss their comprehension abilities. Our findings reveal key insights into LLMs' strengths and limitations in side-channel scenarios and raise concerns about their susceptibility to under-generalization-related attacks. This research highlights the dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing discussion on AI safety and security.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SCRum-9, the largest multilingual Stance Classification dataset for Rumour analysis in 9 languages, containing 7,516 tweets from X. SCRum-9 goes beyond existing stance classification datasets by covering more languages, linking examples to more fact-checked claims (2.1k), and including confidence-related annotations from multiple annotators to account for intra- and inter-annotator variability. Annotations were made by at least two native speakers per language, totalling more than 405 hours of annotation and 8,150 dollars in compensation. Further, SCRum-9 is used to benchmark five large language models (LLMs) and two multilingual masked language models (MLMs) in In-Context Learning (ICL) and fine-tuning setups. This paper also innovates by exploring the use of multilingual synthetic data for rumour stance classification, showing that even LLMs with weak ICL performance can produce valuable synthetic data for fine-tuning small MLMs, enabling them to achieve higher performance than zero-shot ICL in LLMs. Finally, we examine the relationship between model predictions and human uncertainty on ambiguous cases finding that model predictions often match the second-choice labels assigned by annotators, rather than diverging entirely from human judgments. SCRum-9 is publicly released to the research community with potential to foster further research on multilingual analysis of misleading narratives on social media.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on advanced mathematics benchmarks but sometimes fail on basic arithmetic tasks, raising the question of whether they have truly grasped fundamental arithmetic rules or are merely relying on pattern matching. To unravel this issue, we systematically probe LLMs' understanding of two-integer addition ($0$ to $2^{64}$) by testing three crucial properties: commutativity ($A+B=B+A$), representation invariance via symbolic remapping (e.g., $7 \mapsto Y$), and consistent accuracy scaling with operand length. Our evaluation of 12 leading LLMs reveals a stark disconnect: while models achieve high numeric accuracy (73.8-99.8%), they systematically fail these diagnostics. Specifically, accuracy plummets to $\le 7.5$% with symbolic inputs, commutativity is violated in up to 20% of cases, and accuracy scaling is non-monotonic. Interventions further expose this pattern-matching reliance: explicitly providing rules degrades performance by 29.49%, while prompting for explanations before answering merely maintains baseline accuracy. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs address elementary addition via pattern matching, not robust rule induction, motivating new diagnostic benchmarks and innovations in model architecture and training to cultivate genuine mathematical reasoning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit social biases inherited from their training data. While existing benchmarks evaluate bias by term-based mode through direct term associations between demographic terms and bias terms, LLMs have become increasingly adept at avoiding biased responses, leading to seemingly low levels of bias. However, biases persist in subtler, contextually hidden forms that traditional benchmarks fail to capture. We introduce the Description-based Bias Benchmark (DBB), a novel dataset designed to assess bias at the semantic level that bias concepts are hidden within naturalistic, subtly framed contexts in real-world scenarios rather than superficial terms. We analyze six state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing that while models reduce bias in response at the term level, they continue to reinforce biases in nuanced settings. Data, code, and results are available atthis https URL.

  The capability of large language models to handle long-context information is crucial across various real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often rely either on real-world long texts, making it difficult to exclude the influence of models' inherent knowledge, or introduce irrelevant filler content to artificially achieve target lengths, reducing assessment effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce NeedleBench, a synthetic framework for assessing retrieval and reasoning performance in bilingual long-context tasks with adaptive context lengths. NeedleBench systematically embeds key data points at varying depths to rigorously test model capabilities. Tasks are categorized into two scenarios: information-sparse, featuring minimal relevant details within extensive irrelevant text to simulate simple retrieval tasks; and information-dense (the Ancestral Trace Challenge), where relevant information is continuously distributed throughout the context to simulate complex reasoning tasks. Our experiments reveal that although recent reasoning models like Deepseek-R1 and OpenAI's o3 excel in mathematical reasoning, they struggle with continuous retrieval and reasoning in information-dense scenarios, even at shorter context lengths. We also characterize a phenomenon termed 'under-thinking', where models prematurely conclude reasoning despite available information. NeedleBench thus provides critical insights and targeted tools essential for evaluating and improving LLMs' long-context capabilities. All resources are available at OpenCompass:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning agent development traditionally requires extensive expertise and lengthy iterations, often resulting in high failure rates and limited accessibility. This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive, high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention. $Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent serves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates executable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically generated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct stages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$ provides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous improvement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently outperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55% performance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly end-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in which intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a fundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries--a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models' safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios. We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages.

  Modern consumer banking applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems. Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our framework features a few-shot example strategy, where each agent receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world major bank dataset as well as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a 14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public benchmarks when compared with traditional and single-agent annotation techniques. Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making it well-suited for deployment in production banking applications while showing strong generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.

  We introduce SteeringControl, a benchmark for evaluating representation steering methods across core alignment objectives--bias, harmful generation, and hallucination--and their effects on secondary behaviors such as sycophancy and commonsense morality. While prior alignment work often highlights truthfulness or reasoning ability to demonstrate the side effects of representation steering, we find there are many unexplored tradeoffs not yet understood in a systematic way. We collect a dataset of safety-relevant primary and secondary behaviors to evaluate steering effectiveness and behavioral entanglement centered around five popular steering methods. To enable this, we craft a modular steering framework based on unique components that serve as the building blocks of many existing methods. Our results on Qwen-2.5-7B and Llama-3.1-8B find that strong steering performance is dependent on the specific combination of steering method, model, and targeted behavior, and that severe concept entanglement can result from poor combinations of these three as well. We release our code here:this https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their ability to perform structured symbolic planning remains limited, particularly in domains requiring formal representations like the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In this paper, we present a novel instruction tuning framework, PDDL-Instruct, designed to enhance LLMs' symbolic planning capabilities through logical chain-of-thought reasoning. Our approach focuses on teaching models to rigorously reason about action applicability, state transitions, and plan validity using explicit logical inference steps. By developing instruction prompts that guide models through the precise logical reasoning required to determine when actions can be applied in a given state, we enable LLMs to self-correct their planning processes through structured reflection. The framework systematically builds verification skills by decomposing the planning process into explicit reasoning chains about precondition satisfaction, effect application, and invariant preservation. Experimental results on multiple planning domains show that our chain-of-thought reasoning based instruction-tuned models are significantly better at planning, achieving planning accuracy of up to 94% on standard benchmarks, representing a 66% absolute improvement over baseline models. This work bridges the gap between the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the logical precision required for automated planning, offering a promising direction for developing better AI planning systems.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted as automated judges in benchmarking and reward modeling, ensuring their reliability, efficiency, and robustness has become critical. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of "thinking" and "non-thinking" LLMs in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm using open-source Qwen 3 models of relatively small sizes (0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B parameters). We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on RewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking models, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based evaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these enhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking counterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10% points higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to augmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a higher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that thinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of bias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random biases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the multilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends its benefits beyond English. Overall, our work results in several important findings that provide systematic evidence that explicit reasoning offers clear advantages in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm not only in accuracy and efficiency but also in robustness.

  Linear constraints are one of the most fundamental constraints in fields such as computer science, operations research and optimization. Many applications reduce to the task of model counting over integer linear constraints (MCILC). In this paper, we design an exact approach to MCILC based on an exhaustive DPLL architecture. To improve the efficiency, we integrate several effective simplification techniques from mixed integer programming into the architecture. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art MCILC counters and propositional model counters on 2840 random and 4131 application benchmarks. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms all exact methods in random benchmarks solving 1718 instances while the state-of-the-art approach only computes 1470 instances. In addition, our approach is the only approach to solve all 4131 application instances.

  The choice of action spaces is a critical yet unresolved challenge in developing capable, end-to-end trainable agents. This paper first presents a large-scale, systematic comparison of prominent abstracted action spaces and tokenizers for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) or hierarchical agent models in the open-ended Minecraft. Our analysis reveals that no single action space is universally optimal; instead, the most effective abstraction is highly task-dependent, creating a dilemma for building generalist agents. To resolve this, we introduce Chain of Action (CoA), a novel framework that unifies high-level planning and low-level control within a single, monolithic VLA model. CoA treats an abstracted action not as a command for a separate policy, but as an intermediate reasoning step--akin to a chain of thought--that guides the generation of the final, executable action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an All-in-One agent trained on a diverse mixture of action spaces using the CoA paradigm learns a more robust and generalizable policy. This unified agent achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving the overall task success rate over strong, specialized baselines. To foster reproducible research, we release the OpenHA (Open Hierarchical Agents) suite, which includes our comprehensive benchmark of over 800 distinct tasks, curated datasets, source code, and all pretrained model checkpoints atthis https URL

  This position paper contends that modern AI research must adopt an antifragile perspective on safety -- one in which the system's capacity to guarantee long-term AI safety such as handling rare or out-of-distribution (OOD) events expands over time. Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot robustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models, if left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.g., reward hacking, over-optimization, or atrophy of broader capabilities). We argue that an antifragile approach -- Rather than striving to rapidly reduce current uncertainties, the emphasis is on leveraging those uncertainties to better prepare for potentially greater, more unpredictable uncertainties in the future -- is pivotal for the long-term reliability of open-ended ML systems. In this position paper, we first identify key limitations of static testing, including scenario diversity, reward hacking, and over-alignment. We then explore the potential of antifragile solutions to manage rare events. Crucially, we advocate for a fundamental recalibration of the methods used to measure, benchmark, and continually improve AI safety over the long term, complementing existing robustness approaches by providing ethical and practical guidelines towards fostering an antifragile AI safety community.

  Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability. While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent tothis http URLaddress these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated \textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes NCOPs resolution through learning to relax withthis http URL, we leverage structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance over the baselines.

  _Enci Zhang, Xingang Yan, Wei Lin, Tianxiang Zhang, Qianchun Lu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.
