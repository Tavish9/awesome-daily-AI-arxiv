- **[A Multi-Level Similarity Approach for Single-View Object Grasping: Matching, Planning, and Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11938)**  `arXiv:2507.11938`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion. However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping, we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective: similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models, identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor, the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under single-view conditions.

  Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data.

- **[Assessing the Value of Visual Input: A Benchmark of Multimodal Large Language Models for Robotic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12391)**  `arXiv:2507.12391`  `cs.RO`  
  _Jacinto Colan, Ana Davila, Yasuhisa Hasegawa_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for enhancing robotic path planning. This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems, and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future LLM development in robotic path planning.

- **[UniLGL: Learning Uniform Place Recognition for FOV-limited/Panoramic LiDAR Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12194)**  `arXiv:2507.12194`  `cs.RO`  
  _Hongming Shen, Xun Chen, Yulin Hui, Zhenyu Wu, Wei Wang, Qiyang Lyu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g., geometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous LiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL method is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and material uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the proposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both geometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial BEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network is designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and material uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a viewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional translation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and supervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors and local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local features on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose estimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on SE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world environments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively competitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL has been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping as well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments, demonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.

- **[STEP Planner: Constructing cross-hierarchical subgoal tree as an embodied long-horizon task planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21030)**  `arXiv:2506.21030`  `cs.RO`  
  _Tianxing Zhou, Zhirui Wang, Haojia Ao, Guangyan Chen, Boyang Xing, Jingwen Cheng, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and 25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

- **[The Impact of Coreset Selection on Spurious Correlations and Group Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11690)**  `arXiv:2507.11690`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Amaya Dharmasiri, William Yang, Polina Kirichenko, Lydia Liu, Olga Russakovsky_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning. However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty, and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes. Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

- **[Nonlinear Concept Erasure: a Density Matching Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12341)**  `arXiv:2507.12341`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Antoine Saillenfest, Pirmin Lemberger_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

- **[Online Training and Pruning of Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11975)**  `arXiv:2507.11975`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.RO`  
  _Valentin Frank Ingmar Guenter, Athanasios Sideris_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

  Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.

- **[CLID-MU: Cross-Layer Information Divergence Based Meta Update Strategy for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11807)**  `arXiv:2507.11807`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Ruofan Hu, Dongyu Zhang, Huayi Zhang, Elke Rundensteiner_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

- **[GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628)**  `arXiv:2507.10628`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

- **[Extension OL-MDISF: Online Learning from Mix-Typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10594)**  `arXiv:2507.10594`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Shengda Zhuo, Di Wu, Yi He, Shuqiang Huang, Xindong Wu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Additionally, the time and cost constraints make it infeasible to label every data instance in a supervised setting. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new algorithm Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features (OL-MDISF), which aims to relax restrictions on both feature types, data distribution, and supervision information. Our approach involves utilizing copula models to create a comprehensive latent space, employing an adaptive sliding window for detecting drift points to ensure model stability, and establishing label proximity information based on geometric structural relationships. To demonstrate the model's efficiency and effectiveness, we provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results.This extension serves as a standalone technical reference to the original OL-MDISF method. It provides (i) a contextual analysis of OL-MDISF within the broader landscape of online learning, covering recent advances in mixed-type feature modeling, concept drift adaptation, and weak supervision, and (ii) a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include full CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document can serve as a reproducible benchmark and technical resource for researchers working on nonstationary, heterogeneous, and weakly supervised data streams.

  Artificial intelligence holds immense promise for transforming biology, yet a lack of standardized, cross domain, benchmarks undermines our ability to build robust, trustworthy models. Here, we present insights from a recent workshop that convened machine learning and computational biology experts across imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics, and genomics to tackle this gap. We identify major technical and systemic bottlenecks such as data heterogeneity and noise, reproducibility challenges, biases, and the fragmented ecosystem of publicly available resources and propose a set of recommendations for building benchmarking frameworks that can efficiently compare ML models of biological systems across tasks and data modalities. By promoting high quality data curation, standardized tooling, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and open, collaborative platforms, we aim to accelerate the development of robust benchmarks for AI driven Virtual Cells. These benchmarks are crucial for ensuring rigor, reproducibility, and biological relevance, and will ultimately advance the field toward integrated models that drive new discoveries, therapeutic insights, and a deeper understanding of cellular systems.

- **[Towards Understanding Link Predictor Generalizability Under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08788)**  `arXiv:2406.08788`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Jay Revolinsky, Harry Shomer, Jiliang Tang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art link prediction (LP) models demonstrate impressive benchmark results. However, popular benchmark datasets often assume that training, validation, and testing samples are representative of the overall dataset distribution. In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; uncontrolled factors lead new dataset samples to come from a different distribution than training samples. Additionally, the majority of recent work with graph dataset shift focuses on node- and graph-level tasks, largely ignoring link-level tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel splitting strategy, known as LPShift, which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify LPShift's effect through empirical evaluation of SOTA LP models on 16 LPShift variants of original dataset splits, with results indicating drastic changes to model performance. Additional experiments demonstrate graph structure has a strong influence on the success of current generalization methods. Source Code Available Here:this https URL

- **[Targeted Deep Architectures: A TMLE-Based Framework for Robust Causal Inference in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12435)**  `arXiv:2507.12435`  `cs.LG`  
  _Yi Li, David Mccoy, Nolan Gunter, Kaitlyn Lee, Alejandro Schuler, Mark van der Laan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits, existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for complex multi-parameter targets.

- **[Heat Kernel Goes Topological](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12380)**  `arXiv:2507.12380`  `cs.LG`  
  _Maximilian Krahn, Vikas Garg_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing, which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration into modern transformer-based architectures.Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency. Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.

  Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically, our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships, demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications demanding robust and realistic modeling of multi-component coherence

  As privacy regulations become more stringent and access to real-world data becomes increasingly constrained, synthetic data generation has emerged as a vital solution, especially for tabular datasets, which are central to domains like finance, healthcare and the social sciences. This survey presents a comprehensive and focused review of recent advances in synthetic tabular data generation, emphasizing methods that preserve complex feature relationships, maintain statistical fidelity, and satisfy privacy requirements. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel taxonomy based on practical generation objectives, including intended downstream applications, privacy guarantees, and data utility, directly informing methodological design and evaluation strategies. Therefore, this review prioritizes the actionable goals that drive synthetic data creation, including conditional generation and risk-sensitive modeling. Additionally, the survey proposes a benchmark framework to align technical innovation with real-world demands. By bridging theoretical foundations with practical deployment, this work serves as both a roadmap for future research and a guide for implementing synthetic tabular data in privacy-critical environments.

- **[SAMO: A Lightweight Sharpness-Aware Approach for Multi-Task Optimization with Joint Global-Local Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07883)**  `arXiv:2507.07883`  `cs.LG`  
  _Hao Ban, Gokul Ram Subramani, Kaiyi Ji_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts, where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and individual task gradients-referred to as global and local information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover, directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight \textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code is available atthis https URL.

  While kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks offer complementary strengths, integrating the two has posed challenges in efficiency and scalability. The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel provides a theoretical bridge by interpreting GNNs through the lens of neural tangent kernels. However, its reliance on deep, stacked layers introduces repeated computations that hinder performance. In this work, we introduce a new perspective by designing the simplified graph kernel, which replaces deep layer stacking with a streamlined $K$-step message aggregation process. This formulation avoids iterative layer-wise propagation altogether, leading to a more concise and computationally efficient framework without sacrificing the expressive power needed for graph tasks. Beyond this simplification, we propose another Simplified Graph Kernel, which draws from Gaussian Process theory to model infinite-width GNNs. Rather than simulating network depth, this kernel analytically computes kernel values based on the statistical behavior of nonlinear activations in the infinite limit. This eliminates the need for explicit architecture simulation, further reducing complexity. Our experiments on standard graph and node classification benchmarks show that our methods achieve competitive accuracy while reducing runtime. This makes them practical alternatives for learning on graphs at scale. Full implementation and reproducibility materials are provided at:this https URL.

- **[Sparse Orthogonal Parameters Tuning for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02813)**  `arXiv:2411.02813`  `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning methods based on pre-trained models (PTM) have recently gained attention which adapt to successive downstream tasks without catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically refrain from updating the pre-trained parameters and instead employ additional adapters, prompts, and classifiers. In this paper, we from a novel perspective investigate the benefit of sparse orthogonal parameters for continual learning. We found that merging sparse orthogonality of models learned from multiple streaming tasks has great potential in addressing catastrophic forgetting. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel yet effective method called SoTU (Sparse Orthogonal Parameters TUning). We hypothesize that the effectiveness of SoTU lies in the transformation of knowledge learned from multiple domains into the fusion of orthogonal delta parameters. Experimental evaluations on diverse CL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, SoTU achieves optimal feature representation for streaming data without necessitating complex classifier designs, making it a Plug-and-Play solution.

  Predicting the biophysical and functional properties of proteins is essential for in silico protein design. Machine learning has emerged as a promising technique for such prediction tasks. However, the relative scarcity of in vitro annotations means that these models often have little, or no, specific data on the desired fitness prediction task. As a result of limited data, protein language models (PLMs) are typically trained on general protein sequence modeling tasks, and then fine-tuned, or applied zero-shot, to protein fitness prediction. When no task data is available, the models make strong assumptions about the correlation between the protein sequence likelihood and fitness scores. In contrast, we propose meta-learning over a distribution of standard fitness prediction tasks, and demonstrate positive transfer to unseen fitness prediction tasks. Our method, called Metalic (Meta-Learning In-Context), uses in-context learning and fine-tuning, when data is available, to adapt to new tasks. Crucially, fine-tuning enables considerable generalization, even though it is not accounted for during meta-training. Our fine-tuned models achieve strong results with 18 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our method sets a new state-of-the-art in low-data settings on ProteinGym, an established fitness-prediction benchmark. Due to data scarcity, we believe meta-learning will play a pivotal role in advancing protein engineering.

  Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is widely adopted in modern vehicles, yet its real-world performance remains underexplored due to proprietary systems and limited data access. This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving data from 62 production vehicle models, collected through extensive road testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from thethis http URLdriving community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i) full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures); ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning; iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current road infrastructure for autonomous driving.

  Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in general multimodal comprehension but often struggle to capture nuanced, context-dependent visual cues. This makes it difficult to distinguish between similar-looking concepts with potentially different cultural meanings. Such deficiencies are mainly due to a limited amount of high-quality cultural data, contextual information, and the lack of negative examples that highlight subtle differences. To mitigate this, we design a data curation pipeline leveraging open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but are culturally different. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to develop CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through tailored contrastive learning. Experiments on culture-specific benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

  Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each instance within the multi-instance image.

  Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grainedthis http URLeffectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets.

  _Wenhao Li, Yudong Xu, Scott Sanner, Elias Boutros Khalil_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight: hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL** (**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority and generalization ability.

  The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this, we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance. We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR). Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time HAR applications.

  Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures, including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and robust object detection architectures.

  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities, but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity, explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality. Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by 5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance. Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

  Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for efficient inference.Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly, ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

  Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views, which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles, enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained input conditions.

  Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance. However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation, and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656 MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions, were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain, respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to clinical adoption.

  Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization. Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias), an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72% improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory usage on ImageNet.

  Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First, existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally, ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting (PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model. Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually. Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness.

  Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

  Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures. In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AGI) technology, the accurate assessment of their quality has become an increasingly vital requirement. Prevailing methods typically rely on cross-modal models like CLIP or BLIP to evaluate text-image alignment and visual quality. However, when applied to AGIs, these methods encounter two primary challenges: semantic misalignment and details perception missing. To address these limitations, we propose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints to significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image consistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach integrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned challenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic Alignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and comparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and the Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which draws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing frequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to better quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of fine-grained visual quality details in images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SC-AGIQA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era. While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

  Synthesizing normal-light novel views from low-light multiview images is an important yet challenging task, given the low visibility and high ISO noise present in the input images. Existing low-light enhancement methods often struggle to effectively preprocess such low-light inputs, as they fail to consider correlations among multiple views. Although other state-of-the-art methods have introduced illumination-related components offering alternative solutions to the problem, they often result in drawbacks such as color distortions and artifacts, and they provide limited denoising effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel Robust Low-light Scene Restoration framework (RoSe), which enables effective synthesis of novel views in normal lighting conditions from low-light multiview image inputs, by formulating the task as an illuminance transition estimation problem in 3D space, conceptualizing it as a specialized rendering task. This multiview-consistent illuminance transition field establishes a robust connection between low-light and normal-light conditions. By further exploiting the inherent low-rank property of illumination to constrain the transition representation, we achieve more effective denoising without complex 2D techniques or explicit noise modeling. To implement RoSe, we design a concise dual-branch architecture and introduce a low-rank denoising module. Experiments demonstrate that RoSe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in both rendering quality and multiview consistency on standard benchmarks.

  Atypical mitosis marks a deviation in the cell division process that has been shown be an independent prognostic marker for tumor malignancy. However, atypical mitosis classification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle morphological differences from normal mitotic figures, low inter-rater agreement among pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification, including end-to-end trained deep learning models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new held-out AMF datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitotic figures from the TCGA breast cancer cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitotic figures from a subset of the MIDOG++ training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135, 0.7788, and 0.7723 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively. Our work shows that atypical mitotic figure classification, while being a challenging problem, can be effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning and model fine-tuning techniques.

  Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored challenge for Document Intelligence and Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems. We present DRISHTIKON, a multi-granular and multi-block visual grounding framework designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual documents. Our approach integrates multilingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to localize answer spans at the block, line, word, and point levels. We introduce the Multi-Granular Visual Grounding (MGVG) benchmark, a curated test set of diverse circular notifications from various sectors, each manually annotated with fine-grained, human-verified labels across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity providing the best balance between precision and recall. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning. Comparative evaluations reveal that leading vision-language models struggle with precise localization, underscoring the effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in real-world, text-centric scenarios with multi-granular grounding support. Code and dataset are made available for future research.

  Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii) image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.

  We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models. The codes and data:this https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art transformer-based large multimodal models (LMMs) struggle to handle hour-long video inputs due to the quadratic complexity of the causal self-attention operations, leading to high computational costs during training and inference. Existing token compression-based methods reduce the number of video tokens but often incur information loss and remain inefficient for extremely long sequences. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction to build a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model (VAMBA) that employs Mamba-2 blocks to encode video tokens with linear complexity. Without any token reduction, VAMBA can encode more than 1024 frames (640$\times$360) on a single GPU, while transformer-based models can only encode 256 frames. On long video input, VAMBA achieves at least 50% reduction in GPU memory usage during training and inference, and nearly doubles the speed per training step compared to transformer-based LMMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VAMBA improves accuracy by 4.3% on the challenging hour-long video understanding benchmark LVBench over prior efficient video LMMs, and maintains strong performance on a broad spectrum of long and short video understanding tasks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SeaS, a unified industrial generative model for automatically creating diverse anomalies, authentic normal products, and precise anomaly masks. While extensive research exists, most efforts either focus on specific tasks, i.e., anomalies or normal products only, or require separate models for each anomaly type. Consequently, prior methods either offer limited generative capability or depend on a vast array of anomaly-specific models. We demonstrate that U-Net's differentiated learning ability captures the distinct visual traits of slightly-varied normal products and diverse anomalies, enabling us to construct a unified model for all tasks. Specifically, we first introduce an Unbalanced Abnormal (UA) Text Prompt, comprising one normal token and multiple anomaly tokens. More importantly, our Decoupled Anomaly Alignment (DA) loss decouples anomaly attributes and binds them to distinct anomaly tokens of UA, enabling SeaS to create unseen anomalies by recombining these attributes. Furthermore, our Normal-image Alignment (NA) loss aligns the normal token to normal patterns, making generated normal products globally consistent and locally varied. Finally, SeaS produces accurate anomaly masks by fusing discriminative U-Net features with high-resolution VAE features. SeaS sets a new benchmark for industrial generation, significantly enhancing downstream applications, with average improvements of $+8.66\%$ pixel-level AP for synthesis-based AD approaches, $+1.10\%$ image-level AP for unsupervised AD methods, and $+12.79\%$ IoU for supervised segmentation models.

  Localizing predefined 3D keypoints in a 2D image is an effective way to establish 3D-2D correspondences for instance-level 6DoF object pose estimation. However, unreliable localization results of invisible keypoints degrade the quality of correspondences. In this paper, we address this issue by localizing the important keypoints in terms of visibility. Since keypoint visibility information is currently missing in the dataset collection process, we propose an efficient way to generate binary visibility labels from available object-level annotations, for keypoints of both asymmetric objects and symmetric objects. We further derive real-valued visibility-aware importance from binary labels based on the PageRank algorithm. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our visibility-aware importance, we construct VAPO (Visibility-Aware POse estimator) by integrating the visibility-aware importance with a state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm, along with additional positional encoding. VAPO can work in both CAD-based and CAD-free settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular pose estimation benchmarks including Linemod, Linemod-Occlusion, and YCB-V, demonstrating that VAPO clearly achieves state-of-the-art performances.

  Consensus amongst researchers and industry points to a lack of large, representative annotated datasets as the biggest obstacle to progress in the field of surgical data science. Advances in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) represent a solution, reducing the dependence on large labeled datasets by providing task-agnostic initializations. However, the robustness of current self-supervised learning methods to domain shifts remains unclear, limiting our understanding of its utility for leveraging diverse sources of surgical data. Shifting the focus from methods to data, we demonstrate that the downstream value of SSL-based initializations is intricately intertwined with the composition of pre-training datasets. These results underscore an important gap that needs to be filled as we scale self-supervised approaches toward building general-purpose "foundation models" that enable diverse use-cases within the surgical domain. Through several stages of controlled experimentation, we develop recommendations for pretraining dataset composition evidenced through over 300 experiments spanning 20 pre-training datasets, 9 surgical procedures, 7 centers (hospitals), 3 labeled-data settings, 3 downstream tasks, and multiple runs. Using the approaches here described, we outperform state-of-the-art pre-trainings on two public benchmarks for phase recognition: up to 2.2% on Cholec80 and 5.1% on AutoLaparo.

  Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline (4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

  Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionised many fields, with LLM-as-a-service (LLMSaaS) offering accessible, general-purpose solutions without costly task-specific training. In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for directly solving tasks (in vivo), this paper explores LLMs' potential for in-vitro applications: using LLM-generated labels to improve supervised training of mainstream models. We examine two strategies - (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation - in empathy computing, an emerging task to predict psychology-based questionnaire outcomes from inputs like textual narratives. Crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. We show that replacing or supplementing these crowdsourced labels with LLM-generated labels, developed using psychology-based scale-aware prompts, achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements. Notably, the RoBERTa pre-trained language model (PLM) trained with noise-reduced labels yields a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on the public NewsEmp benchmarks. This paper further analyses evaluation metric selection and demographic biases to help guide the future development of more equitable empathy computing models.

  Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

  Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derivedthis http URLaddition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code atthis https URL, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.

  Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap, we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale Coreference Resolution systems atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images; (2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation, where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer; and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where auditing results are critical.

  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.

  _Hongliu Cao_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated gaps in diverse cultural awareness across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs' ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.

  We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench, GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling evidence of its efficacy.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval, are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1) 25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges, and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional constraint adherence across languages.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and grammatical acceptability judgment (COLA) are core tasks in natural language processing, sharing foundational grammatical knowledge yet typically evolving independently. This paper introduces COLA-GEC, a novel bidirectional framework that enhances both tasks through mutual knowledge transfer. First, we augment grammatical acceptability models using GEC datasets, significantly improving their performance across multiple languages. Second, we integrate grammatical acceptability signals into GEC model training via a dynamic loss function, effectively guiding corrections toward grammatically acceptable outputs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several multilingual benchmarks. Comprehensive error analysis highlights remaining challenges, particularly in punctuation error correction, providing insights for future improvements in grammatical modeling.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to 0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

  Academic paper review is a critical yet time-consuming task within the research community. With the increasing volume of academic publications, automating the review process has become a significant challenge. The primary issue lies in generating comprehensive, accurate, and reasoning-consistent review comments that align with human reviewers' judgments. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing ReviewAgents, a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate academic paper reviews. We first introduce a novel dataset, Review-CoT, consisting of 142k review comments, designed for training LLM agents. This dataset emulates the structured reasoning process of human reviewers-summarizing the paper, referencing relevant works, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and generating a review conclusion. Building upon this, we train LLM reviewer agents capable of structured reasoning using a relevant-paper-aware training method. Furthermore, we construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to enhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose ReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs. Our experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs exhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there remains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews. Moreover, our ReviewAgents framework further narrows this gap, outperforming advanced LLMs in generating review comments.

  This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

  User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

  Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

  Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.

  This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150 planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

  Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a 7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both approaches and the importance of combining them.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available atthis https URL.
