- **[Quantitative evaluation of brain-inspired vision sensors in high-speed robotic perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19253)**  `arXiv:2504.19253`  `cs.RO` `cs.CV`

  Perception systems in robotics encounter significant challenges in high-speed and dynamic conditions when relying on traditional cameras, where motion blur can compromise spatial feature integrity and task performance. Brain-inspired vision sensors (BVS) have recently gained attention as an alternative, offering high temporal resolution with reduced bandwidth and power requirements. Here, we present the first quantitative evaluation framework for two representative classes of BVSs in variable-speed robotic sensing, including event-based vision sensors (EVS) that detect asynchronous temporal contrasts, and the primitive-based sensor Tianmouc that employs a complementary mechanism to encode both spatiotemporal changes and intensity. A unified testing protocol is established, including crosssensor calibrations, standardized testing platforms, and quality metrics to address differences in data modality. From an imaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as motion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For functional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and motion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS performs well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex scenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings due to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In comparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and complex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise, high-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable insights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and support further advancement in this area.

- **[Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models: Optimizing Speed and Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19645)**  `arXiv:2502.19645`  `cs.RO` `cs.AI` `cs.CV` `cs.LG`

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent vision-language-action models (VLAs) build upon pretrained vision-language models and leverage diverse robot datasets to demonstrate strong task execution, language following ability, and semantic generalization. Despite these successes, VLAs struggle with novel robot setups and require fine-tuning to achieve good performance, yet how to most effectively fine-tune them is unclear given many possible strategies. In this work, we study key VLA adaptation design choices such as different action decoding schemes, action representations, and learning objectives for fine-tuning, using OpenVLA as our representative base model. Our empirical analysis informs an Optimized Fine-Tuning (OFT) recipe that integrates parallel decoding, action chunking, a continuous action representation, and a simple L1 regression-based learning objective to altogether improve inference efficiency, policy performance, and flexibility in the model's input-output specifications. We propose OpenVLA-OFT, an instantiation of this recipe, which sets a new state of the art on the LIBERO simulation benchmark, significantly boosting OpenVLA's average success rate across four task suites from 76.5% to 97.1% while increasing action generation throughput by 26$\times$. In real-world evaluations, our fine-tuning recipe enables OpenVLA to successfully execute dexterous, high-frequency control tasks on a bimanual ALOHA robot and outperform other VLAs ($\pi_0$ and RDT-1B) fine-tuned using their default recipes, as well as strong imitation learning policies trained from scratch (Diffusion Policy and ACT) by up to 15% (absolute) in average success rate. We release code for OFT and pretrained model checkpoints atthis https URL.

- **[On Solving the Dynamics of Constrained Rigid Multi-Body Systems with Kinematic Loops](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19771)**  `arXiv:2504.19771`  `cs.RO`  
  _Vassilios Tsounis, Ruben Grandia, Moritz B√§cher_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This technical report provides an in-depth evaluation of both established and state-of-the-art methods for simulating constrained rigid multi-body systems with hard-contact dynamics, using formulations of Nonlinear Complementarity Problems (NCPs). We are particularly interest in examining the simulation of highly coupled mechanical systems with multitudes of closed-loop bilateral kinematic joint constraints in the presence of additional unilateral constraints such as joint limits and frictional contacts with restitutive impacts. This work thus presents an up-to-date literature survey of the relevant fields, as well as an in-depth description of the approaches used for the formulation and solving of the numerical time-integration problem in a maximal coordinate setting. More specifically, our focus lies on a version of the overall problem that decomposes it into the forward dynamics problem followed by a time-integration using the states of the bodies and the constraint reactions rendered by the former. We then proceed to elaborate on the formulations used to model frictional contact dynamics and define a set of solvers that are representative of those currently employed in the majority of the established physics engines. A key aspect of this work is the definition of a benchmarking framework that we propose as a means to both qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the performance envelopes of the set of solvers on a diverse set of challenging simulation scenarios. We thus present an extensive set of experiments that aim at highlighting the absolute and relative performance of all solvers on particular problems of interest as well as aggravatingly over the complete set defined in the suite.

- **[GPA-RAM: Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba for Spatial Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19683)**  `arXiv:2504.19683`  `cs.RO`  
  _Juyi Sheng, Yangjun Liu, Sheng Xu, Zhixin Yang, Mengyuan Liu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by enhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40\% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

- **[A Time-dependent Risk-aware distributed Multi-Agent Path Finder based on A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19593)**  `arXiv:2504.19593`  `cs.RO`  
  _S Nordstr√∂m, Y Bai, B Lindqvist, G Nikolakopoulos_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) focuses on the collaborative planning of paths for multiple agents within shared spaces, aiming for collision-free navigation. Conventional planning methods often overlook the presence of other agents, which can result in conflicts. In response, this article introduces the A$^*_+$T algorithm, a distributed approach that improves coordination among agents by anticipating their positions based on their movement speeds. The algorithm also considers dynamic obstacles, assessing potential collisions with respect to observed speeds and trajectories, thereby facilitating collision-free path planning in environments populated by other agents and moving objects. It incorporates a risk layer surrounding both dynamic and static entities, enhancing its utility in real-world applications. Each agent functions autonomously while being mindful of the paths chosen by others, effectively addressing the complexities inherent in multi-agent situations. The performance of A$^*_+$T has been rigorously tested in the Gazebo simulation environment and benchmarked against established approaches such as CBS, ECBS, and SIPP. Furthermore, the algorithm has shown competence in single-agent experiments, with results demonstrating its effectiveness in managing dynamic obstacles and affirming its practical relevance across various scenarios.

- **[Smart Placement, Faster Robots -- A Comparison of Algorithms for Robot Base-Pose Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19577)**  `arXiv:2504.19577`  `cs.RO`  
  _Matthias Mayer, Matthias Althoff_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic automation is a key technology that increases the efficiency and flexibility of manufacturing processes. However, one of the challenges in deploying robots in novel environments is finding the optimal base pose for the robot, which affects its reachability and deployment cost. Yet, the existing research for automatically optimizing the base pose of robots has not been compared. We address this problem by optimizing the base pose of industrial robots with Bayesian optimization, exhaustive search, genetic algorithms, and stochastic gradient descent and find that all algorithms can reduce the cycle time for various evaluated tasks in synthetic and real-world environments. Stochastic gradient descent shows superior performance with regard to success rate solving over 90% of our real-world tasks, while genetic algorithms show the lowest final costs. All benchmarks and implemented methods are available as baselines against which novel approaches can be compared.

- **[MISO: Multiresolution Submap Optimization for Efficient Globally Consistent Neural Implicit Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19104)**  `arXiv:2504.19104`  `cs.RO`  
  _Yulun Tian, Hanwen Cao, Sunghwan Kim, Nikolay Atanasov_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit representations have had a significant impact on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) by enabling robots to build continuous, differentiable, and high-fidelity 3D maps from sensor data. However, as the scale and complexity of the environment increase, neural SLAM approaches face renewed challenges in the back-end optimization process to keep up with runtime requirements and maintain global consistency. We introduce MISO, a hierarchical optimization approach that leverages multiresolution submaps to achieve efficient and scalable neural implicit reconstruction. For local SLAM within each submap, we develop a hierarchical optimization scheme with learned initialization that substantially reduces the time needed to optimize the implicit submap features. To correct estimation drift globally, we develop a hierarchical method to align and fuse the multiresolution submaps, leading to substantial acceleration by avoiding the need to decode the full scene geometry. MISO significantly improves computational efficiency and estimation accuracy of neural signed distance function (SDF) SLAM on large-scale real-world benchmarks.

  _Zishen Wan, Jiayi Qian, Yuhang Du, Jason Jabbour, Yilun Du, Yang Katie Zhao, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Embodied systems, where generative autonomous agents engage with the physical world through integrated perception, cognition, action, and advanced reasoning powered by large language models (LLMs), hold immense potential for addressing complex, long-horizon, multi-objective tasks in real-world environments. However, deploying these systems remains challenging due to prolonged runtime latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity, leading to significant system inefficiencies.In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics of embodied agent systems and explore optimization solutions. We systematically categorize these systems into four paradigms and conduct benchmarking studies to evaluate their task performance and system efficiency across various modules, agent scales, and embodied tasks. Our benchmarking studies uncover critical challenges, such as prolonged planning and communication latency, redundant agent interactions, complex low-level control mechanisms, memory inconsistencies, exploding prompt lengths, sensitivity to self-correction and execution, sharp declines in success rates, and reduced collaboration efficiency as agent numbers increase. Leveraging these profiling insights, we suggest system optimization strategies to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of embodied agents across different paradigms. This paper presents the first system-level analysis of embodied AI agents, and explores opportunities for advancing future embodied system design.

- **[Demonstrating DVS: Dynamic Virtual-Real Simulation Platform for Mobile Robotic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18944)**  `arXiv:2504.18944`  `cs.RO`  
  _Zijie Zheng, Zeshun Li, Yunpeng Wang, Qinghongbing Xie, Long Zeng_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of embodied artificial intelligence, robotic research has increasingly focused on complex tasks. Existing simulation platforms, however, are often limited to idealized environments, simple task scenarios and lack data interoperability. This restricts task decomposition and multi-task learning. Additionally, current simulation platforms face challenges in dynamic pedestrian modeling, scene editability, and synchronization between virtual and real assets. These limitations hinder real world robot deployment and feedback. To address these challenges, we propose DVS (Dynamic Virtual-Real Simulation Platform), a platform for dynamic virtual-real synchronization in mobile robotic tasks. DVS integrates a random pedestrian behavior modeling plugin and large-scale, customizable indoor scenes for generating annotated training datasets. It features an optical motion capture system, synchronizing object poses and coordinates between virtual and real world to support dynamic task benchmarking. Experimental validation shows that DVS supports tasks such as pedestrian trajectory prediction, robot path planning, and robotic arm grasping, with potential for both simulation and real world deployment. In this way, DVS represents more than just a versatile robotic platform; it paves the way for research in human intervention in robot execution tasks and real-time feedback algorithms in virtual-real fusion environments. More information about the simulation platform is available onthis https URL.

- **[RoboVerse: Towards a Unified Platform, Dataset and Benchmark for Scalable and Generalizable Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18904)**  `arXiv:2504.18904`  `cs.RO`  
  _Haoran Geng, Feishi Wang, Songlin Wei, Yuyang Li, Bangjun Wang, Boshi An, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data scaling and standardized evaluation benchmarks have driven significant advances in natural language processing and computer vision. However, robotics faces unique challenges in scaling data and establishing evaluation protocols. Collecting real-world data is resource-intensive and inefficient, while benchmarking in real-world scenarios remains highly complex. Synthetic data and simulation offer promising alternatives, yet existing efforts often fall short in data quality, diversity, and benchmark standardization. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a simulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our simulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments, enabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic dataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is constructed through multiple approaches. Additionally, we propose unified benchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling evaluation across different levels of generalization. At the core of the simulation platform is MetaSim, an infrastructure that abstracts diverse simulation environments into a universal interface. It restructures existing simulation environments into a simulator-agnostic configuration system, as well as an API aligning different simulator functionalities, such as launching simulation environments, loading assets with initial states, stepping the physics engine, etc. This abstraction ensures interoperability and extensibility. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RoboVerse enhances the performance of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, world model learning, and sim-to-real transfer. These results validate the reliability of our dataset and benchmarks, establishing RoboVerse as a robust solution for advancing robot learning.

- **[Coherence-based Approximate Derivatives via Web of Affine Spaces Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18790)**  `arXiv:2504.18790`  `cs.RO`  
  _Daniel Rakita, Chen Liang, Qian Wang_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computing derivatives is a crucial subroutine in computer science and related fields as it provides a local characterization of a function's steepest directions of ascent or descent. In this work, we recognize that derivatives are often not computed in isolation; conversely, it is quite common to compute a \textit{sequence} of derivatives, each one somewhat related to the last. Thus, we propose accelerating derivative computation by reusing information from previous, related calculations-a general strategy known as \textit{coherence}. We introduce the first instantiation of this strategy through a novel approach called the Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) Optimization. This approach provides an accurate approximation of a function's derivative object (i.e. gradient, Jacobian matrix, etc.) at the current input within a sequence. Each derivative within the sequence only requires a small number of forward passes through the function (typically two), regardless of the number of function inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through several numerical experiments, comparing it with alternative derivative computation methods on benchmark functions. We show that our method significantly improves the performance of derivative computation on small to medium-sized functions, i.e., functions with approximately fewer than 500 combined inputs and outputs. Furthermore, we show that this method can be effectively applied in a robotics optimization context. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and implications of our work.

- **[Verti-Bench: A General and Scalable Off-Road Mobility Benchmark for Vertically Challenging Terrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11426)**  `arXiv:2502.11426`  `cs.RO`  
  _Tong Xu, Chenhui Pan, Madhan B. Rao, Aniket Datar, Anuj Pokhrel, Yuanjie Lu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancement in off-road autonomy has shown promises in deploying autonomous mobile robots in outdoor off-road environments. Encouraging results have been reported from both simulated and real-world experiments. However, unlike evaluating off-road perception tasks on static datasets, benchmarking off-road mobility still faces significant challenges due to a variety of factors, including variations in vehicle platforms and terrain properties. Furthermore, different vehicle-terrain interactions need to be unfolded during mobility evaluation, which requires the mobility systems to interact with the environments instead of comparing against a pre-collected dataset. In this paper, we present Verti-Bench, a mobility benchmark that focuses on extremely rugged, vertically challenging off-road environments. 100 unique off-road environments and 1000 distinct navigation tasks with millions of off-road terrain properties, including a variety of geometry and semantics, rigid and deformable surfaces, and large natural obstacles, provide standardized and objective evaluation in high-fidelity multi-physics simulation. Verti-Bench is also scalable to various vehicle platforms with different scales and actuation mechanisms. We also provide datasets from expert demonstration, random exploration, failure cases (rolling over and getting stuck), as well as a gym-like interface for reinforcement learning. We use Verti-Bench to benchmark ten off-road mobility systems, present our findings, and identify future off-road mobility research directions.

- **[REASSEMBLE: A Multimodal Dataset for Contact-rich Robotic Assembly and Disassembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05086)**  `arXiv:2502.05086`  `cs.RO`  
  _Daniel Sliwowski, Shail Jadav, Sergej Stanovcic, Jedrzej Orbik, Johannes Heidersberger, Dongheui Lee_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation remains a core challenge in robotics, particularly for contact-rich tasks such as industrial assembly and disassembly. Existing datasets have significantly advanced learning in manipulation but are primarily focused on simpler tasks like object rearrangement, falling short of capturing the complexity and physical dynamics involved in assembly and disassembly. To bridge this gap, we present REASSEMBLE (Robotic assEmbly disASSEMBLy datasEt), a new dataset designed specifically for contact-rich manipulation tasks. Built around the NIST Assembly Task Board 1 benchmark, REASSEMBLE includes four actions (pick, insert, remove, and place) involving 17 objects. The dataset contains 4,551 demonstrations, of which 4,035 were successful, spanning a total of 781 minutes. Our dataset features multi-modal sensor data, including event cameras, force-torque sensors, microphones, and multi-view RGB cameras. This diverse dataset supports research in areas such as learning contact-rich manipulation, task condition identification, action segmentation, and task inversion learning. The REASSEMBLE will be a valuable resource for advancing robotic manipulation in complex, real-world scenarios. The dataset is publicly available on our project website:this https URL.

- **[A prototype-based model for set classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13720)**  `arXiv:2408.13720`  `cs.LG` `cs.CV`  
  _Mohammad Mohammadi, Sreejita Ghosh_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Classification of sets of inputs (e.g., images and texts) is an active area of research within both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). A common way to represent a set of vectors is to model them as linear subspaces. In this contribution, we present a prototype-based approach for learning on the manifold formed from such linear subspaces, the Grassmann manifold. Our proposed method learns a set of subspace prototypes capturing the representative characteristics of classes and a set of relevance factors automating the selection of the dimensionality of the subspaces. This leads to a transparent classifier model which presents the computed impact of each input vector on its decision. Through experiments on benchmark image and text datasets, we have demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed classifier, compared to the transformer-based models in terms of not only performance and explainability but also computational resource requirements.

- **[ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21465)**  `arXiv:2410.21465`  `cs.LG` `cs.CL`  
  _Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, et al._
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

  _Giovanni Catalani, Michael Bauerheim, Fr√©d√©ric Tost, Xavier Bertrand, Joseph Morlier_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful, discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries. Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and capture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with global parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus efficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging the inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is able to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape variations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive experiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material benchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art graph based, operator learning, and neural field methods. Notably, our method supports real time inference and zero-shot super-resolution, enabling efficient training on low-resolution meshes while maintaining high accuracy on full-scale discretizations.

- **[Improving Reasoning Performance in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19483)**  `arXiv:2504.19483`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI` `cs.CL`  
  _Bertram H√∏jer, Oliver Jarvis, Stefan Heinrich_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason. Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.

- **[TSRM: A Lightweight Temporal Feature Encoding Architecture for Time Series Forecasting and Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18878)**  `arXiv:2504.18878`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Robert Leppich, Michael Stenger, Daniel Grillmeyer, Vanessa Borst, Samuel Kounev_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a temporal feature encoding architecture called Time Series Representation Model (TSRM) for multivariate time series forecasting and imputation. The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core. The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is available atthis https URL.

- **[TLoRA: Tri-Matrix Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18735)**  `arXiv:2504.18735`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Tanvir Islam_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method that decomposes weight updates into three matrices: two fixed random matrices and one trainable matrix, combined with a learnable, layer-wise scaling factor. This tri-matrix design enables TLoRA to achieve highly efficient parameter adaptation while introducing minimal additional computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate that TLoRA achieves comparable performance to existing low-rank methods such as LoRA and Adapter-based techniques, while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters. Analyzing the adaptation dynamics, we observe that TLoRA exhibits Gaussian-like weight distributions, stable parameter norms, and scaling factor variability across layers, further highlighting its expressive power and adaptability. Additionally, we show that TLoRA closely resembles LoRA in its eigenvalue distributions, parameter norms, and cosine similarity of updates, underscoring its ability to effectively approximate LoRA's adaptation behavior. Our results establish TLoRA as a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning method for LLMs, offering a significant step forward in resource-efficient model adaptation.

- **[EnviroPiNet: A Physics-Guided AI Model for Predicting Biofilter Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18595)**  `arXiv:2504.18595`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Uzma, Fabien Cholet, Domenic Quinn, Cindy Smith, Siming You, William Sloan_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Environmental biotechnologies, such as drinking water biofilters, rely on complex interactions between microbial communities and their surrounding physical-chemical environments. Predicting the performance of these systems is challenging due to high-dimensional, sparse datasets that lack diversity and fail to fully capture system behaviour. Accurate predictive models require innovative, science-guided approaches. In this study, we present the first application of Buckingham Pi theory to modelling biofilter performance. This dimensionality reduction technique identifies meaningful, dimensionless variables that enhance predictive accuracy and improve model interpretability. Using these variables, we developed the Environmental Buckingham Pi Neural Network (EnviroPiNet), a physics-guided model benchmarked against traditional data-driven methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoder neural networks. Our findings demonstrate that the EnviroPiNet model achieves an R^2 value of 0.9236 on the testing dataset, significantly outperforming PCA and autoencoder methods. The Buckingham Pi variables also provide insights into the physical and chemical relationships governing biofilter behaviour, with implications for system design and optimization. This study highlights the potential of combining physical principles with AI approaches to model complex environmental systems characterized by sparse, high-dimensional datasets.

- **[Understanding the Skill Gap in Recurrent Language Models: The Role of the Gather-and-Aggregate Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18574)**  `arXiv:2504.18574`  `cs.LG` `cs.AI`  
  _Aviv Bick, Eric Xing, Albert Gu_
  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  SSMs offer efficient processing of long sequences with fixed state sizes, but struggle with algorithmic tasks like retrieving past context. In this work, we examine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and SSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same fundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first identifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an Aggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model types, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks even for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example, disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades its ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy from 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure the limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance with retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar G&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the significance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs manifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns rather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus, while a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context retrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight suggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers and SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example, in pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of Aggregate Heads. Similarly, in a pretrained pure SSM, replacing a single G&A head with an attention-based variant significantly improves retrieval.

  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the preferred models for node classification in graph data due to their robust capabilities in integrating graph structures and attributes. However, these models heavily depend on a substantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often costly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising approach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive knowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either requires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to noisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Locle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node Classification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a careful sample selection scheme to identify "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines LLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Locle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards, as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g., +2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to oversmoothing due to their implicit homophily assumption. We mitigate this problem with a novel scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g., generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on chemoinformatics benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Methods based on implicit neural representation have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) tasks, but they neglect the potential value of the frequency domain, leading to sub-optimal performance. We proposes a novel network called Frequency-Integrated Transformer (FIT) to incorporate and utilize frequency information to enhance ASSR performance. FIT employs Frequency Incorporation Module (FIM) to introduce frequency information in a lossless manner and Frequency Utilization Self-Attention module (FUSAM) to efficiently leverage frequency information by exploiting spatial-frequency interrelationship and global nature of frequency. FIM enriches detail characterization by incorporating frequency information through a combination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with real-imaginary mapping. In FUSAM, Interaction Implicit Self-Attention (IISA) achieves cross-domain information synergy by interacting spatial and frequency information in subspace, while Frequency Correlation Self-attention (FCSA) captures the global context by computing correlation in frequency. Experimental results demonstrate FIT yields superior performance compared to existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Visual feature map proves the superiority of FIM in enriching detail characterization. Frequency error map validates IISA productively improve the frequency fidelity. Local attribution map validates FCSA effectively captures global context.

  Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead by selectively processing a subset of salient tokens while preserving model performance. Despite the effectiveness of such designs, how to actively encourage token sparsity of well-posed MLLMs remains under-explored, which fundamentally limits the achievable acceleration effect during inference. In this paper, we propose a simple RL-based post-training method named \textbf{ZipR1} that treats the token reduction ratio as the efficiency reward and answer accuracy as the performance reward.In this way, our method can jointly alleviate the computation and memory bottlenecks via directly optimizing the inference-consistent efficiency-performance tradeoff. Experimental results demonstrate that ZipR1 can reduce the token ratio of Qwen2/2.5-VL from 80\% to 25\% with a minimal accuracy reduction on 13 image and video benchmarks.

  Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various tasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In safety-critical applications, guaranteeing the satisfaction of constraints over continuous environments is crucial, e.g., an autonomous agent should never crash into obstacles or go off-road. Neural models struggle in the presence of these constraints, especially when they involve intricate algebraic relationships. To address this, we introduce a differentiable probabilistic layer that guarantees the satisfaction of non-convex algebraic constraints over continuous variables. This probabilistic algebraic layer (PAL) can be seamlessly plugged into any neural architecture and trained via maximum likelihood without requiring approximations. PAL defines a distribution over conjunctions and disjunctions of linear inequalities, parameterized by polynomials. This formulation enables efficient and exact renormalization via symbolic integration, which can be amortized across different data points and easily parallelized on a GPU. We showcase PAL and our integration scheme on a number of benchmarks for algebraic constraint integration and on real-world trajectory data.

  Cybersecurity threats are growing, making network intrusion detection essential. Traditional machine learning models remain effective in resource-limited environments due to their efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and less computational time. However, handling short and highly imbalanced datasets remains challenging. In this study, we propose the fusion of a Contrastive Attentive Graph Network and Graph Attention Network (CAGN-GAT Fusion) and benchmark it against 15 other models, including both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models. Our evaluation is conducted on four benchmark datasets (KDD-CUP-1999, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017) using a short and proportionally imbalanced dataset with a constant size of 5000 samples to ensure fairness in comparison. Results show that CAGN-GAT Fusion demonstrates stable and competitive accuracy, recall, and F1-score, even though it does not achieve the highest performance in every dataset. Our analysis also highlights the impact of adaptive graph construction techniques, including small changes in connections (edge perturbation) and selective hiding of features (feature masking), improving detection performance. The findings confirm that GNNs, particularly CAGN-GAT Fusion, are robust and computationally efficient, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. Future work will explore GraphSAGE layers and multiview graph construction techniques to further enhance adaptability and detection accuracy.

  Although existing 3D perception algorithms have demonstrated significant improvements in performance, their deployment on edge devices continues to encounter critical challenges due to substantial runtime latency. We propose a new benchmark tailored for online evaluation by considering runtime latency. Based on the benchmark, we build a Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception (LASP) framework that addresses the latency issue through two primary components: 1) latency-aware history integration, which extends query propagation into a continuous process, ensuring the integration of historical feature regardless of varying latency; 2) latency-aware predictive detection, a module that compensates the detection results with the predicted trajectory and the posterior accessed latency. By incorporating the latency-aware mechanism, our method shows generalization across various latency levels, achieving an online performance that closely aligns with 80\% of its offline evaluation on the Jetson AGX Orin without any acceleration techniques.

  Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While modern visual recognition systems have made significant advancements, many continue to struggle with the open problem of learning from few exemplars. This paper focuses on the task of object detection in the setting where object classes follow a natural long-tailed distribution. Existing methods for long-tailed detection resort to external ImageNet labels to augment the low-shot training instances. However, such dependency on a large labeled database has limited utility in practical scenarios. We propose a versatile and scalable approach to leverage optional unlabeled images, which are easy to collect without the burden of human annotations. Our SimLTD framework is straightforward and intuitive, and consists of three simple steps: (1) pre-training on abundant head classes; (2) transfer learning on scarce tail classes; and (3) fine-tuning on a sampled set of both head and tail classes. Our approach can be viewed as an improved head-to-tail model transfer paradigm without the added complexities of meta-learning or knowledge distillation, as was required in past research. By harnessing supplementary unlabeled images, without extra image labels, SimLTD establishes new record results on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark across both supervised and semi-supervised settings.

  Despite the impressive text-to-image (T2I) synthesis capabilities of diffusion models, they often struggle to understand compositional relationships between objects and attributes, especially in complex settings. Existing solutions have tackled these challenges by optimizing the cross-attention mechanism or learning from the caption pairs with minimal semantic changes. However, can we generate high-quality complex contrastive images that diffusion models can directly discriminate based on visual representations? In this work, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to compose realistic, complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) systems alongside diffusion models to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases, i.e., hard negative images, we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks.

  Multi-view understanding, the ability to reconcile visual information across diverse viewpoints for effective navigation, manipulation, and 3D scene comprehension, is a fundamental challenge in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to be used as embodied agents. While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding.

Here, we present ConceptCLIP, the first explainable biomedical foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy while delivering human-interpretable explanations across diverse imaging modalities. We curate MedConcept-23M, the largest pre-training dataset comprising 23 million image-text-concept triplets across diverse medical modalities, where clinical concepts are derived from the Unified Medical Language System. Leveraging this dataset, we develop ConceptCLIP through a novel dual-alignment approach that simultaneously learns global image-text representations and fine-grained region-concept associations for precise and interpretable medical image analysis. We curate the most extensive evaluation benchmark for multimodal biomedical foundation models, covering 52 clinical tasks spanning 10 imaging modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptCLIP outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal biomedical foundation models. Importantly, ConceptCLIP demonstrates superior diagnostic performance while providing human-understandable explanations validated by clinical experts. As the first precise and interpretable biomedical foundation model, ConceptCLIP represents a critical milestone toward the widespread clinical adoption of AI, thereby advancing trustworthy AI in medicine.

  Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

In this work, we focus on summarizing instructional videos and propose a method for breaking down a video into meaningful segments, each corresponding to essential steps in the video. We propose \textbf{HierSum}, a hierarchical approach that integrates fine-grained local cues from subtitles with global contextual information provided by video-level instructions. Our approach utilizes the ``most replayed" statistic as a supervisory signal to identify critical segments, thereby improving the effectiveness of the summary. We evaluate on benchmark datasets such as TVSum, BLiSS,this http URL, and the WikiHow test set, and show that HierSum consistently outperforms existing methods in key metrics such as F1-score and rank correlation. We also curate a new multi-modal dataset using WikiHow and EHow videos and associated articles containing step-by-step instructions. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that training on this dataset significantly enhances summarization on the target datasets.

  Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy.

  This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed $\textbf{Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD)}$. Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs.

  In this work, we introduce Segmentation to Human-Object Interaction (\textit{\textbf{Seg2HOI}}) approach, a novel framework that integrates segmentation-based vision foundation models with the human-object interaction task, distinguished from traditional detection-based Human-Object Interaction (HOI) methods. Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically, Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g., promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.

  Satellite imagery and maps, as two fundamental data modalities in remote sensing, offer direct observations of the Earth's surface and human-interpretable geographic abstractions, respectively. The task of bidirectional translation between satellite images and maps (BSMT) holds significant potential for applications in urban planning and disaster response. However, this task presents two major challenges: first, the absence of precise pixel-wise alignment between the two modalities substantially complicates the translation process; second, it requires achieving both high-level abstraction of geographic features and high-quality visual synthesis, which further elevates the technical complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce EarthMapper, a novel autoregressive framework for controllable bidirectional satellite-map translation. EarthMapper employs geographic coordinate embeddings to anchor generation, ensuring region-specific adaptability, and leverages multi-scale feature alignment within a geo-conditioned joint scale autoregression (GJSA) process to unify bidirectional translation in a single training cycle. A semantic infusion (SI) mechanism is introduced to enhance feature-level consistency, while a key point adaptive guidance (KPAG) mechanism is proposed to dynamically balance diversity and precision during inference. We further contribute CNSatMap, a large-scale dataset comprising 302,132 precisely aligned satellite-map pairs across 38 Chinese cities, enabling robust benchmarking. Extensive experiments on CNSatMap and the New York dataset demonstrate EarthMapper's superior performance, achieving significant improvements in visual realism, semantic consistency, and structural fidelity over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, EarthMapper excels in zero-shot tasks like in-painting, out-painting and coordinate-conditional generation, underscoring its versatility.

  Text-to-image generative models often struggle with long prompts detailing complex scenes, diverse objects with distinct visual characteristics and spatial relationships. In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of up to +4% in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 85% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.

  We address the problem of semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG), where the distributions of train and test data differ, and only a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data are available during training. Existing SSDG methods that leverage only the unlabeled samples for which the model's predictions are highly confident (confident-unlabeled samples), limit the full utilization of the available unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore a method for incorporating the unconfident-unlabeled samples that were previously disregarded in SSDG setting. To this end, we propose UPCSC to utilize these unconfident-unlabeled samples in SSDG that consists of two modules: 1) Unlabeled Proxy-based Contrastive learning (UPC) module, treating unconfident-unlabeled samples as additional negative pairs and 2) Surrogate Class learning (SC) module, generating positive pairs for unconfident-unlabeled samples using their confusing class set. These modules are plug-and-play and do not require any domain labels, which can be easily integrated into existing approaches. Experiments on four widely used SSDG benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance when attached to baselines and outperforms competing plug-and-play methods. We also analyze the role of our method in SSDG, showing that it enhances class-level discriminability and mitigates domain gaps. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stereo video synthesis from a monocular input is a demanding task in the fields of spatial computing and virtual reality. The main challenges of this task lie on the insufficiency of high-quality paired stereo videos for training and the difficulty of maintaining the spatio-temporal consistency between frames. Existing methods primarily address these issues by directly applying novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques to video, while facing limitations such as the inability to effectively represent dynamic scenes and the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised stereo video synthesis paradigm via a video diffusion model, termed SpatialDreamer, which meets the challenges head-on. Firstly, to address the stereo video data insufficiency, we propose a Depth based Video Generation module DVG, which employs a forward-backward rendering mechanism to generate paired videos with geometric and temporal priors. Leveraging data generated by DVG, we propose RefinerNet along with a self-supervised synthetic framework designed to facilitate efficient and dedicated training. More importantly, we devise a consistency control module, which consists of a metric of stereo deviation strength and a Temporal Interaction Learning module TIL for geometric and temporal consistency ensurance respectively. We evaluated the proposed method against various benchmark methods, with the results showcasing its superior performance.

  Current semantic segmentation models typically require a substantial amount of manually annotated data, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.

  Recent methods for human image completion can reconstruct plausible body shapes but often fail to preserve unique details, such as specific clothing patterns or distinctive accessories, without explicit reference images. Even state-of-the-art reference-based inpainting approaches struggle to accurately capture and integrate fine-grained details from reference images. To address this limitation, we propose CompleteMe, a novel reference-based human image completion framework. CompleteMe employs a dual U-Net architecture combined with a Region-focused Attention (RFA) Block, which explicitly guides the model's attention toward relevant regions in reference images. This approach effectively captures fine details and ensures accurate semantic correspondence, significantly improving the fidelity and consistency of completed images. Additionally, we introduce a challenging benchmark specifically designed for evaluating reference-based human image completion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior visual quality and semantic consistency compared to existing techniques. Project page:this https URL

  This paper proposes an Incremental Learning (IL) approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in analyzing T2-weighted (T2w) MRI medical images prostate cancer detection using the PI-CAI dataset. We used multiple health centers' artificial intelligence and radiology data, focused on different tasks that looked at prostate cancer detection using MRI (PI-CAI). We utilized Knowledge Distillation (KD), as it employs generated images from past tasks to guide the training of models for subsequent tasks. The approach yielded improved performance and faster convergence of the models. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach, we evaluated it on the PI-CAI dataset, a diverse set of medical imaging modalities including OCT and PathMNIST, and the benchmark continual learning dataset CIFAR-10. Our results indicate that KD can be a promising technique for IL in medical image analysis in which data is sourced from individual health centers and the storage of large datasets is not feasible. By using generated images from prior tasks, our method enables the model to retain and apply previously acquired knowledge without direct access to the original data.

  Recent studies in 3D spatial reasoning explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance with reinforcement learning (RL). However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.

  Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.

  Precise segmentation of out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, herein referred to as anomalies, is crucial for the reliable deployment of semantic segmentation models in open-set, safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving. Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios, highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in $\rm{FPR}_{95}$.

  Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) addresses the challenge of matching face images across different sensing modalities, such as thermal to visible or near-infrared to visible, expanding the applicability of face recognition systems in real-world, unconstrained environments. While recent HFR methods have shown promising results, many rely on computation-intensive architectures, limiting their practicality for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we present a lightweight yet effective HFR framework by adapting a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture originally designed for face recognition. Our approach enables efficient end-to-end training with minimal paired heterogeneous data while preserving strong performance on standard RGB face recognition tasks. This makes it a compelling solution for both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging HFR and face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a low computational overhead.

  Accurate crowd detection (CD) is critical for public safety and historical pattern analysis, yet existing methods relying on ground and aerial imagery suffer from limited spatio-temporal coverage. The development of very-fine-resolution (VFR) satellite sensor imagery (e.g., ~0.3 m spatial resolution) provides unprecedented opportunities for large-scale crowd activity analysis, but it has never been considered for this task. To address this gap, we proposed CrowdSat-Net, a novel point-based convolutional neural network, which features two innovative components: Dual-Context Progressive Attention Network (DCPAN) to improve feature representation of individuals by aggregating scene context and local individual characteristics, and High-Frequency Guided Deformable Upsampler (HFGDU) that recovers high-frequency information during upsampling through frequency-domain guided deformable convolutions. To validate the effectiveness of CrowdSat-Net, we developed CrowdSat, the first VFR satellite imagery dataset designed specifically for CD tasks, comprising over 120k manually labeled individuals from multi-source satellite platforms (Beijing-3N, Jilin-1 Gaofen-04A and Google Earth) across China. In the experiments, CrowdSat-Net was compared with five state-of-the-art point-based CD methods (originally designed for ground or aerial imagery) using CrowdSat and achieved the largest F1-score of 66.12% and Precision of 73.23%, surpassing the second-best method by 1.71% and 2.42%, respectively. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments validated the importance of the DCPAN and HFGDU modules. Furthermore, cross-regional evaluation further demonstrated the spatial generalizability of CrowdSat-Net. This research advances CD capability by providing both a newly developed network architecture for CD and a pioneering benchmark dataset to facilitate future CD development.

  Figure skating, known as the "Art on Ice," is among the most artistic sports, challenging to understand due to its blend of technical elements (like jumps and spins) and overall artistic expression. Existing figure skating datasets mainly focus on single tasks, such as action recognition or scoring, lacking comprehensive annotations for both technical and artistic evaluation. Current sports research is largely centered on ball games, with limited relevance to artistic sports like figure skating. To address this, we introduce FSAnno, a large-scale dataset advancing artistic sports understanding through figure skating. FSAnno includes an open-access training and test dataset, alongside a benchmark dataset, FSBench, for fair model evaluation. FSBench consists of FSBench-Text, with multiple-choice questions and explanations, and FSBench-Motion, containing multimodal data and Question and Answer (QA) pairs, supporting tasks from technical analysis to performance commentary. Initial tests on FSBench reveal significant limitations in existing models' understanding of artistic sports. We hope FSBench will become a key tool for evaluating and enhancing model comprehension of figure skating.

  The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has driven remarkable progress in low-light image enhancement (LLIE), with diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs and Transformers) and color spaces (e.g., sRGB, HSV, HVI) yielding impressive results. Recent efforts have sought to leverage the complementary strengths of these paradigms, offering promising solutions to enhance performance across varying degradation scenarios. However, existing fusion strategies are hindered by challenges such as parameter explosion, optimization instability, and feature misalignment, limiting further improvements. To overcome these issues, we introduce FusionNet, a novel multi-model linear fusion framework that operates in parallel to effectively capture global and local features across diverse color spaces. By incorporating a linear fusion strategy underpinned by Hilbert space theoretical guarantees, FusionNet mitigates network collapse and reduces excessive training costs. Our method achieved 1st place in the CVPR2025 NTIRE Low Light Enhancement Challenge. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results, delivering robust enhancement under diverse low-light conditions.

  Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents significant challenges due to the high dimensionality, spectral redundancy, and limited labeled data typically available in real-world applications. To address these issues and optimize classification performance, we propose a novel band selection strategy known as Iterative Wavelet-based Gradient Sampling (IWGS). This method incrementally selects the most informative spectral bands by analyzing gradients within the wavelet-transformed domain, enabling efficient and targeted dimensionality reduction. Unlike traditional selection methods, IWGS leverages the multi-resolution properties of wavelets to better capture subtle spectral variations relevant for classification. The iterative nature of the approach ensures that redundant or noisy bands are systematically excluded while maximizing the retention of discriminative features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark HSI datasets: Houston 2013 and Indian Pines. Results demonstrate that IWGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art band selection and classification techniques in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. These improvements make our method especially suitable for deployment in edge devices or other resource-constrained environments, where memory and processing power are limited. In particular, IWGS achieved an overall accuracy up to 97.8% on Indian Pines for selected classes, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability across different HSI scenarios.

  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for interpreting object detection models remain in an early stage, with no established standards for systematic evaluation. This absence of consensus hinders both the comparative analysis of methods and the informed selection of suitable approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Object Detection Explainable AI Evaluation (ODExAI), a comprehensive framework designed to assess XAI methods in object detection based on three core dimensions: localization accuracy, faithfulness to model behavior, and computational complexity. We benchmark a set of XAI methods across two widely used object detectors (YOLOX and Faster R-CNN) and standard datasets (MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC). Empirical results demonstrate that region-based methods (e.g., D-CLOSE) achieve strong localization (PG = 88.49%) and high model faithfulness (OA = 0.863), though with substantial computational overhead (Time = 71.42s). On the other hand, CAM-based methods (e.g., G-CAME) achieve superior localization (PG = 96.13%) and significantly lower runtime (Time = 0.54s), but at the expense of reduced faithfulness (OA = 0.549). These findings demonstrate critical trade-offs among existing XAI approaches and reinforce the need for task-specific evaluation when deploying them in object detection pipelines. Our implementation and evaluation benchmarks are publicly available at:this https URL.

  With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However, existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and (2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness (SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the segmentation of objectiveness through a Semantic Fusion Block (SFB) and filters anomalies irrelevant to road navigation tasks using a Scene-understanding Guided Prompt-Context Adaptor (SG-PCA). Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fishyscapes Lost and Found, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and RoadAnomaly, demonstrate that the proposed SOTA consistently improves OOD detection performance across diverse detectors, achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.

  Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train an object detector on a single source domain while generalizing well to diverse unseen target domains, making it suitable for multimedia applications that involve various domain shifts, such as intelligent video surveillance and VR/AR technologies. With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with improvements of +8.8\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\%~mPC on DWD over baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.

  Data augmentation is essential in medical imaging for improving classification accuracy, lesion detection, and organ segmentation under limited data conditions. However, two significant challenges remain. First, a pronounced domain gap between natural photographs and medical images can distort critical disease features. Second, augmentation studies in medical imaging are fragmented and limited to single tasks or architectures, leaving the benefits of advanced mix-based strategies unclear. To address these challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework with six mix-based augmentation methods integrated with both convolutional and transformer backbones on brain tumour MRI and eye disease fundus datasets. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We introduce MediAug, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark for advanced data augmentation in medical imaging. (2) We systematically evaluate MixUp, YOCO, CropMix, CutMix, AugMix, and SnapMix with ResNet-50 and ViT-B backbones. (3) We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MixUp yields the greatest improvement on the brain tumor classification task for ResNet-50 with 79.19% accuracy and SnapMix yields the greatest improvement for ViT-B with 99.44% accuracy, and that YOCO yields the greatest improvement on the eye disease classification task for ResNet-50 with 91.60% accuracy and CutMix yields the greatest improvement for ViT-B with 97.94% accuracy.

  Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN, increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector, and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos. Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments, especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art on three benchmark datasets and shows comparable result for the fourth.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing weakly supervised video violence detection (VVD) methods primarily rely on Euclidean representation learning, which often struggles to distinguish visually similar yet semantically distinct events due to limited hierarchical modeling and insufficient ambiguous training samples. To address this challenge, we propose PiercingEye, a novel dual-space learning framework that synergizes Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, PiercingEye introduces a layer-sensitive hyperbolic aggregation strategy with hyperbolic Dirichlet energy constraints to progressively model event hierarchies, and a cross-space attention mechanism to facilitate complementary feature interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of ambiguous samples, we leverage large language models to generate logic-guided ambiguous event descriptions, enabling explicit supervision through a hyperbolic vision-language contrastive loss that prioritizes high-confusion samples via dynamic similarity-aware weighting. Extensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks demonstrate that PiercingEye achieves state-of-the-art performance, with particularly strong results on a newly curated ambiguous event subset, validating its superior capability in fine-grained violence detection.

  This review provides a systematic analysis of comprehensive survey of 3D object detection with vision-language models(VLMs) , a rapidly advancing area at the intersection of 3D vision and multimodal AI. By examining over 100 research papers, we provide the first systematic analysis dedicated to 3D object detection with vision-language models. We begin by outlining the unique challenges of 3D object detection with vision-language models, emphasizing differences from 2D detection in spatial reasoning and data complexity. Traditional approaches using point clouds and voxel grids are compared to modern vision-language frameworks like CLIP and 3D LLMs, which enable open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot generalization. We review key architectures, pretraining strategies, and prompt engineering methods that align textual and 3D features for effective 3D object detection with vision-language models. Visualization examples and evaluation benchmarks are discussed to illustrate performance and behavior. Finally, we highlight current challenges, such as limited 3D-language datasets and computational demands, and propose future research directions to advance 3D object detection with vision-language models. >Object Detection, Vision-Language Models, Agents, VLMs, LLMs, AI

  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition, captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH, revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM advancements.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.

  In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.

  The Instruction Following (IF) ability measures how well Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) understand exactly what users are telling them and whether they are doing it right. Existing multimodal instruction following training data is scarce, the benchmarks are simple with atomic instructions, and the evaluation strategies are imprecise for tasks demanding exact output constraints. To address this, we present MM-IFEngine, an effective pipeline to generate high-quality image-instruction pairs. Our MM-IFEngine pipeline yields large-scale, diverse, and high-quality training data MM-IFInstruct-23k, which is suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and extended as MM-IFDPO-23k for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We further introduce MM-IFEval, a challenging and diverse multi-modal instruction-following benchmark that includes (1) both compose-level constraints for output responses and perception-level constraints tied to the input images, and (2) a comprehensive evaluation pipeline incorporating both rule-based assessment and judge model. We conduct SFT and DPO experiments and demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs on MM-IFInstruct-23k and MM-IFDPO-23k achieves notable gains on various IF benchmarks, such as MM-IFEval (+10.2$\%$), MIA (+7.6$\%$), and IFEval (+12.3$\%$). We have fully open-sourced the datasets (both SFT and DPO), evaluation code and training scripts atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) seeks to find a target image using a multi-modal query, which combines an image with modification text to pinpoint the target. While recent CIR methods have shown promise, they mainly focus on exploring relationships between the query pairs (image and text) through data augmentation or model design. These methods often assume perfect alignment between queries and target images, an idealized scenario rarely encountered in practice. In reality, pairs are often partially or completely mismatched due to issues like inaccurate modification texts, low-quality target images, and annotation errors. Ignoring these mismatches leads to numerous False Positive Pair (FFPs) denoted as noise pairs in the dataset, causing the model to overfit and ultimately reducing its performance. To address this problem, we propose the Noise-aware Contrastive Learning for CIR (NCL-CIR), comprising two key components: the Weight Compensation Block (WCB) and the Noise-pair Filter Block (NFB). The WCB coupled with diverse weight maps can ensure more stable token representations of multi-modal queries and target images. Meanwhile, the NFB, in conjunction with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) predicts noise pairs by evaluating loss distributions, and generates soft labels correspondingly, allowing for the design of the soft-label based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss function. Consequently, the overall architecture helps to mitigate the influence of mismatched and partially matched samples, with experimental results demonstrating that NCL-CIR achieves exceptional performance on the benchmark datasets.

  The rapid advancement of video generation has rendered existing evaluation systems inadequate for assessing state-of-the-art models, primarily due to simple prompts that cannot showcase the model's capabilities, fixed evaluation operators struggling with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases, and misalignment between computed metrics and human preferences. To bridge the gap, we propose VideoGen-Eval, an agent evaluation system that integrates LLM-based content structuring, MLLM-based content judgment, and patch tools designed for temporal-dense dimensions, to achieve a dynamic, flexible, and expandable video generation evaluation. Additionally, we introduce a video generation benchmark to evaluate existing cutting-edge models and verify the effectiveness of our evaluation system. It comprises 700 structured, content-rich prompts (both T2V and I2V) and over 12,000 videos generated by 20+ models, among them, 8 cutting-edge models are selected as quantitative evaluation for the agent and human. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed agent-based evaluation system demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences and reliably completes the evaluation, as well as the diversity and richness of the benchmark.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advanced token compression techniques, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with hour-long video understanding. In this work, we propose Video-XL-Pro, an efficient method for extremely long video understanding, built upon Reconstructive Compression of Tokens (ReCoT), a learnable module that leverages self-supervised learning to generate comprehensive and compact video tokens. ReCoT introduces two key components: (i) Dynamic Token Synthesizer (DTS): DTS generates pseudo-video tokens from static image tokens by learning intra-token relationships, which are then used in masked video modeling. (ii) Semantic-Guided Masking (SGM): SGM adaptively masks redundant visual tokens to facilitate more effective reconstructive learning. To improve training efficiency in MLLMs fine-tuning, we introduce a video-specific dataset pruning strategy and design a simple yet Query-aware Selector that enables the model to precisely locate query-relevant video tokens. With only 3B parameters, Video-XL-Pro outperforms most 7B models trained on larger datasets across multiple long video understanding benchmarks. Moreover, it can process over 8K frames on a single A100 GPU while maintaining high-quality performance.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the 8-Calves dataset, a benchmark for evaluating object detection and identity preservation in occlusion-rich, temporally consistent environments. Comprising a 1-hour video (67,760 frames) of eight Holstein Friesian calves with unique coat patterns and 900 static frames, the dataset emphasizes real-world challenges like prolonged occlusions, motion blur, and pose variation. By fine-tuning 28 object detectors (YOLO variants, transformers) and evaluating 23 pretrained backbones (ResNet, ConvNextV2, ViTs), we expose critical architectural trade-offs: smaller models (e.g., ConvNextV2 Nano, 15.6M parameters) excel in efficiency and retrieval accuracy, while pure vision transformers lag in occlusion-heavy settings. The dataset's structured design-fixed camera views, natural motion, and verified identities-provides a reproducible testbed for object detection challenges (mAP50:95: 56.5-66.4%), bridging synthetic simplicity and domain-specific complexity. The dataset and benchmark code are all publicly available atthis https URL. Limitations include partial labeling and detector bias, addressed in later sections.

  This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) leverages densely distributed Gaussian primitives for high-quality scene representation and reconstruction. While existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large view changes from cross-view data pose optimization challenges for these methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction based on multi-branch construction and fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from different sets of views as multiple independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of multi-branch into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure physiological signals and Heart Rate (HR) from facial videos. Recent unsupervised rPPG estimation methods have shown promising potential in estimating rPPG signals from facial regions without relying on ground truth rPPG signals. However, these methods seem oblivious to interference existing in rPPG signals and still result in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel De-interfered and Descriptive rPPG Estimation Network (DD-rPPGNet) to eliminate the interference within rPPG features for learning genuine rPPG signals. First, we investigate the characteristics of local spatial-temporal similarities of interference and design a novel unsupervised model to estimate the interference. Next, we propose an unsupervised de-interfered method to learn genuine rPPG signals with two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the initial rPPG signals by contrastive learning from both the training data and their augmented counterparts. In the second stage, we use the estimated interference features to derive de-interfered rPPG features and encourage the rPPG signals to be distinct from the interference. In addition, we propose an effective descriptive rPPG feature learning by developing a strong 3D Learnable Descriptive Convolution (3DLDC) to capture the subtle chrominance changes for enhancing rPPG estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on five rPPG benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DD-rPPGNet outperforms previous unsupervised rPPG estimation methods and achieves competitive performances with state-of-the-art supervised rPPG methods.

  Lane detection has evolved highly functional autonomous driving system to understand driving scenes even under complex environments. In this paper, we work towards developing a generalized computer vision system able to detect lanes without using any annotation. We make the following contributions: (i) We illustrate how to perform unsupervised 3D lane segmentation by leveraging the distinctive intensity of lanes on the LiDAR point cloud frames, and then obtain the noisy lane labels in the 2D plane by projecting the 3D points; (ii) We propose a novel self-supervised training scheme, dubbed LaneCorrect, that automatically corrects the lane label by learning geometric consistency and instance awareness from the adversarial augmentations; (iii) With the self-supervised pre-trained model, we distill to train a student network for arbitrary target lane (e.g., TuSimple) detection without any human labels; (iv) We thoroughly evaluate our self-supervised method on four major lane detection benchmarks (including TuSimple, CULane, CurveLanes and LLAMAS) and demonstrate excellent performance compared with existing supervised counterpart, whilst showing more effective results on alleviating the domain gap, i.e., training on CULane and test on TuSimple.

  Camouflage poses challenges in distinguishing a static target, whereas any movement of the target can break this disguise. Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) approaches take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework for VCOD, dubbed EMIP, which handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow fundamental model. EMIP is characterized by a two-stream architecture for simultaneously conducting camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation. Interactions across the dual streams are realized in an interactive prompting way that is inspired by emerging visual prompt learning. Two learnable modules, i.e., the camouflaged feeder and motion collector, are designed to incorporate segmentation-to-motion and motion-to-segmentation prompts, respectively, and enhance outputs of the both streams. The prompt fed to the motion stream is learned by supervising optical flow in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we show that long-term historical information can also be incorporated as a prompt into EMIP and achieve more robust results with temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our EMIP achieves new state-of-the-art records on popular VCOD benchmarks. Our code is made publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning-based food recognition has made significant progress in predicting food types from eating occasion images. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) continuously learning new food classes without forgetting previously learned ones, and (2) handling the long-tailed distribution of food images, where a few common classes and many more rare classes. To address these, food recognition methods should focus on long-tailed continual learning. In this work, We introduce a dataset that encompasses 186 American foods along with comprehensive annotations. We also introduce three new benchmark datasets, VFN186-LT, VFN186-INSULIN and VFN186-T2D, which reflect real-world food consumption for healthy populations, insulin takers and individuals with type 2 diabetes without taking insulin. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that improves the generalization ability for instance-rare food classes using a knowledge distillation-based predictor to avoid misalignment of representation during continual learning. Additionally, we introduce an augmentation technique by integrating class-activation-map (CAM) and CutMix to improve generalization on instance-rare food classes. Our method, evaluated on Food101-LT, VFN-LT, VFN186-LT, VFN186-INSULIN, and VFN186-T2DM, shows significant improvements over existing methods. An ablation study highlights further performance enhancements, demonstrating its potential for real-world food recognition applications.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce AutoJudge, a framework that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the generated response, relaxing the guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft model should be corrected to preserve quality, and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B (target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more accepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer accuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach automatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows similar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often require extensive fine-tuning and large datasets for specialized domains like law. General-purpose pre-training may not capture legal nuances, and acquiring sufficient legal data is challenging. We introduce SynLexLM, a novel approach to efficiently pre-train a legal LLM. Our method employs curriculum learning, progressing from simple to complex legal texts and queries, combined with synthetic data augmentation using models like Gemini Pro to address data scarcity. We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks (BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting legal reasoning. This work aims to enhance legal document analysis and research tools, potentially democratizing access to advanced legal AI.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models excel at following explicit instructions, but they often struggle with ambiguous or incomplete user requests, defaulting to verbose, generic responses instead of seeking clarification. We introduce InfoQuest, a multi-turn chat benchmark designed to evaluate how dialogue agents handle hidden context in open-ended user requests. This benchmark presents intentionally ambiguous scenarios that require models to engage in information-seeking dialogue by asking clarifying questions before providing appropriate responses. Our evaluation of both open and closed models reveals that, while proprietary models generally perform better, all current assistants struggle to gather critical information effectively. They often require multiple turns to infer user intent and frequently default to generic responses without proper clarification. We provide a systematic methodology for generating diverse scenarios and evaluating models' information-seeking capabilities, which can be leveraged to automatically generate data for self-improvement. We also offer insights into the current limitations of language models in handling ambiguous requests through multi-turn interactions.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination is a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), preventing their further application in some fields. The skeptical thinking of humankind could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hallucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, representing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accuracy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism modeling on further artificial intelligence. Project code and model checkpoints can be found inthis https URL.

  The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art (SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy guardrail models. %On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created, our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA publicly available LLMs and 3$^{\text{rd}}$ party guardrail APIs in detecting unsafe and safe behaviors by an average F1 score improvement of \textbf{29.92} points over Aegis-LlamaGuard and \textbf{21.62} over \texttt{gpt-4o}, respectively.

  Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

  Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming state-of-the-art process reward models.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating the difficulty of a dataset typically involves comparing state-of-the-art models to humans; the bigger the performance gap, the harder the dataset is said to be. However, this comparison provides little understanding of how difficult each instance in a given distribution is, or what attributes make the dataset difficult for a given model. To address these questions, we frame dataset difficulty -- w.r.t. a model $\mathcal{V}$ -- as the lack of $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ (Xu et al., 2019), where a lower value indicates a more difficult dataset for $\mathcal{V}$. We further introduce $\textit{pointwise $\mathcal{V}$-information}$ (PVI) for measuring the difficulty of individual instances w.r.t. a given distribution. While standard evaluation metrics typically only compare different models for the same dataset, $\mathcal{V}$-$\textit{usable information}$ and PVI also permit the converse: for a given model $\mathcal{V}$, we can compare different datasets, as well as different instances/slices of the same dataset. Furthermore, our framework allows for the interpretability of different input attributes via transformations of the input, which we use to discover annotation artefacts in widely-used NLP benchmarks.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace. However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations. Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.

  <details open><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to process and generate coherent context when the number of input tokens exceeds the pre-trained length. Recent advancements in long-context extension have significantly expanded the context window of LLMs but require expensive overhead to train the large-scale models with longer context. In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions. Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension. We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of 128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention 2. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DPE also dramatically improves the models' performance within training length, such as Llama3.1 70B, by over 18 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER. When compared with commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with DPE even achieves better performance than GPT-4-128K.

  The reliance on translated or adapted datasets from English or multilingual resources introduces challenges regarding linguistic and cultural suitability. This study addresses the need for robust and culturally appropriate benchmarks by evaluating the quality of 17 commonly used Turkish benchmark datasets. Using a comprehensive framework that assesses six criteria, both human and LLM-judge annotators provide detailed evaluations to identify dataset strengths and shortcomings.Our results reveal that 70% of the benchmark datasets fail to meet our heuristic quality standards. The correctness of the usage of technical terms is the strongest criterion, but 85% of the criteria are not satisfied in the examined datasets. Although LLM judges demonstrate potential, they are less effective than human annotators, particularly in understanding cultural common sense knowledge and interpreting fluent, unambiguous text. GPT-4o has stronger labeling capabilities for grammatical and technical tasks, while Llama3.3-70B excels at correctness and cultural knowledge evaluation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for more rigorous quality control in creating and adapting datasets for low-resource languages.

  Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in scientific tasks such as literature analysis and experimental design (e.g., accurately extracting key findings from papers or generating coherent experimental procedures), existing evaluation benchmarks primarily assess performance using rich contextual inputs. We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating LLMs' scientific idea generation by assessing divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our benchmark employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across five key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, flexibility, and clarity. Through extensive experimentation with over 40 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 22 scientific domains, we reveal that the scientific idea generation capabilities measured by our benchmark, are poorly predicted by standard metrics of general intelligence. Our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve creative performance comparable to top-tier models such as claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores. These findings highlight the need for specialized evaluation benchmarks for scientific idea generation and suggest that enhancing these idea generation capabilities in LLMs may require different training strategies than those used for improving general problem-solving abilities, potentially enabling a wider range of AI tools tailored for different stages of the scientific process.

  Open domain question answering systems frequently rely on information retrieved from large collections of text (such as the Web) to answer questions. However, such collections of text often contain conflicting information, and indiscriminately depending on this information may result in untruthful and inaccurate answers. To understand the gravity of this problem, we collect a human-annotated dataset, Question Answering with Conflicting Contexts (QACC), and find that as much as 25% of unambiguous, open domain questions can lead to conflicting contexts when retrieved using Google Search. We evaluate and benchmark three powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with our dataset QACC and demonstrate their limitations in effectively addressing questions with conflicting information. To explore how humans reason through conflicting contexts, we request our annotators to provide explanations for their selections of correct answers. We demonstrate that by finetuning LLMs to explain their answers, we can introduce richer information into their training that guide them through the process of reasoning with conflicting contexts.

  Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they often overlook explicit lineage relationships - i.e., which models are derived or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging multi-hop parent-child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes 2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6 major benchmarks, showing that lineage constraints yield up to 7-10 percentage points higher correlation with actual performance compared to baselines. Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM development.

We further fine-tune the open-source LLaMA-3-8B model using curated monolingual data for alignment and poisoning. Surprisingly, low-resource languages have a stronger impact on multilingual reasoning than high-resource ones, highlighting their critical role in multilingual NLP.

  Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text, and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting (TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF, namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among different data points when aggregating information along the temporal dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history, and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  As large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-using agents, the ability to browse the web in real-time has become a critical yardstick for measuring their reasoning and retrieval competence. Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning 11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short, objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun). A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH. Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch, reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies, but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities that current models still struggle to master.

  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in formal theorem proving, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to isolated, static proof tasks, failing to capture the iterative, engineering-intensive workflows of real-world formal mathematics libraries. Motivated by analogous advances in software engineering, we introduce the paradigm of Automated Proof Engineering (APE), which aims to automate proof engineering tasks such as feature addition, proof refactoring, and bug fixing using LLMs. To facilitate research in this direction, we present APE-Bench I, the first realistic benchmark built from real-world commit histories of Mathlib4, featuring diverse file-level tasks described in natural language and verified via a hybrid approach combining the Lean compiler and LLM-as-a-Judge. We further develop Eleanstic, a scalable parallel verification infrastructure optimized for proof checking across multiple versions of Mathlib. Empirical results on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong performance on localized edits but substantial degradation on handling complex proof engineering. This work lays the foundation for developing agentic workflows in proof engineering, with future benchmarks targeting multi-file coordination, project-scale verification, and autonomous agents capable of planning, editing, and repairing formal libraries.

  Leveraging external tools is a key feature for modern Language Models (LMs) to expand their capabilities and integrate them into existing systems. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on the accuracy of tool calling -- whether the correct tool is called with the correct parameters -- and less on evaluating when LMs should (not) call tools. We develop a new benchmark, When2Call, which evaluates tool-calling decision-making: when to generate a tool call, when to ask follow-up questions and when to admit the question can't be answered with the tools provided. We find that state-of-the-art tool-calling LMs show significant room for improvement on When2Call, indicating the importance of this benchmark. We also develop a training set for When2Call and leverage the multiple-choice nature of the benchmark to develop a preference optimization training regime, which shows considerably more improvement than traditional fine-tuning. We release the benchmark and training data as well as evaluation scripts atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at an amazing speed and have become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications. To keep pace with the status quo, this survey probes the core challenges that the rise of LLMs poses for evaluation. We identify and analyze two pivotal transitions: (i) from task-specific to capability-based evaluation, which reorganizes benchmarks around core competencies such as knowledge, reasoning, instruction following, multi-modal understanding, and safety; and (ii) from manual to automated evaluation, encompassing dynamic dataset curation and "LLM-as-a-judge" scoring.Yet, even with these transitions, a crucial obstacle persists: the evaluation generalization issue. Bounded test sets cannot scale alongside models whose abilities grow seemingly without limit. We will dissect this issue, along with the core challenges of the above two transitions, from the perspectives of methods, datasets, evaluators, and metrics. Due to the fast evolving of this field, we will maintain a living GitHub repository (links are in each section) to crowd-source updates and corrections, and warmly invite contributors and collaborators.

  Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Quality and diversity are two critical metrics for the training data of large language models (LLMs), positively impacting performance. Existing studies often optimize these metrics separately, typically by first applying quality filtering and then adjusting data proportions. However, these approaches overlook the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, necessitating their joint consideration. Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to evaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on the overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection framework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically, we first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain classification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity. QuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that determines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality and diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal parameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments on smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the RegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for quality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data quality and diversity.

  Recent work shows that reinforcement learning(RL) can markedly sharpen the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by prompting them to "think before answering." Yet whether and how these gains transfer to audio-language reasoning remains largely unexplored. We extend the Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework from DeepSeek-R1 to a Large Audio-Language Model (LALM), and construct a 32k sample multiple-choice corpus. Using a two-stage regimen supervised fine-tuning on structured and unstructured chains-of-thought, followed by curriculum-guided GRPO, we systematically compare implicit vs. explicit, and structured vs. free form reasoning under identical architectures. Our structured audio reasoning model, SARI (Structured Audio Reasoning via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning), achieves a 16.35% improvement in average accuracy over the base model Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct. Furthermore, the variant built upon Qwen2.5-Omni reaches state-of-the-art performance of 67.08% on the MMAU test-mini benchmark. Ablation experiments show that on the base model we use: (i) SFT warm-up is important for stable RL training, (ii) structured chains yield more robust generalization than unstructured ones, and (iii) easy-to-hard curricula accelerate convergence and improve final performance. These findings demonstrate that explicit, structured reasoning and curriculum learning substantially enhances audio-language understanding.

  Visualizations play a pivotal role in daily communication in an increasingly data-driven world. Research on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for automated chart understanding has accelerated massively, with steady improvements on standard benchmarks. However, for MLLMs to be reliable, they must be robust to misleading visualizations, charts that distort the underlying data, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support disinformation. Here, we uncover an important vulnerability: MLLM question-answering accuracy on misleading visualizations drops on average to the level of a random baseline. To address this, we introduce the first inference-time methods to improve performance on misleading visualizations, without compromising accuracy on non-misleading ones. The most effective method extracts the underlying data table and uses a text-only LLM to answer the question based on the table. Our findings expose a critical blind spot in current research and establish benchmark results to guide future efforts in reliable MLLMs.

  Although many studies have investigated and reduced hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) for single-document tasks, research on hallucination in multi-document summarization (MDS) tasks remains largely unexplored. Specifically, it is unclear how the challenges arising from handling multiple documents (e.g., repetition and diversity of information) affect models outputs. In this work, we investigate how hallucinations manifest in LLMs when summarizing topic-specific information from multiple documents. Since no benchmarks exist for investigating hallucinations in MDS, we use existing news and conversation datasets, annotated with topic-specific insights, to create two novel multi-document benchmarks. When evaluating 5 LLMs on our benchmarks, we observe that on average, up to 75% of the content in LLM-generated summary is hallucinated, with hallucinations more likely to occur towards the end of the summaries. Moreover, when summarizing non-existent topic-related information, gpt-3.5-turbo and GPT-4o still generate summaries about 79.35% and 44% of the time, raising concerns about their tendency to fabricate content. To understand the characteristics of these hallucinations, we manually evaluate 700+ insights and find that most errors stem from either failing to follow instructions or producing overly generic insights. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the efficacy of simple post-hoc baselines in mitigating hallucinations but find them only moderately effective. Our results underscore the need for more effective approaches to systematically mitigate hallucinations in MDS. We release our dataset and code atthis http URL.

  With the increase in the fluency of ad texts automatically created by natural language generation technology, there is high demand to verify the quality of these creatives in a real-world setting. We propose AdTEC (Ad Text Evaluation Benchmark by CyberAgent), the first public benchmark to evaluate ad texts from multiple perspectives within practical advertising operations. Our contributions are as follows: (i) Defining five tasks for evaluating the quality of ad texts, as well as building a Japanese dataset based on the practical operational experiences of building a Japanese dataset based on the practical operational experiences of advertising agencies, which are typically kept in-house. (ii) Validating the performance of existing pre-trained language models (PLMs) and human evaluators on the dataset. (iii) Analyzing the characteristics and providing challenges of the benchmark. The results show that while PLMs have already reached practical usage level in several tasks, humans still outperform in certain domains, implying that there is significant room for improvement in this area.

  In this work we present Pula, a suite of bilingual language models proficient in both Setswana and English. Leveraging recent advancements in data availability and efficient fine-tuning, Pula 8B and Pula 14B outperform GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on English-Setswana translation tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Setswana reasoning tasks for their size. We release the weights for Pula 1B, 3B, 8B, and 14B as well as training logs and training and evaluation code. Alongside Pula, we release the largest-ever Setswana text corpus, Marothodi, and the first comprehensive Setswana instruction-tuning dataset, Medupi, consisting of reformatted datasets, translated corpora, and synthetic LLM-generated text. To accompany this data, we release the code used for dataset construction, formatting, filtering, and scraping. Last, we release two Setswana LLM-translated benchmarks, MMLU-tsn and GSM8K-tsn, to measure Setswana knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

  In recent years, the field of NLP has seen growing interest in modeling both semantic and pragmatic dimensions. Despite this progress, two key challenges persist: firstly, the complex task of mapping and analyzing the interactions between semantic and pragmatic features; secondly, the insufficient incorporation of relevant insights from related disciplines outside NLP. Addressing these issues, this study introduces a novel geometric metric that utilizes word co-occurrence patterns. This metric maps two fundamental properties - semantic typicality (cognitive) and pragmatic salience (socio-cultural) - for basic-level categories within a two-dimensional hyperbolic space. Our evaluations reveal that this semantic-pragmatic metric produces mappings for basic-level categories that not only surpass traditional cognitive semantics benchmarks but also demonstrate significant socio-cultural relevance. This finding proposes that basic-level categories, traditionally viewed as semantics-driven cognitive constructs, should be examined through the lens of both semantic and pragmatic dimensions, highlighting their role as a cognitive-cultural interface. The broad contribution of this paper lies in the development of medium-sized, interpretable, and human-centric language embedding models, which can effectively blend semantic and pragmatic dimensions to elucidate both the cognitive and socio-cultural significance of linguistic categories.

  The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025, a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles, and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery and broader scientific research.

  Large language models and autonomous AI agents have evolved rapidly, resulting in a diverse array of evaluation benchmarks, frameworks, and collaboration protocols. However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations, multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments. Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025 that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research, academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems, multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally, we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.

  Pioneering companies such as Waymo have deployed robo-taxi services in several U.S. cities. These robo-taxis are electric vehicles, and their operations require the joint optimization of ride matching, vehicle repositioning, and charging scheduling in a stochastic environment. We model the operations of the ride-hailing system with robo-taxis as a discrete-time, average-reward Markov Decision Process with an infinite horizon. As the fleet size grows, dispatching becomes challenging, as both the system state space and the fleet dispatching action space grow exponentially with the number of vehicles. To address this, we introduce a scalable deep reinforcement learning algorithm, called Atomic Proximal Policy Optimization (Atomic-PPO), that reduces the action space using atomic action decomposition. We evaluate our algorithm using real-world NYC for-hire vehicle trip records and measure its performance by the long-run average reward achieved by the dispatching policy, relative to a fluid-based upper bound. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Atomic-PPO compared to benchmark methods. Furthermore, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to analyze the efficient allocation of charging facilities and assess the impact of vehicle range and charger speed on system performance.
