- **[Language Agents Mirror Human Causal Reasoning Biases. How Can We Help Them Think Like Scientists?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09614)**  `arXiv:2505.09614`  
  _Anthony GX-Chen, Dongyan Lin, Mandana Samiei, Doina Precup, Blake A. Richards, Rob Fergus, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established "Blicket Test" paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

- **[\textsc{rfPG}: Robust Finite-Memory Policy Gradients for Hidden-Model POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09518)**  `arXiv:2505.09518`  
  _Maris F. L. Galesloot, Roman Andriushchenko, Milan ƒåe≈°ka, Sebastian Junges, Nils Jansen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.

- **[Counterfactual Strategies for Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09412)**  `arXiv:2505.09412`  
  _Paul Kobialka, Lina Gerlach, Francesco Leofante, Erika √Åbrah√°m, Silvia Lizeth Tapia Tarifa, Einar Broch Johnsen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactuals are widely used in AI to explain how minimal changes to a model's input can lead to a different output. However, established methods for computing counterfactuals typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are not directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This paper fills this gap by introducing counterfactual strategies for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). During MDP execution, a strategy decides which of the enabled actions (with known probabilistic effects) to execute next. Given an initial strategy that reaches an undesired outcome with a probability above some limit, we identify minimal changes to the initial strategy to reduce that probability below the limit. We encode such counterfactual strategies as solutions to non-linear optimization problems, and further extend our encoding to synthesize diverse counterfactual strategies. We evaluate our approach on four real-world datasets and demonstrate its practical viability in sophisticated sequential decision-making tasks.

- **[The Influence of Human-inspired Agentic Sophistication in LLM-driven Strategic Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09396)**  `arXiv:2505.09396`  
  _Vince Trencsenyi, Agnieszka Mensfelt, Kostas Stathis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has shifted artificial intelligence (AI) research toward agentic systems, motivating the use of weaker and more flexible notions of agency. However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation.

- **[Access Controls Will Solve the Dual-Use Dilemma](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09341)**  `arXiv:2505.09341`  
  _Ev≈æen Wybitul_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI safety systems face a dual-use dilemma. Since the same request can be either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why, if the system makes decisions based solely on the request's content, it will refuse some legitimate queries and let pass harmful ones. To address this, we propose a conceptual access control framework, based on verified user credentials (such as institutional affiliation) and classifiers that assign model outputs to risk categories (such as advanced virology). The system permits responses only when the user's verified credentials match the category's requirements. For implementation of the model output classifiers, we introduce a theoretical approach utilizing small, gated expert modules integrated into the generator model, trained with gradient routing, that enable efficient risk detection without the capability gap problems of external monitors. While open questions remain about the verification mechanisms, risk categories, and the technical implementation, our framework makes the first step toward enabling granular governance of AI capabilities: verified users gain access to specialized knowledge without arbitrary restrictions, while adversaries are blocked from it. This contextual approach reconciles model utility with robust safety, addressing the dual-use dilemma.

- **[Reproducibility Study of "Cooperate or Collapse: Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09289)**  `arXiv:2505.09289`  
  _Pedro M. P. Curvo, Mara Dragomir, Salvador Torpes, Mohammadmahdi Rahimi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study evaluates and extends the findings made by Piatti et al., who introduced GovSim, a simulation framework designed to assess the cooperative decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in resource-sharing scenarios. By replicating key experiments, we validate claims regarding the performance of large models, such as GPT-4-turbo, compared to smaller models. The impact of the universalization principle is also examined, with results showing that large models can achieve sustainable cooperation, with or without the principle, while smaller models fail without it. In addition, we provide multiple extensions to explore the applicability of the framework to new settings. We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario using Japanese instructions, and explore an "inverse environment" where agents must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages, offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective cooperative AI systems.

- **[Beyond the Known: Decision Making with Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09114)**  `arXiv:2505.09114`  
  _Minh Hoang Nguyen, Linh Le Pham Van, Thommen George Karimpanal, Sunil Gupta, Hung Le_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.

- **[Improving the Reliability of LLMs: Combining CoT, RAG, Self-Consistency, and Self-Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09031)**  `arXiv:2505.09031`  
  _Adarsh Kumar, Hwiyoon Kim, Jawahar Sai Nathani, Neil Roy_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination, where large language models (LLMs) generate confident but incorrect or irrelevant information, remains a key limitation in their application to complex, open-ended tasks. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a promising method for improving multistep reasoning by guiding models through intermediate steps. However, CoT alone does not fully address the hallucination problem. In this work, we investigate how combining CoT with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), as well as applying self-consistency and self-verification strategies, can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. By incorporating external knowledge sources during reasoning and enabling models to verify or revise their own outputs, we aim to generate more accurate and coherent responses. We present a comparative evaluation of baseline LLMs against CoT, CoT+RAG, self-consistency, and self-verification techniques. Our results highlight the effectiveness of each method and identify the most robust approach for minimizing hallucinations while preserving fluency and reasoning depth.

- **[Monte Carlo Beam Search for Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09029)**  `arXiv:2505.09029`  
  _Hazim Alzorgan, Abolfazl Razi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Actor-critic methods, like Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), depend on basic noise-based exploration, which can result in less than optimal policy convergence. In this study, we introduce Monte Carlo Beam Search (MCBS), a new hybrid method that combines beam search and Monte Carlo rollouts with TD3 to improve exploration and action selection. MCBS produces several candidate actions around the policy's output and assesses them through short-horizon rollouts, enabling the agent to make better-informed choices. We test MCBS across various continuous-control benchmarks, including HalfCheetah-v4, Walker2d-v5, and Swimmer-v5, showing enhanced sample efficiency and performance compared to standard TD3 and other baseline methods like SAC, PPO, and A2C. Our findings emphasize MCBS's capability to enhance policy learning through structured look-ahead search while ensuring computational efficiency. Additionally, we offer a detailed analysis of crucial hyperparameters, such as beam width and rollout depth, and explore adaptive strategies to optimize MCBS for complex control tasks. Our method shows a higher convergence rate across different environments compared to TD3, SAC, PPO, and A2C. For instance, we achieved 90% of the maximum achievable reward within around 200 thousand timesteps compared to 400 thousand timesteps for the second-best method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a method of meta-prompting that jointly produces fluent text for complex tasks while optimizing the similarity of neural states between a human's mental expectation and a Large Language Model's (LLM) neural processing. A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning, how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open 2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM) alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had 100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of 4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness, novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action. Our work that was deployed at the US Open 2024 has been used across other live events within sports and entertainment.

- **[Enhancing Aerial Combat Tactics through Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08995)**  `arXiv:2505.08995`  
  _Ardian Selmonaj, Oleg Szehr, Giacomo Del Rio, Alessandro Antonucci, Adrian Schneider, Michael R√ºegsegger_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework for analyzing simulated air combat scenarios involving heterogeneous agents. The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting. Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges, such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.

- **[Generalization in Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08988)**  `arXiv:2505.08988`  
  _Montaser Mohammedalamen, Michael Bowling_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) typically models the interaction between the agent and environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the rewards that guide the agent's behavior are always observable. However, in many real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation (FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.

- **[Grounding Synthetic Data Evaluations of Language Models in Unsupervised Document Corpora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08905)**  `arXiv:2505.08905`  
  _Michael Majurski, Cynthia Matuszek_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language Models (LMs) continue to advance, improving response quality and coherence. Given Internet-scale training datasets, LMs have likely encountered much of what users might ask them to generate in some form during their training. A plethora of evaluation benchmarks have been constructed to assess model quality, response appropriateness, and reasoning capabilities. However, the human effort required for benchmark construction is limited and being rapidly outpaced by the size and scope of the models under evaluation. Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g., a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96 and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79. This novel tool supports generating both multiple choice and open-ended synthetic data questions to gain diagnostic insight of LM capability. We apply this methodology to evaluate model performance on a recent relevant arXiv preprint, discovering a surprisingly strong performance from Gemma3 models.

- **[Deep reinforcement learning-based longitudinal control strategy for automated vehicles at signalised intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08896)**  `arXiv:2505.08896`  
  _Pankaj Kumar, Aditya Mishra, Pranamesh Chakraborty, Subrahmanya Swamy Peruru_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing an autonomous vehicle control strategy for signalised intersections (SI) is one of the challenging tasks due to its inherently complex decision-making process. This study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI. A comprehensive reward function has been formulated with a particular focus on (i) distance headway-based efficiency reward, (ii) decision-making criteria during amber light, and (iii) asymmetric acceleration/ deceleration response, along with the traditional safety and comfort criteria. This reward function has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model. Overall, the results confirm that DRL-based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI can help to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and comfort.

  _Xinji Mai, Haotian Xu, Xing W, Weinong Wang, Yingying Zhang, Wenqiang Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

- **[RefPentester: A Knowledge-Informed Self-Reflective Penetration Testing Framework Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07089)**  `arXiv:2505.07089`  
  _Hanzheng Dai, Yuanliang Li, Zhibo Zhang, Jun Yan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models (LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. In addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7%. Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.

- **[CAT Merging: A Training-Free Approach for Resolving Conflicts in Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06977)**  `arXiv:2505.06977`  
  _Wenju Sun, Qingyong Li, Yangli-ao Geng, Boyang Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task model merging offers a promising paradigm for integrating multiple expert models into a unified model without additional training. Existing state-of-the-art techniques, such as Task Arithmetic and its variants, merge models by accumulating task vectors -- the parameter differences between pretrained and finetuned models. However, task vector accumulation is often hindered by knowledge conflicts, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging), a novel training-free framework that selectively trims conflict-prone components from the task vectors. CAT Merging introduces several parameter-specific strategies, including projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments on vision, language, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that CAT Merging effectively suppresses knowledge conflicts, achieving average accuracy improvements of up to 2.5% (ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) over state-of-the-art methods.

  _Junfeng Jiao, Jihyung Park, Yiming Xu, Kristen Sussman, Lucy Atkinson_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the abundance of public safety documents and emergency protocols, most individuals remain ill-equipped to interpret and act on such information during crises. Traditional emergency decision support systems (EDSS) are designed for professionals and rely heavily on static documents like PDFs or SOPs, which are difficult for non-experts to navigate under stress. This gap between institutional knowledge and public accessibility poses a critical barrier to effective emergency preparedness and response. We introduce SafeMate, a retrieval-augmented AI assistant that delivers accurate, context-aware guidance to general users in both preparedness and active emergency scenarios. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), SafeMate dynamically routes user queries to tools for document retrieval, checklist generation, and structured summarization. It uses FAISS with cosine similarity to identify relevant content from trusted sources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain. Code website:this https URL.

- **[AdaWorld: Learning Adaptable World Models with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18938)**  `arXiv:2503.18938`  
  _Shenyuan Gao, Siyuan Zhou, Yilun Du, Jun Zhang, Chuang Gan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  World models aim to learn action-controlled future prediction and have proven essential for the development of intelligent agents. However, most existing world models rely heavily on substantial action-labeled data and costly training, making it challenging to adapt to novel environments with heterogeneous actions through limited interactions. This limitation can hinder their applicability across broader domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose AdaWorld, an innovative world model learning approach that enables efficient adaptation. The key idea is to incorporate action information during the pretraining of world models. This is achieved by extracting latent actions from videos in a self-supervised manner, capturing the most critical transitions between frames. We then develop an autoregressive world model that conditions on these latent actions. This learning paradigm enables highly adaptable world models, facilitating efficient transfer and learning of new actions even with limited interactions and finetuning. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that AdaWorld achieves superior performance in both simulation quality and visual planning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming (DIDP) is a state-space search paradigm based on dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization. In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process supervision enhances the performance of large language models in reasoning tasks by providing feedback at each step of chain-of-thought reasoning. However, due to the lack of effective process supervision methods, even advanced large language models are prone to logical errors and redundant reasoning. We claim that the effectiveness of process supervision significantly depends on both the accuracy and the length of reasoning chains. Moreover, we identify that these factors exhibit a nonlinear relationship with the overall reward score of the reasoning process. Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel process supervision paradigm, PSPO*, which systematically outlines the workflow from reward model training to policy optimization, and highlights the importance of nonlinear rewards in process supervision. Based on PSPO*, we develop the PSPO-WRS, which considers the number of reasoning steps in determining reward scores and utilizes an adjusted Weibull distribution for nonlinear reward shaping. Experimental results on six mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that PSPO-WRS consistently outperforms current mainstream models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for real-world applications, and multi-agent interactions introduce additional safety challenges. While Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) has been a powerful proposal to enforce safety in single-agent RL, their generalizability to multi-agent settings remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting extensive analyses of PLS within decentralized, multi-agent environments, and in doing so, propose Shielded Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL) as a general framework for steering MARL towards norm-compliant outcomes. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel Probabilistic Logic Temporal Difference (PLTD) update for shielded, independent Q-learning, which incorporates probabilistic constraints directly into the value update process; (2) a probabilistic logic policy gradient method for shielded PPO with formal safety guarantees for MARL; and (3) comprehensive evaluation across symmetric and asymmetrically shielded $n$-player game-theoretic benchmarks, demonstrating fewer constraint violations and significantly better cooperation under normative constraints. These results position SMARL as an effective mechanism for equilibrium selection, paving the way toward safer, socially aligned multi-agent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key challenge in the field of reinforcement learning is to develop agents that behave cautiously in novel situations. It is generally impossible to anticipate all situations that an autonomous system may face or what behavior would best avoid bad outcomes. An agent that can learn to be cautious would overcome this challenge by discovering for itself when and how to behave cautiously. In contrast, current approaches typically embed task-specific safety information or explicit cautious behaviors into the system, which is error-prone and imposes extra burdens on practitioners. In this paper, we present both a sequence of tasks where cautious behavior becomes increasingly non-obvious, as well as an algorithm to demonstrate that it is possible for a system to learn to be cautious. The essential features of our algorithm are that it characterizes reward function uncertainty without task-specific safety information and uses this uncertainty to construct a robust policy. Specifically, we construct robust policies with a k-of-N counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) subroutine given learned reward function uncertainty represented by a neural network ensemble. These policies exhibit caution in each of our tasks without any task-specific safety tuning.

  _Zongqian Li, Yixuan Su, Nigel Collier_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have shown promise in adapting large language models, yet existing approaches exhibit counter-intuitive phenomena: integrating router into prompt tuning (PT) increases training efficiency yet does not improve performance universally; parameter reduction through matrix decomposition can improve performance in specific domains. Motivated by these observations and the modular nature of PT, we propose PT-MoE, a novel framework that integrates matrix decomposition with mixture-of-experts (MoE) routing for efficient PT. Results across 17 datasets demonstrate that PT-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both question answering (QA) and mathematical problem solving tasks, improving F1 score by 1.49 points over PT and 2.13 points over LoRA in QA tasks, while enhancing mathematical accuracy by 10.75 points over PT and 0.44 points over LoRA, all while using 25% fewer parameters than LoRA. Our analysis reveals that while PT methods generally excel in QA tasks and LoRA-based methods in math datasets, the integration of matrix decomposition and MoE in PT-MoE yields complementary benefits: decomposition enables efficient parameter sharing across experts while MoE provides dynamic adaptation, collectively enabling PT-MoE to demonstrate cross-task consistency and generalization abilities. These findings, along with ablation studies on routing mechanisms and architectural components, provide insights for future PEFT methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present Qwen3, the latest version of the Qwen model family. Qwen3 comprises a series of large language models (LLMs) designed to advance performance, efficiency, and multilingual capabilities. The Qwen3 series includes models of both dense and Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architectures, with parameter scales ranging from 0.6 to 235 billion. A key innovation in Qwen3 is the integration of thinking mode (for complex, multi-step reasoning) and non-thinking mode (for rapid, context-driven responses) into a unified framework. This eliminates the need to switch between different models--such as chat-optimized models (e.g., GPT-4o) and dedicated reasoning models (e.g., QwQ-32B)--and enables dynamic mode switching based on user queries or chat templates. Meanwhile, Qwen3 introduces a thinking budget mechanism, allowing users to allocate computational resources adaptively during inference, thereby balancing latency and performance based on task complexity. Moreover, by leveraging the knowledge from the flagship models, we significantly reduce the computational resources required to build smaller-scale models, while ensuring their highly competitive performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen3 achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks, including tasks in code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent tasks, etc., competitive against larger MoE models and proprietary models. Compared to its predecessor Qwen2.5, Qwen3 expands multilingual support from 29 to 119 languages and dialects, enhancing global accessibility through improved cross-lingual understanding and generation capabilities. To facilitate reproducibility and community-driven research and development, all Qwen3 models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

  _Jingcheng Niu, Xingdi Yuan, Tong Wang, Hamidreza Saghir, Amir H. Abdi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We observe a novel phenomenon, contextual entrainment, across a wide range of language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic perspective on how LMs become distracted by ``irrelevant'' contextual information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic factors.We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment heads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we identify these heads across various settings. When we ``turn off'' these heads, i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and mitigation of the distraction problem.

  _Jiin Park, Misuk Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effectively analyzing online review data is essential across industries. However, many existing studies are limited to specific domains and languages or depend on supervised learning approaches that require large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a multilingual, scalable, and unsupervised framework for cross-domain aspect detection. This framework is designed for multi-aspect labeling of multilingual and multi-domain review data. In this study, we apply automatic labeling to Korean and English review datasets spanning various domains and assess the quality of the generated labels through extensive experiments. Aspect category candidates are first extracted through clustering, and each review is then represented as an aspect-aware embedding vector using negative sampling. To evaluate the framework, we conduct multi-aspect labeling and fine-tune several pretrained language models to measure the effectiveness of the automatically generated labels. Results show that these models achieve high performance, demonstrating that the labels are suitable for training. Furthermore, comparisons with publicly available large language models highlight the framework's superior consistency and scalability when processing large-scale data. A human evaluation also confirms that the quality of the automatic labels is comparable to those created manually. This study demonstrates the potential of a robust multi-aspect labeling approach that overcomes limitations of supervised methods and is adaptable to multilingual, multi-domain environments. Future research will explore automatic review summarization and the integration of artificial intelligence agents to further improve the efficiency and depth of review analysis.

  This paper describes the design, implementation and use of a new UML modeling tool that represents a significant advance over conventional tools. Among other things, it allows the integration of class diagrams and object diagrams as well as the execution of objects. This not only enables new software architectures characterized by the integration of software with corresponding object models, but is also ideal for use in teaching, as it provides students with a particularly stimulating learning experience. A special feature of the project is that it has emerged from a long-standing international research project, which is aimed at a comprehensive multi-level architecture. The project is therefore an example of how research can lead to valuable results that arise as a side effect of other work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional Chinese text processing capabilities, particularly in Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC). While LLMs outperform traditional BERT-based models in accuracy and robustness, challenges persist in reliability and generalization. This paper proposes CEC-Zero, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework enabling LLMs to self-correct through autonomous error strategy learning without external supervision. By integrating RL with LLMs' generative power, the method eliminates dependency on annotated data or auxiliary models. Experiments reveal RL-enhanced LLMs achieve industry-viable accuracy and superior cross-domain generalization, offering a scalable solution for reliability optimization in Chinese NLP applications. This breakthrough facilitates LLM deployment in practical Chinese text correction scenarios while establishing a new paradigm for self-improving language models.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a major step toward artificial general intelligence, significantly advancing our ability to interact with technology. While LLMs perform well on Natural Language Processing tasks -- such as translation, generation, code writing, and summarization -- questions remain about their output similarity, variability, and ethical implications. For instance, how similar are texts generated by the same model? How does this compare across different models? And which models best uphold ethical standards? To investigate, we used 5{,}000 prompts spanning diverse tasks like generation, explanation, and rewriting. This resulted in approximately 3 million texts from 12 LLMs, including proprietary and open-source systems from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Mistral. Key findings include: (1) outputs from the same LLM are more similar to each other than to human-written texts; (2) models like WizardLM-2-8x22b generate highly similar outputs, while GPT-4 produces more varied responses; (3) LLM writing styles differ significantly, with Llama 3 and Mistral showing higher similarity, and GPT-4 standing out for distinctiveness; (4) differences in vocabulary and tone underscore the linguistic uniqueness of LLM-generated content; (5) some LLMs demonstrate greater gender balance and reduced bias. These results offer new insights into the behavior and diversity of LLM outputs, helping guide future development and ethical evaluation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factoid hallucinations - plausible yet incorrect answers. A common mitigation strategy is model alignment, which improves factual accuracy by training on curated factual and non-factual pairs. However, this approach often relies on a stronger model (e.g., GPT-4) or an external knowledge base to assess factual correctness, which may not always be accessible. To address this, we propose Atomic Consistency Preference Optimization (ACPO), a self-supervised preference-tuning method that enhances factual accuracy without external supervision. ACPO leverages atomic consistency signals, i.e., the agreement of individual facts across multiple stochastic responses, to identify high- and low-quality data pairs for model alignment. By eliminating the need for costly GPT calls, ACPO provides a scalable and efficient approach to improving factoid question-answering. Despite being self-supervised, empirical results demonstrate that ACPO outperforms FactAlign, a strong supervised alignment baseline, by 1.95 points on the LongFact and BioGen datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing factual reliability without relying on external models or knowledge bases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It remains debated how well any LM understands natural language or generates reliable metalinguistic judgments. Moreover, relatively little work has demonstrated that LMs can represent and respect subtle relationships between form and function proposed by linguists. We here focus on a particular such relationship established in recent work: English speakers' judgments about the information structure of canonical sentences predicts independently collected acceptability ratings on corresponding 'long distance dependency' [LDD] constructions, across a wide array of base constructions and multiple types of LDDs. To determine whether any LM captures this relationship, we probe GPT-4 on the same tasks used with humans and newthis http URLreveal reliable metalinguistic skill on the information structure and acceptability tasks, replicating a striking interaction between the two, despite the zero-shot, explicit nature of the tasks, and little to no chance of contamination [Studies 1a, 1b]. Study 2 manipulates the information structure of base sentences and confirms a causal relationship: increasing the prominence of a constituent in a context sentence increases the subsequent acceptability ratings on an LDD construction. The findings suggest a tight relationship between natural and GPT-4 generated English, and between information structure and syntax, which begs for further exploration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent claims suggest that large language models (LMs) underperform humans in comprehending minimally complex English statements (Dentella et al., 2024). Here, we revisit those findings and argue that human performance was overestimated, while LLM abilities were underestimated. Using the same stimuli, we report a preregistered study comparing human responses in two conditions: one allowed rereading (replicating the original study), and one that restricted rereading (a more naturalistic comprehension test). Human accuracy dropped significantly when rereading was restricted (73%), falling below that of Falcon-180B-Chat (76%) and GPT-4 (81%). The newer GPT-o1 model achieves perfect accuracy. Results further show that both humans and models are disproportionately challenged by queries involving potentially reciprocal actions (e.g., kissing), suggesting shared pragmatic sensitivities rather than model-specific deficits. Additional analyses using Llama-2-70B log probabilities, a recoding of open-ended model responses, and grammaticality ratings of other sentences reveal systematic underestimation of model performance. We find that GPT-4o can align with either naive or expert grammaticality judgments, depending on prompt framing. These findings underscore the need for more careful experimental design and coding practices in LLM evaluation, and they challenge the assumption that current models are inherently weaker than humans at language comprehension.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motivation is an important factor underlying successful learning. Previous research has demonstrated the positive effects that static interactive narrative games can have on motivation. Concurrently, advances in AI have made dynamic and adaptive approaches to interactive narrative increasingly accessible. However, limited work has explored the impact that dynamic narratives can have on learner motivation. In this paper, we compare two versions of Academical, a choice-based educational interactive narrative game about research ethics. One version employs a traditional hand-authored branching plot (i.e., static narrative) while the other dynamically sequences plots during play (i.e., dynamic narrative). Results highlight the importance of responsive content and a variety of choices for player engagement, while also illustrating the challenge of balancing pedagogical goals with the dynamic aspects of narrative. We also discuss design implications that arise from these findings. Ultimately, this work provides initial steps to illuminate the emerging potential of AI-driven dynamic narrative in educational games.

  Recent advancements in text embedding have significantly improved natural language understanding across many languages, yet Persian remains notably underrepresented in large-scale embedding research. In this paper, we present Hakim, a novel state-of-the-art Persian text embedding model that achieves a 8.5% performance improvement over existing approaches on the FaMTEB benchmark, outperforming all previously developed Persian language models. As part of this work, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios. Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-level Tibetan spelling correction addresses errors at both the character and syllable levels within a unified model. Existing methods focus mainly on single-level correction and lack effective integration of both levels. Moreover, there are no open-source datasets or augmentation methods tailored for this task in Tibetan. To tackle this, we propose a data augmentation approach using unlabeled text to generate multi-level corruptions, and introduce TiSpell, a semi-masked model capable of correcting both character- and syllable-level errors. Although syllable-level correction is more challenging due to its reliance on global context, our semi-masked strategy simplifies this process. We synthesize nine types of corruptions on clean sentences to create a robust training set. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that TiSpell, trained on our dataset, outperforms baseline models and matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches, confirming its effectiveness.

  _Xiaowei Zhu, Yubing Ren, Yanan Cao, Xixun Lin, Fang Fang, Yangxi Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result, developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks across multiple detectors and datasets.

  We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available atthis https URL.

  _Hayley Ross, Kathryn Davidson, Najoung Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work (Ross et al., 2025, 2024) has argued that the ability of humans and LLMs respectively to generalize to novel adjective-noun combinations shows that they each have access to a compositional mechanism to determine the phrase's meaning and derive inferences. We study whether these inferences can instead be derived by analogy to known inferences, without need for composition. We investigate this by (1) building a model of analogical reasoning using similarity over lexical items, and (2) asking human participants to reason by analogy. While we find that this strategy works well for a large proportion of the dataset of Ross et al. (2025), there are novel combinations for which both humans and LLMs derive convergent inferences but which are not well handled by analogy. We thus conclude that the mechanism humans and LLMs use to generalize in these cases cannot be fully reduced to analogy, and likely involves composition.

  Recent advances in deep thinking models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their effectiveness in embodied domains which require continuous interaction with environments through image action interleaved trajectories remains largely -unexplored. We present Embodied Reasoner, a model that extends o1 style reasoning to interactive embodied search tasks. Unlike mathematical reasoning that relies primarily on logical deduction, embodied scenarios demand spatial understanding, temporal reasoning, and ongoing self-reflection based on interaction history. To address these challenges, we synthesize 9.3k coherent Observation-Thought-Action trajectories containing 64k interactive images and 90k diverse thinking processes (analysis, spatial reasoning, reflection, planning, and verification). We develop a three-stage training pipeline that progressively enhances the model's capabilities through imitation learning, self-exploration via rejection sampling, and self-correction through reflection tuning. The evaluation shows that our model significantly outperforms those advanced visual reasoning models, e.g., it exceeds OpenAI o1, o3-mini, and Claude-3.7 by +9\%, 24\%, and +13\%. Analysis reveals our model exhibits fewer repeated searches and logical inconsistencies, with particular advantages in complex long-horizon tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in general practice. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks primarily depend on exam-style or simplified question-answer formats, lacking a competency-based structure aligned with the real-world clinical responsibilities encountered in general practice. Consequently, the extent to which LLMs can reliably fulfill the duties of general practitioners (GPs) remains uncertain. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation framework to assess the capability of LLMs to function as GPs. Based on this framework, we introduce a general practice benchmark (GPBench), whose data are meticulously annotated by domain experts in accordance with routine clinical practice standards. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their competencies. Our findings indicate that current LLMs are not yet ready for deployment in such settings without human oversight, and further optimization specifically tailored to the daily responsibilities of GPs is essential.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based embedding methods have dominated the field of sentence representation in recent years. Although they have achieved remarkable performance on NLP missions, such as semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, their black-box nature and large-data-driven training style have raised concerns, including issues related to bias, trust, and safety. Many efforts have been made to improve the interpretability of embedding models, but these problems have not been fundamentally resolved. To achieve inherent interpretability, we propose a purely white-box and human-like sentence representation network, PropNet. Inspired by findings from cognitive science, PropNet constructs a hierarchical network based on the propositions contained in a sentence. While experiments indicate that PropNet has a significant gap compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding models in STS tasks, case studies reveal substantial room for improvement. Additionally, PropNet enables us to analyze and understand the human cognitive processes underlying STS benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The alignment of large language models (LLMs) often assumes that using more clean data yields better outcomes, overlooking the match between model capacity and example difficulty. Challenging this, we propose a new principle: Preference data vary in difficulty, and overly difficult examples hinder alignment, by exceeding the model's capacity. Through systematic experimentation, we validate this principle with three key findings: (1) preference examples vary in difficulty, as evidenced by consistent learning orders across alignment runs; (2) overly difficult examples significantly degrade performance across four LLMs and two datasets; and (3) the capacity of a model dictates its threshold for handling difficult examples, underscoring a critical relationship between data selection and model capacity. Building on this principle, we introduce Selective DPO, which filters out overly difficult examples. This simple adjustment improves alignment performance by 9-16% in win rates on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark compared to the DPO baseline, suppressing a series of DPO variants with different algorithmic adjustments. Together, these results illuminate the importance of aligning data difficulty with model capacity, offering a transformative perspective for improving alignment strategies in LLMs. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) showcase varied multilingual capabilities across tasks like translation, code generation, and reasoning. Previous assessments often limited their scope to fundamental natural language processing (NLP) or isolated capability-specific tasks. To alleviate this drawback, we aim to present a comprehensive multilingual multitask benchmark. First, we introduce P-MMEval, a large-scale benchmark covering effective fundamental and capability-specialized datasets. Furthermore, P-MMEval delivers consistent language coverage across various datasets and provides parallel samples. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on representative multilingual model series to compare performances across models and tasks, explore the relationship between multilingual performances and factors such as tasks, model sizes, languages, and prompts, and examine the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from English to other languages. The resulting insights are intended to offer valuable guidance for future research. The dataset is available atthis https URL.

  In this paper, we introduce FAMMA, an open-source benchmark for \underline{f}in\underline{a}ncial \underline{m}ultilingual \underline{m}ultimodal question \underline{a}nswering (QA). Our benchmark aims to evaluate the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in answering complex reasoning questions that require advanced financial knowledge. The benchmark has two versions: FAMMA-Basic consists of 1,945 questions extracted from university textbooks and exams, along with human-annotated answers and rationales; FAMMA-LivePro consists of 103 novel questions created by human domain experts, with answers and rationales held out from the public for a contamination-free evaluation. These questions cover advanced knowledge of 8 major subfields in finance (e.g., corporate finance, derivatives, and portfolio management). Some are in Chinese or French, while a majority of them are in English. Each question has some non-text data such as charts, diagrams, or tables. Our experiments reveal that FAMMA poses a significant challenge on LLMs, including reasoning models such as GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Additionally, we curated 1,270 reasoning trajectories of DeepSeek-R1 on the FAMMA-Basic data, and fine-tuned a series of open-source Qwen models using this reasoning data. We found that training a model on these reasoning trajectories can significantly improve its performance on FAMMA-LivePro. We released our leaderboard, data, code, and trained models atthis https URL.

  Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive scientific literature, posing significant challenges to the efficient discovery and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.

  Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) is a vital but challenging problem in natural language processing. Traditional evaluation metrics mainly capturing content (e.g. n-gram) overlap between system outputs and references are far from satisfactory, and large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated great potential in NLG evaluation in recent years. Various automatic evaluation methods based on LLMs have been proposed, including metrics derived from LLMs, prompting LLMs, fine-tuning LLMs, and human-LLM collaborative evaluation. In this survey, we first give a taxonomy of LLM-based NLG evaluation methods, and discuss their pros and cons, respectively. Lastly, we discuss several open problems in this area and point out future research directions.

  Despite remarkable progress in multimodal models for Visual Question Answering (VQA), there remain major reliability concerns because the models can often be overconfident and miscalibrated, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Plenty has been done to address such issues for unimodal models, but little work exists for multimodal cases. Here, we address unreliability in multimodal models by proposing a Variational VQA approach. Specifically, instead of fine-tuning vision-language models by using AdamW, we employ a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON, which yields a posterior distribution over model parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach improves calibration and abstentions without sacrificing the accuracy of AdamW. For instance, compared to AdamW fine-tuning, we reduce Expected Calibration Error by more than 50% compared to the AdamW baseline and raise Coverage by 4% vs. SOTA (for a fixed risk of 1%). In the presence of distribution shifts, the performance gain is even higher, achieving 8% Coverage (@ 1% risk) improvement vs. SOTA when 50% of test cases are OOD. Overall, we present variational learning as a viable option to enhance the reliability of multimodal models.

  The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements with the introduction of diffusion models. Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.

  Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cardiac image segmentation is an important step in many cardiac image analysis and modeling tasks such as motion tracking or simulations of cardiac mechanics. While deep learning has greatly advanced segmentation in clinical settings, there is limited work on pre-clinical imaging, notably in porcine models, which are often used due to their anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. However, differences between species create a domain shift that complicates direct model transfer from human to pig data.Recently, foundation models trained on large human datasets have shown promise for robust medical image segmentation; yet their applicability to porcine data remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can generate sufficiently accurate pseudo-labels for pig cardiac CT and propose a simple self-training approach to iteratively refine these labels. Our method requires no manually annotated pig data, relying instead on iterative updates to improve segmentation quality. We demonstrate that this self-training process not only enhances segmentation accuracy but also smooths out temporal inconsistencies across consecutive frames. Although our results are encouraging, there remains room for improvement, for example by incorporating more sophisticated self-training strategies and by exploring additional foundation models and other cardiac imaging technologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous vehicles need a complete map of their surroundings to plan and act. This has sparked research into the tasks of 3D occupancy prediction, 3D scene completion, and 3D panoptic scene completion, which predict a dense map of the ego vehicle's surroundings as a voxel grid. Scene completion extends occupancy prediction by predicting occluded regions of the voxel grid, and panoptic scene completion further extends this task by also distinguishing object instances within the same class; both aspects are crucial for path planning and decision-making. However, 3D panoptic scene completion is currently underexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for 3D panoptic scene completion that extends existing 3D semantic scene completion models. We propose an Object Module and Panoptic Module that can easily be integrated with 3D occupancy and scene completion methods presented in the literature. Our approach leverages the available annotations in occupancy benchmarks, allowing individual object shapes to be learned as a differentiable problem. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In imaging inverse problems, we would like to know how close the recovered image is to the true image in terms of full-reference image quality (FRIQ) metrics like PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, etc. This is especially important in safety-critical applications like medical imaging, where knowing that, say, the SSIM was poor could potentially avoid a costly misdiagnosis. But since we don't know the true image, computing FRIQ is non-trivial. In this work, we combine conformal prediction with approximate posterior sampling to construct bounds on FRIQ that are guaranteed to hold up to a user-specified error probability. We demonstrate our approach on image denoising and accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) problems. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is essential for the security of facial recognition systems in diverse scenarios such as payment processing and surveillance. Current multimodal FAS methods often struggle with effective generalization, mainly due to modality-specific biases and domain shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce the \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{m}odal \textbf{D}enoising and \textbf{A}lignment (\textbf{MMDA}) framework. By leveraging the zero-shot generalization capability of CLIP, the MMDA framework effectively suppresses noise in multimodal data through denoising and alignment mechanisms, thereby significantly enhancing the generalization performance of cross-modal alignment. The \textbf{M}odality-\textbf{D}omain Joint \textbf{D}ifferential \textbf{A}ttention (\textbf{MD2A}) module in MMDA concurrently mitigates the impacts of domain and modality noise by refining the attention mechanism based on extracted common noise features. Furthermore, the \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{S}pace \textbf{S}oft (\textbf{RS2}) Alignment strategy utilizes the pre-trained CLIP model to align multi-domain multimodal data into a generalized representation space in a flexible manner, preserving intricate representations and enhancing the model's adaptability to various unseen conditions. We also design a \textbf{U}-shaped \textbf{D}ual \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{U-DSA}) module to enhance the adaptability of representations while maintaining generalization performance. These improvements not only enhance the framework's generalization capabilities but also boost its ability to represent complex representations. Our experimental results on four benchmark datasets under different evaluation protocols demonstrate that the MMDA framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of cross-domain generalization and multimodal detection accuracy. The code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision transformers have demonstrated significant advantages in computer vision tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships through self-attention. However, existing position encoding techniques, which are largely borrowed from natural language processing, fail to effectively capture semantic-aware positional relationships between image patches. Traditional approaches like absolute position encoding and relative position encoding primarily focus on 1D linear position relationship, often neglecting the semantic similarity between distant yet contextually related patches. These limitations hinder model generalization, translation equivariance, and the ability to effectively handle repetitive or structured patterns in images. In this paper, we propose 2-Dimensional Semantic-Aware Position Encoding ($\text{SaPE}^2$), a novel position encoding method with semantic awareness that dynamically adapts position representations by leveraging local content instead of fixed linear position relationship or spatial coordinates. Our method enhances the model's ability to generalize across varying image resolutions and scales, improves translation equivariance, and better aggregates features for visually similar but spatially distant patches. By integrating $\text{SaPE}^2$ into vision transformers, we bridge the gap between position encoding and perceptual similarity, thereby improving performance on computer vision tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) methods show promising results for extracting soccer events from broadcast videos. However, when operated in the high-recall, low-precision regime required for exhaustive event coverage in soccer analytics, their lack of contextual understanding becomes apparent: many false positives could be resolved by considering a broader sequence of actions and game-state information. In this work, we address this limitation by reasoning at the game level and improving STAD through the addition of a denoising sequence transduction task. Sequences of noisy, context-free player-centric predictions are processed alongside clean game state information using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model. By modeling extended temporal context and reasoning jointly over team-level dynamics, our method leverages the "language of soccer" - its tactical regularities and inter-player dependencies - to generate "denoised" sequences of actions. This approach improves both precision and recall in low-confidence regimes, enabling more reliable event extraction from broadcast video and complementing existing pixel-based methods.

  _Yuelin Zhang, Qingpeng Ding, Long Lei, Yongxuan Feng, Raymond Shing-Yan Tang, Shing Shin Cheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a common minimally invasive diagnostic procedure. However, an aspiration needle tracker addressing rapid reciprocating motion is still missing. MrTrack, an aspiration needle tracker with a mamba-based register mechanism, is proposed. MrTrack leverages a Mamba-based register extractor to sequentially distill global context from each historical search map, storing these temporal cues in a register bank. The Mamba-based register retriever then retrieves temporal prompts from the register bank to provide external cues when current vision features are temporarily unusable due to rapid reciprocating motion and imaging degradation. A self-supervised register diversify loss is proposed to encourage feature diversity and dimension independence within the learned register, mitigating feature collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both motorized and manual aspiration datasets demonstrate that MrTrack not only outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in accuracy and robustness but also achieves superior inference efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-training on image-text colonoscopy records offers substantial potential for improving endoscopic image analysis, but faces challenges including non-informative background images, complex medical terminology, and ambiguous multi-lesion descriptions. We introduce Endo-CLIP, a novel self-supervised framework that enhances Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) for this domain. Endo-CLIP's three-stage framework--cleansing, attunement, and unification--addresses these challenges by (1) removing background frames, (2) leveraging large language models to extract clinical attributes for fine-grained contrastive learning, and (3) employing patient-level cross-attention to resolve multi-polyp ambiguities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Endo-CLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pre-training methods in zero-shot and few-shot polyp detection and classification, paving the way for more accurate and clinically relevant endoscopic analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable autonomous driving systems require accurate detection of traffic participants. To this end, multi-modal fusion has emerged as an effective strategy. In particular, 4D radar and LiDAR fusion methods based on multi-frame radar point clouds have demonstrated the effectiveness in bridging the point density gap. However, they often neglect radar point clouds' inter-frame misalignment caused by object movement during accumulation and do not fully exploit the object dynamic information from 4D radar. In this paper, we propose MoRAL, a motion-aware multi-frame 4D radar and LiDAR fusion framework for robust 3D object detection. First, a Motion-aware Radar Encoder (MRE) is designed to compensate for inter-frame radar misalignment from moving objects. Later, a Motion Attention Gated Fusion (MAGF) module integrate radar motion features to guide LiDAR features to focus on dynamic foreground objects. Extensive evaluations on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate that MoRAL outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of 73.30% in the entire area and 88.68% in the driving corridor. Notably, our method also achieves the best AP of 69.67% for pedestrians in the entire area and 96.25% for cyclists in the driving corridor.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is crucial for protecting facial recognition systems from presentation attacks. Previous methods approached this task as a classification problem, lacking interpretability and reasoning behind the predicted results. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities in perception, reasoning, and decision-making in visual tasks. However, there is currently no universal and comprehensive MLLM and dataset specifically designed for FAS task. To address this gap, we propose FaceShield, a MLLM for FAS, along with the corresponding pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, FaceShield-pre10K and FaceShield-sft45K. FaceShield is capable of determining the authenticity of faces, identifying types of spoofing attacks, providing reasoning for its judgments, and detecting attack areas. Specifically, we employ spoof-aware vision perception (SAVP) that incorporates both the original image and auxiliary information based on prior knowledge. We then use an prompt-guided vision token masking (PVTM) strategy to random mask vision tokens, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that FaceShield significantly outperforms previous deep learning models and general MLLMs on four FAS tasks, i.e., coarse-grained classification, fine-grained classification, reasoning, and attack localization. Our instruction datasets, protocols, and codes will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current learning-based methods predict NeRF or 3D Gaussians from point clouds to achieve photo-realistic rendering but still depend on categorical priors, dense point clouds, or additional refinements. Hence, we introduce a novel point cloud rendering method by predicting 2D Gaussians from point clouds. Our method incorporates two identical modules with an entire-patch architecture enabling the network to be generalized to multiple datasets. The module normalizes and initializes the Gaussians utilizing the point cloud information including normals, colors and distances. Then, splitting decoders are employed to refine the initial Gaussians by duplicating them and predicting more accurate results, making our methodology effectively accommodate sparse point clouds as well. Once trained, our approach exhibits direct generalization to point clouds across different categories. The predicted Gaussians are employed directly for rendering without additional refinement on the rendered images, retaining the benefits of 2D Gaussians. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and generalization of our method, which achieves SOTA performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dynamic scene reconstruction for autonomous driving enables vehicles to perceive and interpret complex scene changes more precisely. Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently shown promising capability in scene modeling. However, many existing methods rely heavily on accurate poses inputs and multi-sensor data, leading to increased system complexity. To address this, we propose FreeDriveRF, which reconstructs dynamic driving scenes using only sequential RGB images without requiring poses inputs. We innovatively decouple dynamic and static parts at the early sampling level using semantic supervision, mitigating image blurring and artifacts. To overcome the challenges posed by object motion and occlusion in monocular camera, we introduce a warped ray-guided dynamic object rendering consistency loss, utilizing optical flow to better constrain the dynamic modeling process. Additionally, we incorporate estimated dynamic flow to constrain the pose optimization process, improving the stability and accuracy of unbounded scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in dynamic scene modeling for autonomous driving.

This oversight results in ambiguities between class representation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel federated segmentation framework that strikes class consistency, termed FedSaaS. Specifically, we introduce class exemplars as a criterion for both local- and global-level class representations. On the server side, the uploaded class exemplars are leveraged to model class prototypes, which supervise global branch of clients, ensuring alignment with global-level representation. On the client side, we incorporate an adversarial mechanism to harmonize contributions of global and local branches, leading to consistent output. Moreover, multilevel contrastive losses are employed on both sides to enforce consistency between two-level representations in the same semantic space. Extensive experiments on several driving scene segmentation datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving average segmentation accuracy and effectively addressing the class-consistency representation problem.

  Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback.

  Text-driven motion generation offers a powerful and intuitive way to create human movements directly from natural language. By removing the need for predefined motion inputs, it provides a flexible and accessible approach to controlling animated characters. This makes it especially useful in areas like virtual reality, gaming, human-computer interaction, and robotics. In this review, we first revisit the traditional perspective on motion synthesis, where models focused on predicting future poses from observed initial sequences, often conditioned on action labels. We then provide a comprehensive and structured survey of modern text-to-motion generation approaches, categorizing them from two complementary perspectives: (i) architectural, dividing methods into VAE-based, diffusion-based, and hybrid models; and (ii) motion representation, distinguishing between discrete and continuous motion generation strategies. In addition, we explore the most widely used datasets, evaluation methods, and recent benchmarks that have shaped progress in this area. With this survey, we aim to capture where the field currently stands, bring attention to its key challenges and limitations, and highlight promising directions for future exploration. We hope this work offers a valuable starting point for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of language-driven human motion synthesis.

  Dermatological diagnosis represents a complex multimodal challenge that requires integrating visual features with specialized clinical knowledge. While vision-language pretraining (VLP) has advanced medical AI, its effectiveness in dermatology is limited by text length constraints and the lack of structured texts. In this paper, we introduce MAKE, a Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced vision-language pretraining framework for zero-shot dermatological tasks. Recognizing that comprehensive dermatological descriptions require multiple knowledge aspects that exceed standard text constraints, our framework introduces: (1) a multi-aspect contrastive learning strategy that decomposes clinical narratives into knowledge-enhanced sub-texts through large language models, (2) a fine-grained alignment mechanism that connects subcaptions with diagnostically relevant image features, and (3) a diagnosis-guided weighting scheme that adaptively prioritizes different sub-captions based on clinical significance prior. Through pretraining on 403,563 dermatological image-text pairs collected from education resources, MAKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLP models on eight datasets across zero-shot skin disease classification, concept annotation, and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Our code will be made publicly available at https: //github.com/SiyuanYan1/MAKE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard benchmarks for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo vision algorithms generally focus on model accuracy rather than robustness to image corruptions like noise or rain. Hence, the resilience of models to such real-world perturbations is largely unquantified. To address this, we present RobustSpring, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating robustness to image corruptions for optical flow, scene flow, and stereo models. RobustSpring applies 20 different image corruptions, including noise, blur, color changes, quality degradations, and weather distortions, in a time-, stereo-, and depth-consistent manner to the high-resolution Spring dataset, creating a suite of 20,000 corrupted images that reflect challenging conditions. RobustSpring enables comparisons of model robustness via a new corruption robustness metric. Integration with the Spring benchmark enables public two-axis evaluations of both accuracy and robustness. We benchmark a curated selection of initial models, observing that accurate models are not necessarily robust and that robustness varies widely by corruption type. RobustSpring is a new computer vision benchmark that treats robustness as a first-class citizen to foster models that combine accuracy with resilience. It will be available atthis https URL.

  The success of deep learning in computer vision over the past decade has hinged on large labeled datasets and strong pretrained models. In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

  In this paper, we introduce MultiviewVLM, a vision-language model designed for unsupervised contrastive multiview representation learning of facial emotions from 3D/4D data. Our architecture integrates pseudo-labels derived from generated textual prompts to guide implicit alignment of emotional semantics. To capture shared information across multi-views, we propose a joint embedding space that aligns multiview representations without requiring explicit supervision. We further enhance the discriminability of our model through a novel multiview contrastive learning strategy that leverages stable positive-negative pair sampling. A gradient-friendly loss function is introduced to promote smoother and more stable convergence, and the model is optimized for distributed training to ensure scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiviewVLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can be easily adapted to various real-world applications with minimal modifications.

  Scaling up model and data size have demonstrated impressive performance improvement over a wide range of tasks. Despite extensive studies on scaling behaviors for general-purpose tasks, medical images exhibit substantial differences from natural data. It remains unclear the key factors in developing medical vision foundation models at scale due to the absence of an extensive understanding of scaling behavior in the medical domain. In this paper, we explored the scaling behavior across model sizes, training algorithms, data sizes, and imaging modalities in developing scalable medical vision foundation models by self-supervised learning. To support scalable pretraining, we introduce BioVFM-21M, a large-scale biomedical image dataset encompassing a wide range of biomedical image modalities and anatomies. We observed that scaling up does provide benefits but varies across tasks. Additional analysis reveals several factors correlated with scaling benefits. Finally, we propose BioVFM, a large-scale medical vision foundation model pretrained on 21 million biomedical images, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation models across 12 medical benchmarks. Our results highlight that while scaling up is beneficial for pursuing better performance, task characteristics, data diversity, pretraining methods, and computational efficiency remain critical considerations for developing scalable medical foundation models.

  The growing demand for scalable biodiversity monitoring methods has fuelled interest in remote sensing data, due to its widespread availability and extensive coverage. Traditionally, the application of remote sensing to biodiversity research has focused on mapping and monitoring habitats, but with increasing availability of large-scale citizen-science wildlife observation data, recent methods have started to explore predicting multi-species presence directly from satellite images. This paper presents a new data set for predicting butterfly species presence from satellite data in the United Kingdom. We experimentally optimise a Resnet-based model to predict multi-species presence from 4-band satellite images, and find that this model especially outperforms the mean rate baseline for locations with high species biodiversity. To improve performance, we develop a soft, supervised contrastive regularisation loss that is tailored to probabilistic labels (such as species-presence data), and demonstrate that this improves prediction accuracy. In summary, our new data set and contrastive regularisation method contribute to the open challenge of accurately predicting species biodiversity from remote sensing data, which is key for efficient biodiversity monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. The code and pre-trained models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised reconstruction networks using self-attention transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance for multi-class (unified) anomaly detection with a single model. However, these self-attention reconstruction models primarily operate on target features, which may result in perfect reconstruction for both normal and anomaly features due to high consistency with context, leading to failure in detecting anomalies. Additionally, these models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation. OneNIP outperforms previous methods on three industry anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec, BTAD, and VisA. The code and pre-trained models are available atthis https URL.

  Anomaly detection is a practical and challenging task due to the scarcity of anomaly samples in industrial inspection. Some existing anomaly detection methods address this issue by synthesizing anomalies with noise or external data. However, there is always a large semantic gap between synthetic and real-world anomalies, resulting in weak performance in anomaly detection. To solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen) method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec. The experiments demonstrate that our generated anomalies effectively improve the model performance of both anomaly classification and segmentation tasks simultaneously, \eg, DRAEM and DseTSeg achieved a 5.8\% and 1.5\% improvement in AU-PR metric on segmentation task, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The goal of this paper is to enhance face recognition performance by augmenting head poses during the testing phase. Existing methods often rely on training on frontalised images or learning pose-invariant representations, yet both approaches typically require re-training and testing for each dataset, involving a substantial amount of effort. In contrast, this study proposes Pose-TTA, a novel approach that aligns faces at inference time without additional training. To achieve this, we employ a portrait animator that transfers the source image identity into the pose of a driving image. Instead of frontalising a side-profile face -- which can introduce distortion -- Pose-TTA generates matching side-profile images for comparison, thereby reducing identity information loss. Furthermore, we propose a weighted feature aggregation strategy to address any distortions or biases arising from the synthetic data, thus enhancing the reliability of the augmented images. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and with various pre-trained face recognition models demonstrate that Pose-TTA consistently improves inference performance. Moreover, our method is straightforward to integrate into existing face recognition pipelines, as it requires no retraining or fine-tuning of the underlying recognition models.

  Introduction: Timely identification of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) subtypes on non-contrast computed tomography is critical for prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making, yet remains challenging due to low contrast and blurring boundaries. This study evaluates the performance of zero-shot multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) compared to traditional deep learning methods in ICH binary classification and subtyping. Methods: We utilized a dataset provided by RSNA, comprising 192 NCCT volumes. The study compares various MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2, with conventional deep learning models, including ResNet50 and Vision Transformer. Carefully crafted prompts were used to guide MLLMs in tasks such as ICH presence, subtype classification, localization, and volume estimation. Results: The results indicate that in the ICH binary classification task, traditional deep learning models outperform MLLMs comprehensively. For subtype classification, MLLMs also exhibit inferior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, with Gemini 2.0 Flash achieving an macro-averaged precision of 0.41 and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.31. Conclusion: While MLLMs excel in interactive capabilities, their overall accuracy in ICH subtyping is inferior to deep networks. However, MLLMs enhance interpretability through language interactions, indicating potential in medical imaging analysis. Future efforts will focus on model refinement and developing more precise MLLMs to improve performance in three-dimensional medical image processing.

  Metasurface-based radar absorbing structures (RAS) are highly preferred for applications like stealth technology, electromagnetic (EM) shielding, etc. due to their capability to achieve frequency selective absorption characteristics with minimal thickness and reduced weight penalty. However, the conventional approach for the EM design and optimization of these structures relies on forward simulations, using full wave simulation tools, to predict the electromagnetic (EM) response of candidate meta atoms. This process is computationally intensive, extremely time consuming and requires exploration of large design spaces. To overcome this challenge, we propose a surrogate model that significantly accelerates the prediction of EM responses of multi-layered metasurface-based RAS. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture with Huber loss function has been employed to estimate the reflection characteristics of the RAS model. The proposed model achieved a cosine similarity of 99.9% and a mean square error of 0.001 within 1000 epochs of training. The efficiency of the model has been established via full wave simulations as well as experiment where it demonstrated significant reduction in computational time while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental task in computational photography, aiming to improve illumination, reduce noise, and enhance image quality. While recent advancements focus on designing increasingly complex neural network models, we observe a peculiar phenomenon: resetting certain parameters to random values unexpectedly improves enhancement performance for some images. Drawing inspiration from biological genes, we term this phenomenon the gene effect. The gene effect limits enhancement performance, as even random parameters can sometimes outperform learned ones, preventing models from fully utilizing their capacity. In this paper, we investigate the reason and propose a solution. Based on our observations, we attribute the gene effect to static parameters, analogous to how fixed genetic configurations become maladaptive when environments change. Inspired by biological evolution, where adaptation to new environments relies on gene mutation and recombination, we propose parameter dynamic evolution (PDE) to adapt to different images and mitigate the gene effect. PDE employs a parameter orthogonal generation technique and the corresponding generated parameters to simulate gene recombination and gene mutation, separately. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our techniques. The code will be released to the public.

  Network quantization has proven to be a powerful approach to reduce the memory and computational demands of deep learning models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, traditional quantization methods often rely on access to training data, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios due to privacy, security, or regulatory constraints. Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) emerges as a promising solution, achieving quantization without requiring any real data. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of ZSQ methods and their recent advancements. First, we provide a formal definition of the ZSQ problem and highlight the key challenges. Then, we categorize the existing ZSQ methods into classes based on data generation strategies, and analyze their motivations, core ideas, and key takeaways. Lastly, we suggest future research directions to address the remaining limitations and advance the field of ZSQ. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in-depth survey on ZSQ.

  The growing complexity and scale of visual model pre-training have made developing and deploying multi-task computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems increasingly challenging and resource-intensive. Furthermore, the medical imaging community lacks an open-source CAD platform to enable the rapid creation of efficient and extendable diagnostic models. To address these issues, we propose UniCAD, a unified architecture that leverages the robust capabilities of pre-trained vision foundation models to seamlessly handle both 2D and 3D medical images while requiring only minimal task-specific parameters. UniCAD introduces two key innovations: (1) Efficiency: A low-rank adaptation strategy is employed to adapt a pre-trained visual model to the medical image domain, achieving performance on par with fully fine-tuned counterparts while introducing only 0.17% trainable parameters. (2) Plug-and-Play: A modular architecture that combines a frozen foundation model with multiple plug-and-play experts, enabling diverse tasks and seamless functionality expansion. Building on this unified CAD architecture, we establish an open-source platform where researchers can share and access lightweight CAD experts, fostering a more equitable and efficient research ecosystem. Comprehensive experiments across 12 diverse medical datasets demonstrate that UniCAD consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and deployment efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The core challenge in Camouflage Object Detection (COD) lies in the indistinguishable similarity between targets and backgrounds in terms of color, texture, and shape. This causes existing methods to either lose edge details (such as hair-like fine structures) due to over-reliance on global semantic information or be disturbed by similar backgrounds (such as vegetation patterns) when relying solely on local features. We propose DRRNet, a four-stage architecture characterized by a "context-detail-fusion-refinement" pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and enhances the continuity of object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that DRRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to understand circuit schematics due to their limited recognition capabilities. This could be attributed to the lack of high-quality schematic-netlist training data. Existing work such as AMSnet applies schematic parsing to generate netlists. However, these methods rely on hard-coded heuristics and are difficult to apply to complex or noisy schematics in this paper. We therefore propose a novel net detection mechanism based on segmentation with high robustness. The proposed method also recovers positional information, allowing digital reconstruction of schematics. We then expand AMSnet dataset with schematic images from various sources and create AMSnet 2.0. AMSnet 2.0 contains 2,686 circuits with schematic images, Spectre-formatted netlists, OpenAccess digital schematics, and positional information for circuit components and nets, whereas AMSnet only includes 792 circuits with SPICE netlists but no digital schematics.

  Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models have significantly improved 3D point cloud generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on local feature extraction while overlooking global topological information, such as voids, which are crucial for maintaining shape consistency and capturing complex geometries. To address this limitation, we propose TopoDiT-3D, a Topology-Aware Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck structure for 3D point cloud generation. Specifically, we design the bottleneck structure utilizing Perceiver Resampler, which not only offers a mode to integrate topological information extracted through persistent homology into feature learning, but also adaptively filters out redundant local features to improve training efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TopoDiT-3D outperforms state-of-the-art models in visual quality, diversity, and training efficiency. Furthermore, TopoDiT-3D demonstrates the importance of rich topological information for 3D point cloud generation and its synergy with conventional local feature learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) offer flexible object detection through natural language prompts but suffer from performance variability depending on prompt phrasing. In this paper, we introduce a method for automated prompt refinement using a novel metric called the Contrastive Class Alignment Score (CCAS), which ranks prompts based on their semantic alignment with a target object class while penalizing similarity to confounding classes. Our method generates diverse prompt candidates via a large language model and filters them through CCAS, computed using prompt embeddings from a sentence transformer. We evaluate our approach on challenging object categories, demonstrating that our automatic selection of high-precision prompts improves object detection accuracy without the need for additional model training or labeled data. This scalable and model-agnostic pipeline offers a principled alternative to manual prompt engineering for VLM-based detection systems.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight anomaly detection framework based on color features for surveillance video clips in a high sensitivity tactical mission, aiming to quickly identify and interpret potential threat events under resource-constrained and data-sensitive conditions. The method fuses unsupervised KMeans clustering with RGB channel histogram modeling to achieve composite detection of structural anomalies and color mutation signals in key frames. The experiment takes an operation surveillance video occurring in an African country as a research sample, and successfully identifies multiple highly anomalous frames related to high-energy light sources, target presence, and reflective interference under the condition of no access to the original data. The results show that this method can be effectively used for tactical assassination warning, suspicious object screening and environmental drastic change monitoring with strong deployability and tactical interpretation value. The study emphasizes the importance of color features as low semantic battlefield signal carriers, and its battlefield intelligent perception capability will be further extended by combining graph neural networks and temporal modeling in the future.

  _Guoying Liang, Su Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Big model has emerged as a new research paradigm that can be applied to various down-stream tasks with only minor effort for domain adaption. Correspondingly, this study tackles Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The previous studies declared that SAM is not workable for COD but this study reveals that SAM works if promoted properly, for which we devise a new framework to render point promotions: First, we develop the Promotion Point Targeting Network (PPT-net) to leverage multi-scale features in predicting the probabilities of camouflaged objects' presences at given candidate points over the image. Then, we develop a key point selection (KPS) algorithm to deploy both positive and negative point promotions contrastively to SAM to guide the segmentation. It is the first work to facilitate big model for COD and achieves plausible results experimentally over the existing methods on 3 data sets under 6 metrics. This study demonstrates an off-the-shelf methodology for COD by leveraging SAM, which gains advantage over designing professional models from scratch, not only in performance, but also in turning the problem to a less challenging task, that is, seeking informative but not exactly precise promotions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First, our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities, converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements on complex scene understanding tasks.

  Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is widely adopted in modern vehicles, yet its real-world performance remains underexplored due to proprietary systems and limited data access. This paper presents OpenLKA, the first open, large-scale dataset for LKA evaluation and improvement. It includes 400 hours of driving data from 50+ production vehicle models, collected through extensive road testing in Tampa, Florida and global contributions from thethis http URLdriving community. The dataset spans a wide range of challenging scenarios, including complex road geometries, degraded lane markings, adverse weather, lighting conditions and surrounding traffic. The dataset is multimodal, comprising: i) full CAN bus streams, decoded using custom reverse-engineered DBC files to extract key LKA events (e.g., system disengagements, lane detection failures); ii) synchronized high-resolution dash-cam video; iii) real-time outputs from Openpilot, providing accurate estimates of road curvature and lane positioning; iv) enhanced scene annotations generated by Vision Language Models, describing lane visibility, pavement quality, weather, lighting, and traffic conditions. By integrating vehicle-internal signals with high-fidelity perception and rich semantic context, OpenLKA provides a comprehensive platform for benchmarking the real-world performance of production LKA systems, identifying safety-critical operational scenarios, and assessing the readiness of current road infrastructure for autonomous driving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite recent advances in facial recognition, there remains a fundamental issue concerning degradations in performance due to substantial perspective (pose) differences between enrollment and query (probe) imagery. Therefore, we propose a novel domain adaptive framework to facilitate improved performances across large discrepancies in pose by enabling image-based (2D) representations to infer properties of inherently pose invariant point cloud (3D) representations. Specifically, our proposed framework achieves better pose invariance by using (1) a shared (joint) attention mapping to emphasize common patterns that are most correlated between 2D facial images and 3D facial data and (2) a joint entropy regularizing loss to promote better consistency$\unicode{x2014}$enhancing correlations among the intersecting 2D and 3D representations$\unicode{x2014}$by leveraging both attention maps. This framework is evaluated on FaceScape and ARL-VTF datasets, where it outperforms competitive methods by achieving profile (90$\unicode{x00b0}$$\unicode{x002b}$) TAR @ 1$\unicode{x0025}$ FAR improvements of at least 7.1$\unicode{x0025}$ and 1.57$\unicode{x0025}$, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective dietary monitoring is critical for managing Type 2 diabetes, yet accurately estimating caloric intake remains a major challenge. While continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data, Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation. Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, visual tracking methods based on convolutional neural networks and Transformers have achieved remarkable performance and have been successfully applied in fields such as autonomous driving. However, the numerous security issues exposed by deep learning models have gradually affected the reliable application of visual tracking methods in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to reveal the security vulnerabilities of existing visual trackers through effective adversarial attacks has become a critical problem that needs to be addressed. To this end, we propose an adaptive meta-gradient adversarial attack (AMGA) method for visual tracking. This method integrates multi-model ensembles and meta-learning strategies, combining momentum mechanisms and Gaussian smoothing, which can significantly enhance the transferability and attack effectiveness of adversarial examples. AMGA randomly selects models from a large model repository, constructs diverse tracking scenarios, and iteratively performs both white- and black-box adversarial attacks in each scenario, optimizing the gradient directions of each model. This paradigm minimizes the gap between white- and black-box adversarial attacks, thus achieving excellent attack performance in black-box scenarios. Extensive experimental results on large-scale datasets such as OTB2015, LaSOT, and GOT-10k demonstrate that AMGA significantly improves the attack performance, transferability, and deception of adversarial examples.

  _Yangyi Chen, Hao Peng, Tong Zhang, Heng Ji_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In standard large vision-language models (LVLMs) pre-training, the model typically maximizes the joint probability of the caption conditioned on the image via next-token prediction (NTP); however, since only a small subset of caption tokens directly relates to the visual content, this naive NTP unintentionally fits the model to noise and increases the risk of hallucination. We present PRIOR, a simple vision-language pre-training approach that addresses this issue by prioritizing image-related tokens through differential weighting in the NTP loss, drawing from the importance sampling framework. PRIOR introduces a reference model-a text-only large language model (LLM) trained on the captions without image inputs, to weight each token based on its probability for LVLMs training. Intuitively, tokens that are directly related to the visual inputs are harder to predict without the image and thus receive lower probabilities from the text-only reference LLM. During training, we implement a token-specific re-weighting term based on the importance scores to adjust each token's loss. We implement PRIOR in two distinct settings: LVLMs with visual encoders and LVLMs without visual encoders. We observe 19% and 8% average relative improvement, respectively, on several vision-language benchmarks compared to NTP. In addition, PRIOR exhibits superior scaling properties, as demonstrated by significantly higher scaling coefficients, indicating greater potential for performance gains compared to NTP given increasing compute and data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a novel attention module termed the Differentiable Channel Selection Attention module, or the DCS-Attention module. In contrast with conventional self-attention, the DCS-Attention module features selection of informative channels in the computation of the attention weights. The selection of the feature channels is performed in a differentiable manner, enabling seamless integration with DNN training. Our DCS-Attention is compatible with either fixed neural network backbones or learnable backbones with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS), leading to DCS with Fixed Backbone (DCS-FB) and DCS-DNAS, respectively. Importantly, our DCS-Attention is motivated by the principle of Information Bottleneck (IB), and a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss, which can be optimized by SGD, is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the networks with the DCS-Attention modules. In this manner, a neural network with DCS-Attention modules is capable of selecting the most informative channels for feature extraction so that it enjoys state-of-the-art performance for the Re-ID task. Extensive experiments on multiple person Re-ID benchmarks using both DCS-FB and DCS-DNAS show that DCS-Attention significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of DNNs for person Re-ID, which demonstrates the effectiveness of DCS-Attention in learning discriminative features critical to identifying person identities.

  The rising incidence of skin cancer, coupled with limited public awareness and a shortfall in clinical expertise, underscores an urgent need for advanced diagnostic aids. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in this domain, particularly for distinguishing malignant from benign skin lesions. Leveraging publicly available datasets of skin lesions, researchers have been developing AI-based diagnostic solutions. However, the integration of such computer systems in clinical settings is still nascent. This study aims to bridge this gap by employing a fusion of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, specifically neuro-fuzzy and colonial competition approaches. Applied to dermoscopic images from the ISIC database, our method achieved a notable accuracy of 94% on a dataset of 560 images. These results underscore the potential of our approach in aiding clinicians in the early detection of melanoma, thereby contributing significantly to skin cancer diagnostics.

  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal understanding. This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

  Generative AI offers new opportunities for automating urban planning by creating site-specific urban layouts and enabling flexible design exploration. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments. To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images. This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning workflows and public engagement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Score-based generative models (SBM), also known as diffusion models, are the de facto state of the art for image synthesis. Despite their unparalleled performance, SBMs have recently been in the spotlight for being tricked into creating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent images and non-consensual nudity. Current approaches that prevent unsafe generation are based on the models' own knowledge, and the majority of them require fine-tuning. This article explores the use of external sources for ensuring safe outputs in SBMs. Our safe-for-work (SFW) sampler implements a Conditional Trajectory Correction step that guides the samples away from undesired regions in the ambient space using multimodal models as the source of conditioning. Furthermore, using Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), our method admits user-defined NSFW classes, which can vary in different settings. Our experiments on the text-to-image SBM Stable Diffusion validate that the proposed SFW sampler effectively reduces the generation of explicit content while being competitive with other fine-tuning-based approaches, as assessed via independent NSFW detectors. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the SFW sampler on image quality and show that the proposed correction scheme comes at a minor cost with negligible effect on samples not needing correction. Our study confirms the suitability of the SFW sampler towards aligned SBM models and the potential of using model-agnostic conditioning for the prevention of unwanted images.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a crucial role in the field of artificial intelligence, and their security-related testing has been a prominent research focus. By inputting test cases, the behavior of models is examined for anomalies, and coverage metrics are utilized to determine the extent of neurons covered by these test cases. With the widespread application and advancement of DNNs, different types of neural behaviors have garnered attention, leading to the emergence of various coverage metrics for neural networks. However, there is currently a lack of empirical research on these coverage metrics, specifically in analyzing the relationships and patterns between model depth, configuration information, and neural network coverage. This paper aims to investigate the relationships and patterns of four coverage metrics: primary functionality, boundary, hierarchy, and structural coverage. A series of empirical experiments were conducted, selecting LeNet, VGG, and ResNet as different DNN architectures, along with 10 models of varying depths ranging from 5 to 54 layers, to compare and study the relationships between different depths, configuration information, and various neural network coverage metrics. Additionally, an investigation was carried out on the relationships between modified decision/condition coverage and dataset size. Finally, three potential future directions are proposed to further contribute to the security testing of DNN Models.

  Underwater 3D scene reconstruction is crucial for undewater robotic perception and navigation. However, the task is significantly challenged by the complex interplay between light propagation, water medium, and object surfaces, with existing methods unable to model their interactions accurately. Additionally, expensive training and rendering costs limit their practical application in underwater robotic systems. Therefore, we propose Tensorized Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less memory usage. Extensive experiments on real-world underwater datasets have demonstrated that TUGS can efficiently achieve superior reconstruction quality using a limited number of parameters, making it particularly suitable for memory-constrained underwater UAV applications

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in high-definition \emph{HD} map construction have demonstrated the effectiveness of dense representations, which heavily rely on computationally intensive bird's-eye view \emph{BEV} features. While sparse representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and ultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline detection. Specifically, SparseMeXt-Tiny reaches a mean average precision \emph{mAP} of 55.5% at 32 frames per second \emph{fps}, while SparseMeXt-Base attains 65.2% mAP. Scaling the backbone and decoder further, SparseMeXt-Large achieves an mAP of 68.9% at over 20 fps, establishing a new benchmark for sparse representations in HD map construction. These results underscore the untapped potential of sparse methods, challenging the conventional reliance on dense representations and redefining efficiency-performance trade-offs in the field.

  Driver fatigue poses a significant challenge to railway safety, with traditional systems like the dead-man switch offering limited and basic alertness checks. This study presents an online behavior-based monitoring system utilizing a customised Directed-Graph Neural Network (DGNN) to classify train driver's states into three categories: alert, not alert, and pathological. To optimize input representations for the model, an ablation study was performed, comparing three feature configurations: skeletal-only, facial-only, and a combination of both. Experimental results show that combining facial and skeletal features yields the highest accuracy (80.88%) in the three-class model, outperforming models using only facial or skeletal features. Furthermore, this combination achieves over 99% accuracy in the binary alertness classification. Additionally, we introduced a novel dataset that, for the first time, incorporates simulated pathological conditions into train driver monitoring, broadening the scope for assessing risks related to fatigue and health. This work represents a step forward in enhancing railway safety through advanced online monitoring using vision-based technologies.

  Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks.

We also design an attention module to refine embedding precision.

  Rapid advances in deep learning for computer vision have driven the adoption of RGB camera-based adaptive traffic light systems to improve traffic safety and pedestrian comfort. However, these systems often overlook the needs of people with mobility restrictions. Moreover, the use of RGB cameras presents significant challenges, including limited detection performance under adverse weather or low-visibility conditions, as well as heightened privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose a fully automated, thermal detector-based traffic light system that dynamically adjusts signal durations for individuals with walking impairments or mobility burden and triggers the auditory signal for visually impaired individuals, thereby advancing towards barrier-free intersection for all users. To this end, we build the thermal dataset for people with mobility restrictions (TD4PWMR), designed to capture diverse pedestrian scenarios, particularly focusing on individuals with mobility aids or mobility burden under varying environmental conditions, such as different lighting, weather, and crowded urban settings. While thermal imaging offers advantages in terms of privacy and robustness to adverse conditions, it also introduces inherent hurdles for object detection due to its lack of color and fine texture details and generally lower resolution of thermal images. To overcome these limitations, we develop YOLO-Thermal, a novel variant of the YOLO architecture that integrates advanced feature extraction and attention mechanisms for enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in thermal imaging. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed thermal detector outperforms existing detectors, while the proposed traffic light system effectively enhances barrier-free intersection.

We find that the bounding boxes directly generated with existing SFDA approaches are defective due to the domainthis http URLtackle this issue, we propose a novel Dual Feature Guided (DFG) auto-prompting approach to search for the box prompt. Specifically, the source model is first trained in a feature aggregation phase, which not only preliminarily adapts the source model to the target domain but also builds a feature distribution well-prepared for box prompt search. In the second phase, based on two feature distribution observations, we gradually expand the box prompt with the guidance of the target model feature and the SAM feature to handle the class-wise clustered target features and the class-wise dispersed target features, respectively. To remove the potentially enlarged false positive regions caused by the over-confident prediction of the target model, the refined pseudo-labels produced by SAM are further postprocessed based on connectivity analysis. Experiments on 3D and 2D datasets indicate that our approach yields superior performance compared to conventional methods. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents G-MSGINet, a unified and efficient framework for robust contactless fingerprint recognition that jointly performs minutiae localization and identity embedding directly from raw input images. Existing approaches rely on multi-branch architectures, orientation labels, or complex preprocessing steps, which limit scalability and generalization across real-world acquisition scenarios. In contrast, the proposed architecture introduces the GMSGI layer, a novel computational module that integrates grouped pixel-level involution, dynamic multi-scale kernel generation, and graph-based relational modelling into a single processing unit. Stacked GMSGI layers progressively refine both local minutiae-sensitive features and global topological representations through end-to-end optimization. The architecture eliminates explicit orientation supervision and adapts graph connectivity directly from learned kernel descriptors, thereby capturing meaningful structural relationships among fingerprint regions without fixed heuristics. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely PolyU, CFPose, and Benchmark 2D/3D, demonstrate that G-MSGINet consistently achieves minutiae F1-scores in the range of $0.83\pm0.02$ and Rank-1 identification accuracies between 97.0% and 99.1%, while maintaining an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.5%. These results correspond to improvements of up to 4.8% in F1-score and 1.4% in Rank-1 accuracy when compared to prior methods, using only 0.38 million parameters and 6.63 giga floating-point operations, which represents up to ten times fewer parameters than competitive baselines. This highlights the scalability and effectiveness of G-MSGINet in real-world contactless biometric recognition scenarios.

  Text-to-image synthesis has progressed to the point where models can generate visually compelling images from natural language prompts. Yet, existing methods often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations, or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014 validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints, offering a robust solution for semantically grounded imagethis http URLcode is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional 3D garment creation requires extensive manual operations, resulting in time and labor costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has achieved breakthrough progress in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering, attracting widespread attention and opening new pathways for 3D garment reconstruction. However, due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian primitives, it is difficult to reconstruct high-fidelity, non-watertight 3D garments. In this paper, we present GarmentGS, a dense point cloud-guided method that can reconstruct high-fidelity garment surfaces with high geometric accuracy and generate non-watertight, single-layer meshes. Our method introduces a fast dense point cloud reconstruction module that can complete garment point cloud reconstruction in 10 minutes, compared to traditional methods that require several hours. Furthermore, we use dense point clouds to guide the movement, flattening, and rotation of Gaussian primitives, enabling better distribution on the garment surface to achieve superior rendering effects and geometric accuracy. Through numerical and visual comparisons, our method achieves fast training and real-time rendering while maintaining competitive quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal perception capabilities, garnering significant attention. While numerous evaluation studies have emerged, assessing LVLMs both holistically and on specialized tasks, fine-grained image tasks-fundamental to computer vision-remain largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation benchmark, i.e., FG-BMK, comprising 1.01 million questions and 0.33 million images. Our evaluation systematically examines LVLMs from both human-oriented and machine-oriented perspectives, focusing on their semantic recognition and fine-grained feature representation capabilities. Through extensive experiments on twelve representative LVLMs/VLMs, we uncover key findings regarding the influence of training paradigms, modality alignment, perturbation susceptibility, and fine-grained category reasoning on task performance. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of current LVLMs and offers guidance for future data construction and model design in the development of more advanced LVLMs. Our code is open-source and available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inspired by DeepSeek-R1's success in eliciting reasoning abilities through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce Video-R1 as the first attempt to systematically explore the R1 paradigm for incentivizing video reasoning within multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing ocean front detection methods--including histogram-based variance analysis, Lyapunov exponent, gradient thresholding, and machine learning--suffer from critical limitations: discontinuous outputs, over-detection, reliance on single-threshold decisions, and lack of open-source implementations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Bayesian Front Detection and Tracking framework with Metric Space Analysis (BFDT-MSA). The framework introduces three innovations: (1) a Bayesian decision mechanism that integrates gradient priors and field operators to eliminate manual threshold sensitivity; (2) morphological refinement algorithms for merging fragmented fronts, deleting spurious rings, and thinning frontal zones to pixel-level accuracy; and (3) a novel metric space definition for temporal front tracking, enabling systematic analysis of front evolution. Validated on global SST data (2022--2024), BFDT-MSA reduces over-detection by $73\%$ compared to histogram-based methods while achieving superior intensity ($0.16^\circ$C/km), continuity, and spatiotemporal coherence. The open-source release bridges a critical gap in reproducible oceanographic research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation involves partitioning medical images into meaningful regions, with a focus on identifying anatomical structures and lesions. It has broad applications in healthcare, and deep learning methods have enabled significant advancements in automating this process. Recently, the introduction of the Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), the first foundation model for segmentation task, has prompted researchers to adapt it for the medical domain to improve performance across various tasks. However, SAM's large model size and high GPU requirements hinder its scalability and development in the medical domain. In this work, we propose MCP-MedSAM, a powerful and lightweight medical SAM model designed to be trainable on a single A100 GPU with 40GB of memory within one day while delivering superior segmentation performance. Recognizing the significant internal differences between modalities and the need for direct segmentation target information within bounding boxes, we introduce two kinds of prompts: the modality prompt and the content prompt. After passing through the prompt encoder, their embedding representations can further improve the segmentation performance by incorporating more relevant information without adding significant training overhead. Additionally, we adopt an effective modality-based data sampling strategy to address data imbalance between modalities, ensuring more balanced performance across all modalities. Our method was trained and evaluated using a large-scale challenge dataset, compared to top-ranking methods on the challenge leaderboard, MCP-MedSAM achieved superior performance while requiring only one day of training on a single GPU.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate airway anatomical labeling is crucial for clinicians to identify and navigate complex bronchial structures during bronchoscopy. Automatic airway anatomical labeling is challenging due to significant individual variability and anatomical variations. Previous methods are prone to generate inconsistent predictions, which is harmful for preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel method that enhances topological consistency and improves the detection of abnormal airway branches. We propose a novel approach incorporating two modules: the Soft Subtree Consistency (SSC) and the Abnormal Branch Saliency (ABS). The SSC module constructs a soft subtree to capture clinically relevant topological relationships, allowing for flexible feature aggregation within and across subtrees. The ABS module facilitates the interaction between node features and prototypes to distinguish abnormal branches, preventing the erroneous aggregation of features between normal and abnormal nodes. Evaluated on a challenging dataset characterized by severe airway distortion and atrophy, our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it attains a 91.4% accuracy at the segmental level and an 83.7% accuracy at the subsegmental level, representing a 1.4% increase in subsegmental accuracy and a 3.1% increase in topological consistency. Notably, the method demonstrates reliable performance in cases with disease-induced airway deformities, ensuring consistent and accurate labeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human motion capture from monocular videos has made significant progress in recent years. However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Periorbital distances are critical markers for diagnosing and monitoring a range of oculoplastic and craniofacial conditions. Manual measurement, however, is subjective and prone to intergrader variability. Automated methods have been developed but remain limited by standardized imaging requirements, small datasets, and a narrow focus on individual measurements. We developed a segmentation pipeline trained on a domain-specific dataset of healthy eyes and compared its performance against the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the prior benchmark, PeriorbitAI. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated across multiple disease classes and imaging conditions. We further investigated the use of predicted periorbital distances as features for disease classification under in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, comparing shallow classifiers, CNNs, and fusion models. Our segmentation model achieved state-of-the-art accuracy across all datasets, with error rates within intergrader variability and superior performance relative to SAM and PeriorbitAI. In classification tasks, models trained on periorbital distances matched CNN performance on ID data (77--78\% accuracy) and substantially outperformed CNNs under OOD conditions (63--68\% accuracy vs. 14\%). Fusion models achieved the highest ID accuracy (80\%) but were sensitive to degraded CNN features under OOD shifts. Segmentation-derived periorbital distances provide robust, explainable features for disease classification and generalize better under domain shift than CNN image classifiers. These results establish a new benchmark for periorbital distance prediction and highlight the potential of anatomy-based AI pipelines for real-world deployment in oculoplastic and craniofacial care.

  _Paul Johannes Claasen, Johan Pieter de Villiers_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A novel online MOT algorithm, IMM Joint Homography State Estimation (IMM-JHSE), is proposed. IMM-JHSE uses an initial homography estimate as the only additional 3D information, whereas other 3D MOT methods use regular 3D measurements. By jointly modelling the homography matrix and its dynamics as part of track state vectors, IMM-JHSE removes the explicit influence of camera motion compensation techniques on predicted track position states, which was prevalent in previous approaches. Expanding upon this, static and dynamic camera motion models are combined using an IMM filter. A simple bounding box motion model is used to predict bounding box positions to incorporate image plane information. In addition to applying an IMM to camera motion, a non-standard IMM approach is applied where bounding-box-based BIoU scores are mixed with ground-plane-based Mahalanobis distances in an IMM-like fashion to perform association only, making IMM-JHSE robust to motion away from the ground plane. Finally, IMM-JHSE makes use of dynamic process and measurement noise estimation techniques. IMM-JHSE improves upon related techniques, including UCMCTrack, OC-SORT, C-BIoU and ByteTrack on the DanceTrack and KITTI-car datasets, increasing HOTA by 2.64 and 2.11, respectively, while offering competitive performance on the MOT17, MOT20 and KITTI-pedestrian datasets. Using publicly available detections, IMM-JHSE outperforms almost all other 2D MOT methods and is outperformed only by 3D MOT methods -- some of which are offline -- on the KITTI-car dataset. Compared to tracking-by-attention methods, IMM-JHSE shows remarkably similar performance on the DanceTrack dataset and outperforms them on the MOT17 dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  6D pose estimation aims at determining the object pose that best explains the camera observation. The unique solution for non-ambiguous objects can turn into a multi-modal pose distribution for symmetrical objects or when occlusions of symmetry-breaking elements happen, depending on the viewpoint. Currently, 6D pose estimation methods are benchmarked on datasets that consider, for their ground truth annotations, visual ambiguities as only related to global object symmetries, whereas they should be defined per-image to account for the camera viewpoint. We thus first propose an automatic method to re-annotate those datasets with a 6D pose distribution specific to each image, taking into account the object surface visibility in the image to correctly determine the visual ambiguities. Second, given this improved ground truth, we re-evaluate the state-of-the-art single pose methods and show that this greatly modifies the ranking of these methods. Third, as some recent works focus on estimating the complete set of solutions, we derive a precision/recall formulation to evaluate them against our image-wise distribution ground truth, making it the first benchmark for pose distribution methods on real images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-light image enhancement is an important task in computer vision, essential for improving the visibility and quality of images captured in non-optimal lighting conditions. Inadequate illumination can lead to significant information loss and poor image quality, impacting various applications such as surveillance. photography, or even autonomous driving. In this regard, automated methods have been developed to automatically adjust illumination in the image for a better visual perception. Current enhancement techniques often use specific datasets to enhance low-light images, but still present challenges when adapting to diverse real-world conditions, where illumination degradation may be localized to specific regions. To address this challenge, the Adaptive Light Enhancement Network (ALEN) is introduced, whose main approach is the use of a classification mechanism to determine whether local or global illumination enhancement is required. Subsequently, estimator networks adjust illumination based on this classification and simultaneously enhance color fidelity. ALEN integrates the Light Classification Network (LCNet) for illuminance categorization, complemented by the Single-Channel Network (SCNet), and Multi-Channel Network (MCNet) for precise estimation of illumination and color, respectively. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets for low-light conditions were carried out to underscore ALEN's robust generalization capabilities, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments when compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The ALEN not only enhances image quality in terms of visual perception but also represents an advancement in high-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, as presented in this work.

  In this paper we propose an efficient data-driven solution to self-localization within a floorplan. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent and inherently robust to changes in the visual appearance. Our method does not require retraining per map and location or demand a large database of images of the area of interest. We propose a novel probabilistic model consisting of an observation and a novel temporal filtering module. Operating internally with an efficient ray-based representation, the observation module consists of a single and a multiview module to predict horizontal depth from images and fuses their results to benefit from advantages offered by either methodology. Our method operates on conventional consumer hardware and overcomes a common limitation of competing methods that often demand upright images. Our full system meets real-time requirements, while outperforming the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.

  Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is an important similarity measure between two distributions, used in computer vision and many other application domains. However, its exact calculation is computationally and memory intensive, which hinders its scalability and applicability for large-scale problems. Various approximate EMD algorithms have been proposed to reduce computational costs, but they suffer lower accuracy and may require additional memory usage or manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we present a novel approach, NNS-EMD, to approximate EMD using Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS), in order to achieve high accuracy, low time complexity, and high memory efficiency. The NNS operation reduces the number of data points compared in each NNS iteration and offers opportunities for parallel processing. We further accelerate NNS-EMD via vectorization on GPU, which is especially beneficial for large datasets. We compare NNS-EMD with both the exact EMD and state-of-the-art approximate EMD algorithms on image classification and retrieval tasks. We also apply NNS-EMD to calculate transport mapping and realize color transfer between images. NNS-EMD can be 44x to 135x faster than the exact EMD implementation, and achieves superior accuracy, speedup, and memory efficiency over existing approximate EMD methods.

  This paper develops a new EiHi net to solve the out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization problem in deep learning. EiHi net is a model learning paradigm that can be blessed on any visual backbone. This paradigm can change the previous learning method of the deep model, namely find out correlations between inductive sample features and corresponding categories, which suffers from pseudo correlations between indecisive features and labels. We fuse SimCLR and VIC-Reg via explicitly and dynamically establishing the original - positive - negative sample pair as a minimal learning element, the deep model iteratively establishes a relationship close to the causal one between features and labels, while suppressing pseudo correlations. To further validate the proposed model, and strengthen the established causal relationships, we develop a human-in-the-loop strategy, with few guidance samples, to prune the representation space directly. Finally, it is shown that the developed EiHi net makes significant improvements in the most difficult and typical OoD dataset Nico, compared with the current SOTA results, without any domain ($e.g.$ background, irrelevant features) information.

  In this paper, we investigate an open research task of generating 3D cartoon face shapes from single 2D GAN generated human faces and without 3D supervision, where we can also manipulate the facial expressions of the 3D shapes. To this end, we discover the semantic meanings of StyleGAN latent space, such that we are able to produce face images of various expressions, poses, and lighting conditions by controlling the latent codes. Specifically, we first finetune the pretrained StyleGAN face model on the cartoon datasets. By feeding the same latent codes to face and cartoon generation models, we aim to realize the translation from 2D human face images to cartoon styled avatars. We then discover semantic directions of the GAN latent space, in an attempt to change the facial expressions while preserving the original identity. As we do not have any 3D annotations for cartoon faces, we manipulate the latent codes to generate images with different poses and lighting conditions, such that we can reconstruct the 3D cartoon face shapes. We validate the efficacy of our method on three cartoon datasets qualitatively and quantitatively.

  The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective for learning from graph-structured data through their neighborhood-based message passing framework. Many hierarchical graph clustering pooling methods modify this framework by introducing clustering-based strategies, enabling the construction of more expressive and powerful models. However, all of these message passing framework heavily rely on the connectivity structure of graphs, limiting their ability to capture the rich geometric features inherent in geometric graphs. To address this, we propose Rhomboid Tiling (RT) clustering, a novel clustering method based on the rhomboid tiling structure, which performs clustering by leveraging the complex geometric information of the data and effectively extracts its higher-order geometric structures. Moreover, we design RTPool, a hierarchical graph clustering pooling model based on RT clustering for graph classification tasks. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, outperforming 21 state-of-the-art competitors on all the 7 benchmark datasets.

However, while biases in conventional machine learning models are well documented, it remains unclear how these biases manifest in tabular ICL. The paper investigates the fairness implications of tabular ICL and explores three preprocessing strategies--correlation removal, group-balanced demonstration selection, and uncertainty-based demonstration selection--to address bias. Comprehensive experiments indicate that uncertainty-based demonstration selection consistently enhances group fairness of in-context predictions.

  Our goal is to understand how post-training methods, such as fine-tuning, alignment, and unlearning, modify language model behavior and representations. We are particularly interested in the brittle nature of these modifications that makes them easy to bypass through prompt engineering or relearning. Recent results suggest that post-training induces shallow context-dependent ``circuits'' that suppress specific response patterns. This could be one explanation for the brittleness of post-training. To test this hypothesis, we design an unlearning algorithm, Layered Unlearning (LU), that creates distinct inhibitory mechanisms for a growing subset of the data. By unlearning the first $i$ folds while retaining the remaining $k - i$ at the $i$th of $k$ stages, LU limits the ability of relearning on a subset of data to recover the full dataset. We evaluate LU through a combination of synthetic and large language model (LLM) experiments. We find that LU improves robustness to adversarial relearning for several different unlearning methods. Our results contribute to the state-of-the-art of machine unlearning and provide insight into the effect of post-training updates.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deterministic Rank Reduction Autoencoders (RRAEs) enforce by construction a regularization on the latent space by applying a truncated SVD. While this regularization makes Autoencoders more powerful, using them for generative purposes is counter-intuitive due to their deterministic nature. On the other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are well known for their generative abilities by learning a probabilistic latent space. In this paper, we present Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs), a model that leverages the advantages of both RRAEs and VAEs. Our claims and results show that when carefully sampling the latent space of RRAEs and further regularizing with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (similarly to VAEs), VRRAEs outperform RRAEs and VAEs. Additionally, we show that the regularization induced by the SVD not only makes VRRAEs better generators than VAEs, but also reduces the possibility of posterior collapse. Our results include a synthetic dataset of a small size that showcases the robustness of VRRAEs against collapse, and three real-world datasets; the MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10, over which VRRAEs are shown to outperform both VAEs and RRAEs on many random generation and interpolation tasks based on the FID score.

  _Achref Doula, Max M√ºhl√§user, Alejandro Sanchez Guinea_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\% and collision rates by up to 70\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective: This paper investigates the potential of learnable activation functions in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for personalized control in a lower-limb prosthesis. In addition, user-specific vs. pooled training data is evaluated to improve machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) performance for turn intent prediction.Method: Inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the shank were collected from five individuals with lower-limb amputation performing turning tasks in a laboratory setting. Ability to classify an upcoming turn was evaluated for Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FKAN). The comparison of MLP and KAN (for ML models) and FKAN and CNN (for DL models) assessed the effectiveness of learnable activation functions. Models were trained separately on user-specific and pooled data to evaluate the impact of training data on their performance.Results: Learnable activation functions in KAN and FKAN did not yield significant improvement compared to MLP and CNN, respectively. Training on user-specific data yielded superior results compared to pooled data for ML models ($p < 0.05$). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between user-specific and pooled training for DL models.Significance: These findings suggest that learnable activation functions may demonstrate distinct advantages in datasets involving more complex tasks and larger volumes. In addition, pooled training showed comparable performance to user-specific training in DL models, indicating that model training for prosthesis control can utilize data from multiple participants.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for handling large-scale graph applications. However, the computational demands of GNNs necessitate the development of efficient methods to accelerate inference. Mixed precision quantization emerges as a promising solution to enhance the efficiency of GNN architectures without compromising prediction performance. Compared to conventional deep learning architectures, GNN layers contain a wider set of components that can be quantized, including message passing functions, aggregation functions, update functions, the inputs, learnable parameters, and outputs of these functions. In this paper, we introduce a theorem for efficient quantized message passing to aggregate integer messages. It guarantees numerical equality of the aggregated messages using integer values with respect to those obtained with full (FP32) precision. Based on this theorem, we introduce the Mixed Precision Quantization for GNN (MixQ-GNN) framework, which flexibly selects effective integer bit-widths for all components within GNN layers. Our approach systematically navigates the wide set of possible bit-width combinations, addressing the challenge of optimizing efficiency while aiming at maintaining comparable prediction performance. MixQ-GNN integrates with existing GNN quantization methods, utilizing their graph structure advantages to achieve higher prediction performance. On average, MixQ-GNN achieved reductions in bit operations of 5.5x for node classification and 5.1x for graph classification compared to architectures represented in FP32 precision.

  _Guangtai Wang, Chi-Man Vong, Jintao Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diminishing the impact of false-positive labels is critical for conducting disambiguation in partial label learning. However, the existing disambiguation strategies mainly focus on exploiting the characteristics of individual partial label instances while neglecting the strong supervision information of clean samples randomly lying in the datasets. In this work, we show that clean samples can be collected to offer guidance and enhance the confidence of the most possible candidates. Motivated by the manner of the differentiable count loss strat- egy and the K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm, we proposed a new calibration strategy called CleanSE. Specifically, we attribute the most reliable candidates with higher significance under the assumption that for each clean sample, if its label is one of the candidates of its nearest neighbor in the representation space, it is more likely to be the ground truth of its neighbor. Moreover, clean samples offer help in characterizing the sample distributions by restricting the label counts of each label to a specific interval. Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic benchmarks and 5 real-world PLL datasets showed this calibration strategy can be applied to most of the state-of-the-art PLL methods as well as enhance their performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining the performance of a Deep Neural Network during Neural Architecture Search processes is essential for identifying optimal architectures and hyperparameters. Traditionally, this process requires training and evaluation of each network, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Zero-cost proxies estimate performance without training, serving as an alternative to traditional training. However, recent proxies often lack generalization across diverse scenarios and provide only relative rankings rather than predicted accuracies. To address these limitations, we propose GreenFactory, an ensemble of zero-cost proxies that leverages a random forest regressor to combine multiple predictors' strengths and directly predict model test accuracy. We evaluate GreenFactory on NATS-Bench, achieving robust results across multiple datasets. Specifically, GreenFactory achieves high Kendall correlations on NATS-Bench-SSS, indicating substantial agreement between its predicted scores and actual performance: 0.907 for CIFAR-10, 0.945 for CIFAR-100, and 0.920 for ImageNet-16-120. Similarly, on NATS-Bench-TSS, we achieve correlations of 0.921 for CIFAR-10, 0.929 for CIFAR-100, and 0.908 for ImageNet-16-120, showcasing its reliability in both search spaces.

  _Cunlai Pu, Fangrui Wu, Rajput Ramiz Sharafat, Guangzhao Dai, Xiangbo Shu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Link prediction in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks (UANETs) aims to predict the potential formation of future links between UAVs. In adversarial environments where the route information of UAVs is unavailable, predicting future links must rely solely on the observed historical topological information of UANETs. However, the highly dynamic and sparse nature of UANET topologies presents substantial challenges in effectively capturing meaningful structural and temporal patterns for accurate link prediction. Most existing link prediction methods focus on temporal dynamics at a single structural scale while neglecting the effects of sparsity, resulting in insufficient information capture and limited applicability to UANETs. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale structural-temporal link prediction model (MUST) for UANETs. Specifically, we first employ graph attention networks (GATs) to capture structural features at multiple levels, including the individual UAV level, the UAV community level, and the overall network level. Then, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the temporal dynamics of these multi-scale structural features. Additionally, we address the impact of sparsity by introducing a sophisticated loss function during model optimization. We validate the performance of MUST using several UANET datasets generated through simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MUST achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance in highly dynamic and sparse UANETs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) is a mathematical framework that enables closed-form approximations for minimal training loss and related performance measures in deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper leverages the UFM to provide qualitative insights into neural multivariate regression, a critical task in imitation learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning. Specifically, we address two key questions: (1) How do multi-task models compare to multiple single-task models in terms of training performance? (2) Can whitening and normalizing regression targets improve training performance? The UFM theory predicts that multi-task models achieve strictly smaller training MSE than multiple single-task models when the same or stronger regularization is applied to the latter, and our empirical results confirm these findings. Regarding whitening and normalizing regression targets, the UFM theory predicts that they reduce training MSE when the average variance across the target dimensions is less than one, and our empirical results once again confirm these findings. These findings highlight the UFM as a powerful framework for deriving actionable insights into DNN design and data pre-processing strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision trees and forests have achieved successes in various real applications, most working with all testing classes known in training data. In this work, we focus on learning with augmented class via forests, where an augmented class may appear in testing data yet not in training data. We incorporate information of augmented class into trees' splitting, i.e., a new splitting criterion, called augmented Gini impurity, is introduced to exploit some unlabeled data from testing distribution. We then develop the approach named Learning with Augmented Class via Forests (LACForest), which constructs shallow forests based on the augmented Gini impurity and then splits forests with pseudo-labeled augmented instances for better performance. We also develop deep neural forests with a novel optimization objective based on our augmented Gini impurity, so as to utilize the representation power of neural networks for forests. Theoretically, we present the convergence analysis for augmented Gini impurity, and finally conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Information Bottleneck (IB) method frequently suffers from unstable optimization, characterized by abrupt representation shifts near critical points of the IB trade-off parameter, beta. In this paper, I introduce a novel approach to achieve stable and convex IB optimization through symbolic continuation and entropy-regularized trajectories. I analytically prove convexity and uniqueness of the IB solution path when an entropy regularization term is included, and demonstrate how this stabilizes representation learning across a wide range of \b{eta} values. Additionally, I provide extensive sensitivity analyses around critical points (beta) with statistically robust uncertainty quantification (95% confidence intervals). The open-source implementation, experimental results, and reproducibility framework included in this work offer a clear path for practical deployment and future extension of my proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing demand for large artificial intelligence model (LAIM) services is driving a paradigm shift from traditional cloud-based inference to edge-based inference for low-latency, privacy-preserving applications. In particular, edge-device co-inference, which partitions LAIMs between edge devices and servers, has emerged as a promising strategy for resource-efficient LAIM execution in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate a pruning-aware LAIM co-inference scheme, where a pre-trained LAIM is pruned and partitioned into on-device and on-server sub-models for deployment. For analysis, we first prove that the LAIM output distortion is upper bounded by its parameter distortion. Then, we derive a lower bound on parameter distortion via rate-distortion theory, analytically capturing the relationship between pruning ratio and co-inference performance. Next, based on the analytical results, we formulate an LAIM co-inference distortion bound minimization problem by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio, transmit power, and computation frequency under system latency, energy, and available resource constraints. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to tackle the considered highly non-convex problem. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. In particular, model parameter distortion is shown to provide a reliable bound on output distortion. Also, the proposed joint pruning ratio and resource management design achieves superior performance in balancing trade-offs among inference performance, system latency, and energy consumption compared with benchmark schemes, such as fully on-device and on-server inference. Moreover, the split point is shown to play a critical role in system performance optimization under heterogeneous and resource-limited edge environments.

  This paper presents a novel framework for prioritizing urban green space development in Tehran using diverse socio-economic, environmental, and sensitivity indices. The indices were derived from various sources including Google Earth Engine, air pollution measurements, municipal reports and the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model was used to estimate the air temperature at a 1 km resolution due to insufficient meteorological stations, yielding RMSE and MAE values of 0.96¬∞C and 0.92¬∞C, respectively. After data preparation, several machine learning models were used for binary vegetation cover classification including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest (RF) and Extra Trees. RF achieved the highest performance, exceeding 94% in Overall Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score. Then, the probability of areas lacking vegetation cover was assessed using socio-economic, environmental and sensitivity indices. This resulted in the RF generating an urban green space development prioritization map. Feature Importance Analysis revealed that the most significant indices were nightly land surface temperature (LST) and sensitive population. Finally, the framework performance was validated through microclimate simulation to assess the critical areas after and before the green space development by green roofs. The simulation demonstrated reducing air temperature by up to 0.67¬∞C after utilizing the green roof technology in critical areas. As a result, this framework provides a valuable tool for urban planners to develop green spaces.

  The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has recently emerged as a core element in the 6G networks. However, traditional centralized and synchronous optimization algorithms are unsuitable for SAGIN due to infrastructureless and time-varying environments. This paper aims to develop a novel Asynchronous algorithm a.k.a. Argus for tackling non-convex and non-smooth decentralized federated bilevel learning over SAGIN. The proposed algorithm allows networked agents (e.g. autonomous aerial vehicles) to tackle bilevel learning problems in time-varying networks asynchronously, thereby averting stragglers from impeding the overall training speed. We provide a theoretical analysis of the iteration complexity, communication complexity, and computational complexity of Argus. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through numerical experiments.

  Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics. However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large-scale language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image and natural language understanding. Although scaling up model parameters with increasing volume of training data has progressively improved DNN capabilities, achieving complex cognitive abilities - such as understanding abstract concepts, reasoning, and adapting to novel scenarios, which are intrinsic to human cognition - remains a major challenge. In this study, we show that brain-in-the-loop supervised learning, utilizing a small set of brain signals, can effectively transfer human conceptual structures to DNNs, significantly enhancing their comprehension of abstract and even unseen concepts. Experimental results further indicate that the enhanced cognitive capabilities lead to substantial performance gains in challenging tasks, including few-shot/zero-shot learning and out-of-distribution recognition, while also yielding highly interpretable concept representations. These findings highlight that human-in-the-loop supervision can effectively augment the complex cognitive abilities of large models, offering a promising pathway toward developing more human-like cognitive abilities in artificial systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We developed an AI-driven software solution to quantify metastatic bone disease from WB-DWI scans. Core technologies include: (i) a weakly-supervised Residual U-Net model generating a skeleton probability map to isolate bone; (ii) a statistical framework for WB-DWI intensity normalisation, obtaining a signal-normalised b=900s/mm^2 (b900) image; and (iii) a shallow convolutional neural network that processes outputs from (i) and (ii) to generate a mask of suspected bone lesions, characterised by higher b900 signal intensity due to restricted water diffusion. This mask is applied to the gADC map to extract TDV and gADC statistics. We tested the tool using expert-defined metastatic bone disease delineations on 66 datasets, assessed repeatability of imaging biomarkers (N=10), and compared software-based response assessment with a construct reference standard based on clinical, laboratory and imaging assessments (N=118). Dice score between manual and automated delineations was 0.6 for lesions within pelvis and spine, with an average surface distance of 2mm. Relative differences for log-transformed TDV (log-TDV) and median gADC were below 9% and 5%, respectively. Repeatability analysis showed coefficients of variation of 4.57% for log-TDV and 3.54% for median gADC, with intraclass correlation coefficients above 0.9. The software achieved 80.5% accuracy, 84.3% sensitivity, and 85.7% specificity in assessing response to treatment compared to the construct reference standard. Computation time generating a mask averaged 90 seconds per scan. Our software enables reproducible TDV and gADC quantification from WB-DWI scans for monitoring metastatic bone disease response, thus providing potentially useful measurements for clinical decision-making in APC patients.

  Continual learning for reinforcement learning agents remains a significant challenge, particularly in preserving and leveraging existing information without an external signal to indicate changes in tasks or environments. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of autoencoders in detecting new tasks and matching observed environments to previously encountered ones. Our approach integrates policy optimization with familiarity autoencoders within an end-to-end continual learning system. This system can recognize and learn new tasks or environments while preserving knowledge from earlier experiences and can selectively retrieve relevant knowledge when re-encountering a known environment. Initial results demonstrate successful continual learning without external signals to indicate task changes or reencounters, showing promise for this methodology.

  Predicting the future citation rates of academic papers is an important step toward the automation of research evaluation and the acceleration of scientific progress. We present $\textbf{ForeCite}$, a simple but powerful framework to append pre-trained causal language models with a linear head for average monthly citation rate prediction. Adapting transformers for regression tasks, ForeCite achieves a test correlation of $\rho = 0.826$ on a curated dataset of 900K+ biomedical papers published between 2000 and 2024, a 27-point improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. Comprehensive scaling-law analysis reveals consistent gains across model sizes and data volumes, while temporal holdout experiments confirm practical robustness. Gradient-based saliency heatmaps suggest a potentially undue reliance on titles and abstract texts. These results establish a new state-of-the-art in forecasting the long-term influence of academic research and lay the groundwork for the automated, high-fidelity evaluation of scientific contributions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time series in the context of interpretability of a TSC - a Time Series Classifier. Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to text and image data, are not intuitively understandable to humans. These metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications - how many segments they contain - and to their loyalty - how likely they are to maintain the classification of the original time series. We employ these metrics to evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long. Our findings suggest that using simplifications for interpretability of TSC is much better than using the original time series, particularly when the time series are seasonal, non-stationary and/or with low entropy.

  _David Kinney_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.

  We demonstrate that large language models can effectively self-improve through self-judging without requiring reference solutions, leveraging the inherent asymmetry between generating and verifying solutions. Our experiments on Countdown puzzles and MIT Integration Bee problems show that models can provide reliable reward signals without ground truth answers, enabling reinforcement learning in domains previously not possible. By implementing self-judging, we achieve significant performance gains maintaining alignment with formal verification. When combined with synthetic question generation, we establish a complete self-improvement loop where models generate practice problems, solve them, and evaluate their own performance-achieving an 8% improvement with Qwen 2.5 7B over baseline and surpassing GPT-4o performance on integration tasks. Our findings demonstrate that LLM judges can provide effective reward signals for training models, unlocking many reinforcement learning environments previously limited by the difficulty of creating programmatic rewards. This suggests a potential paradigm shift toward AI systems that continuously improve through self-directed learning rather than human-guided training, potentially accelerating progress in domains with scarce training data or complex evaluation requirements.

  Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural-language processing, yet their scale makes real-world deployment costly. Post-training quantization reduces memory and computation but often degrades accuracy, while quantization-aware training can recover performance at the cost of extra training. Pushing quantization to the ternary (2-bit) regime yields even larger savings but is notoriously unstable. Building on recent work showing that a bias-free, RMS-normalized Transformer with straight-through estimation can reach 1.58-bit precision, we demonstrate that simply inserting RMS normalization before every linear projection and applying a gradual, layer-wise quantization schedule stably fine-tunes full-precision checkpoints into ternary LLMs. Our approach matches or surpasses more elaborate knowledge-distillation pipelines on standard language-modeling benchmarks without adding model complexity. These results indicate that careful normalization alone can close much of the accuracy gap between ternary and full-precision LLMs, making ultra-low-bit inference practical.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research has highlighted the risk of generative model collapse, where performance progressively degrades when continually trained on self-generated data. However, existing exploration on model collapse is limited to single, unimodal models, limiting our understanding in more realistic scenarios, such as diverse multi-modal AI agents interacting autonomously through synthetic data and continually evolving. We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We show that there is a fast algorithm that embeds hierarchical structures in three-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The correlation of data ends up purely encoded in the causal structure. Our model relies solely on oriented token pairs -- local hierarchical signals -- with no access to global symbolic structure. We apply our method to the corpus of \textit{WordNet}. We provide a perfect embedding of the mammal sub-tree including ambiguities (more than one hierarchy per node) in such a way that the hierarchical structures get completely codified in the geometry and exactly reproduce the ground-truth. We extend this to a perfect embedding of the maximal unambiguous subset of the \textit{WordNet} with 82{,}115 noun tokens and a single hierarchy per token. We introduce a novel retrieval mechanism in which causality, not distance, governs hierarchical access. Our results seem to indicate that all discrete data has a perfect geometrical representation that is three-dimensional. The resulting embeddings are nearly conformally invariant, indicating deep connections with general relativity and field theory. These results suggest that concepts, categories, and their interrelations, namely hierarchical meaning itself, is geometric.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and $\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and (iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist within a single, scalable architecture.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning). Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50% with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately, our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effectively modeling time information and incorporating it into applications or models involving chronologically occurring events is crucial. Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerical solvers for PDEs face challenges in balancing computational cost and accuracy, particularly for multiscale and dynamical systems. Neural operators (NOs) can significantly speed up simulations; however, they face challenges such as error accumulation for dynamical systems and limited generalization in multiphysics problems. This work introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates PI-NO with finite element method (FE) through domain decomposition and leverages numerical analysis for time marching. The core innovation lies in efficient coupling FE and NO subdomains via a Schwarz alternating method: regions with complex, nonlinear, or high-gradient behavior are resolved using a pretrained NO, while the remainder is handled by conventional FE. To address the challenges of dynamic systems, we embed a time-stepping scheme directly into the NO architecture, substantially reducing long-term error propagation. Also, an adaptive subdomain evolution strategy enables the ML resolved region to expand dynamically, capturing emerging fine scale features without remeshing. The framework efficacy has been validated across a range of problems, spanning static, quasi-static, and dynamic regimes (e.g., linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, and elastodynamics), demonstrating accelerated convergence (up to 20% improvement in convergence compared to conventional FE coupling) while preserving solution fidelity with error margins consistently below 1%. Our study shows that our hybrid solver: (1) maintains solution continuity across subdomain interfaces, (2) reduces computational costs by eliminating fine mesh requirements, (3) mitigates error accumulation in time dependent simulations, and (4) enables automatic adaptation to evolving physical phenomena. This work bridges the gap between numerical methods and AI-driven surrogates, offering a scalable pathway for high-fidelity multiscale simulations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GPTAQ, a novel finetuning-free quantization method for compressing large-scale transformer architectures. Unlike the previous GPTQ method, which independently calibrates each layer, we always match the quantized layer's output to the exact output in the full-precision model, resulting in a scheme that we call asymmetric calibration. Such a scheme can effectively reduce the quantization error accumulated in previous layers. We analyze this problem using optimal brain compression to derive a close-formed solution. The new solution explicitly minimizes the quantization error as well as the accumulated asymmetry error. Furthermore, we utilize various techniques to parallelize the solution calculation, including channel parallelization, neuron decomposition, and Cholesky reformulation for matrix fusion. As a result, GPTAQ is easy to implement, simply using 20 more lines of code than GPTQ but improving its performance under low-bit quantization. Remarkably, on a single GPU, we quantize a 405B language transformer as well as EVA-02, the rank first vision transformer that achieves 90% pretraining Imagenet accuracy. Code is available at Github.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces TuneNSearch, a hybrid transfer learning and local search approach for addressing different variants of vehicle routing problems (VRP). Recently, multi-task learning has gained much attention for solving VRP variants. However, this adaptability often compromises the performance of the models. To address this challenge, we first pre-train a reinforcement learning model on the multi-depot VRP, followed by a short fine-tuning phase to adapt it to different variants. By leveraging the complexity of the multi-depot VRP, the pre-trained model learns richer node representations and gains more transferable knowledge compared to models trained on simpler routing problems, such as the traveling salesman problem. TuneNSearch employs, in the first stage, a Transformer-based architecture, augmented with a residual edge-graph attention network to capture the impact of edge distances and residual connections between layers. This architecture allows for a more precise capture of graph-structured data, improving the encoding of VRP's features. After inference, our model is also coupled with a second stage composed of a local search algorithm, which yields substantial performance gains with minimal computational overhead added. Results show that TuneNSearch outperforms many existing state-of-the-art models trained for each VRP variant, requiring only one-fifth of the training epochs. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization, achieving high performance across different tasks, distributions and problem sizes, thus addressing a long-standing gap in the literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.

  Spiking Large Language Models have been shown as a good alternative to LLMs in various scenarios. Existing methods for creating Spiking LLMs, i.e., direct training and ANN-SNN conversion, often suffer from performance degradation and relatively high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Fast ANN-SNN conversion strategy (FAS) that transforms LLMs into spiking LLMs in two stages. The first stage employs a full-parameter fine-tuning of pre-trained models, so it does not need any direct training from scratch. The second stage introduces a coarse-to-fine calibration method to reduce conversion errors and improve accuracy. Experiments on both language and vision-language tasks across four different scales of LLMs demonstrate that FAS can achieve state-of-the-art performance yet with significantly reduced inference latency and computational costs. Notably, FAS only takes eight timesteps to achieve an accuracy of 3\% higher than that of the OPT-7B model, while reducing energy consumption by 96.63\%. The source code is available atthis https URL

  Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time, minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg, Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions affecting traffic flow.

  Missing feature values are a significant hurdle for downstream machine-learning tasks such as classification. However, imputation methods for classification might be time-consuming for high-dimensional data, and offer few theoretical guarantees on the preservation of the data distribution and imputation quality, especially for not-missing-at-random mechanisms. First, we propose an imputation approach named F3I based on the iterative improvement of a K-nearest neighbor imputation, where neighbor-specific weights are learned through the optimization of a novel concave, differentiable objective function related to the preservation of the data distribution on non-missing values. F3I can then be chained to and jointly trained with any classifier architecture. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis of imputation quality and data distribution preservation by F3I for several types of missing mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of F3I on several imputation and classification tasks, with applications to drug repurposing and handwritten-digit recognition data.

  In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text-to-image models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems--including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants--demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI-driven content generation.

  Availability attacks, or unlearnable examples, are defensive techniques that allow data owners to modify their datasets in ways that prevent unauthorized machine learning models from learning effectively while maintaining the data's intended functionality. It has led to the release of popular black-box tools (e.g., APIs) for users to upload personal data and receive protected counterparts. In this work, we show that such black-box protections can be substantially compromised if a small set of unprotected in-distribution data is available. Specifically, we propose a novel threat model of protection leakage, where an adversary can (1) easily acquire (unprotected, protected) pairs by querying the black-box protections with a small unprotected dataset; and (2) train a diffusion bridge model to build a mapping between unprotected and protected data. This mapping, termed BridgePure, can effectively remove the protection from any previously unseen data within the same distribution. BridgePure demonstrates superior purification performance on classification and style mimicry tasks, exposing critical vulnerabilities in black-box data protection. We suggest that practitioners implement multi-level countermeasures to mitigate such risks.

  We introduce a novel framework called combinatorial logistic bandits (CLogB), where in each round, a subset of base arms (called the super arm) is selected, with the outcome of each base arm being binary and its expectation following a logistic parametric model. The feedback is governed by a general arm triggering process. Our study covers CLogB with reward functions satisfying two smoothness conditions, capturing application scenarios such as online content delivery, online learning to rank, and dynamic channel allocation. We first propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, CLogUCB, utilizing a variance-agnostic exploration bonus. Under the 1-norm triggering probability modulated (TPM) smoothness condition, CLogUCB achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\kappa KT})$, where $\tilde{O}$ ignores logarithmic factors, $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector, $\kappa$ represents the nonlinearity of the logistic model, and $K$ is the maximum number of base arms a super arm can trigger. This result improves on prior work by a factor of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$. We then enhance CLogUCB with a variance-adaptive version, VA-CLogUCB, which attains a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{KT})$ under the same 1-norm TPM condition, improving another $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ factor. VA-CLogUCB shows even greater promise under the stronger triggering probability and variance modulated (TPVM) condition, achieving a leading $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret, thus removing the additional dependency on the action-size $K$. Furthermore, we enhance the computational efficiency of VA-CLogUCB by eliminating the nonconvex optimization process when the context feature map is time-invariant while maintaining the tight $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$ regret. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared to benchmark algorithms.

  Large Language Models (LLMs), built on Transformer architectures, exhibit remarkable generalization across a wide range of tasks. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks remains resource-intensive due to their extensive parameterization. In this paper, we explore two remarkable phenomena related to the attention mechanism during the fine-tuning of LLMs (where $\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$ denote the weights of the query, key, and value layers, respectively). The first phenomenon, termed "Unequal Importance of Attention Matrices", highlights the impact of fine-tuning different weight matrices. It shows that optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix yields significantly better performance than optimizing the $\mathbf{W}_k$ matrix. Fine-tuning only the $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrices is computationally efficient while delivering results comparable to, or even better than fine-tuning all three matrices ($\mathbf{W}_q$, $\mathbf{W}_k$, and $\mathbf{W}_v$). The second phenomenon,"Attention Matrices with Customized Learning Rate Lead to Better Convergence", emphasizes the importance of assigning distinct learning rates to these matrices. Specifically, a higher learning rate for the $\mathbf{W}_v$ matrix compared to $\mathbf{W}_q$ and $\mathbf{W}_k$ accelerates convergence and improves performance. Building on these insights, we propose a new strategy that improves fine-tuning efficiency in terms of both storage and time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of this approach, supporting our theoretical findings. Our analysis lays the theoretical groundwork for configuring and improving algorithms in LLMs fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world (bio)chemical processes often exhibit stochastic dynamics with non-trivial correlations and state-dependent fluctuations. Model predictive control (MPC) often must consider these fluctuations to achieve reliable performance. However, most process models simply add stationary noise terms to a deterministic prediction. This work proposes using conditional normalizing flows as discrete-time models to learn stochastic dynamics. Normalizing flows learn the probability density function (PDF) of the states explicitly, given prior states and control inputs. In addition to standard least squares (LSQ) objectives, this work derives a marginal log-likelihood (MLL) objective based on the explicit PDF and Markov chain simulations. In a reactor study, the normalizing flow MPC reduces the setpoint error in open and closed-loop cases to half that of a nominal controller. Furthermore, the chance constraints lead to fewer constraint violations than the nominal controller. The MLL objective yields slightly more stable results than the LSQ, particularly for small scenario sets.

  Spectral graph convolution, an important tool of data filtering on graphs, relies on two essential decisions: selecting spectral bases for signal transformation and parameterizing the kernel for frequency analysis. While recent techniques mainly focus on standard Fourier transform and vector-valued spectral functions, they fall short in flexibility to model signal distributions over large spatial ranges, and capacity of spectral function. In this paper, we present a novel wavelet-based graph convolution network, namely WaveGC, which integrates multi-resolution spectral bases and a matrix-valued filter kernel. Theoretically, we establish that WaveGC can effectively capture and decouple short-range and long-range information, providing superior filtering flexibility, surpassing existing graph wavelet neural networks. To instantiate WaveGC, we introduce a novel technique for learning general graph wavelets by separately combining odd and even terms of Chebyshev polynomials. This approach strictly satisfies wavelet admissibility criteria. Our numerical experiments showcase the consistent improvements in both short-range and long-range tasks. This underscores the effectiveness of the proposed model in handling different scenarios. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.

  The task of the multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem is to navigate a team of agents from their start point to the goal points. However, this setup is unsuitable in the assembly line scenario, which is periodic with a long working hour. To address this issue, the study formalizes the streaming MAPF (S-MAPF) problem, which assumes that the agents in the same agent stream have a periodic start time and share the same action sequence. The proposed solution, Agent Stream Conflict-Based Search (ASCBS), is designed to tackle this problem by incorporating a cyclic vertex/edge constraint to handle conflicts. Additionally, this work explores the potential usage of the disjoint splitting strategy within ASCBS. Experimental results indicate that ASCBS surpasses traditional MAPF solvers in terms of runtime for scenarios with prolonged working hours.

  Industrial catastrophes like the Bhopal disaster (1984) and the Aliso Canyon gas leak (2015) demonstrate the urgent need for rapid and reliable plume tracing algorithms to protect public health and the environment. Traditional methods, such as gradient-based or biologically inspired approaches, often fail in realistic, turbulent conditions. To address these challenges, we present a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm designed for localizing multiple airborne pollution sources using a swarm of small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS). Our method models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Game (POMG), employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Action-specific Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADDRQN) that uses full sequences of historical action-observation pairs, effectively approximating latent states. Unlike prior work, we use a general-purpose simulation environment based on the Gaussian Plume Model (GPM), incorporating realistic elements such as a three-dimensional environment, sensor noise, multiple interacting agents, and multiple plume sources. The incorporation of action histories as part of the inputs further enhances the adaptability of our model in complex, partially observable environments. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms conventional approaches. Specifically, our model allows agents to explore only 1.29\% of the environment to successfully locate pollution sources.

  Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests. Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis, including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation. Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important limitations and areas for future research.

  Cognitive abilities, such as Theory of Mind (ToM), play a vital role in facilitating cooperation in human social interactions. However, our study reveals that agents with higher ToM abilities may not necessarily exhibit better cooperative behavior compared to those with lower ToM abilities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel matching coalition mechanism that leverages the strengths of agents with different ToM levels by explicitly considering belief alignment and specialized abilities when forming coalitions. Our proposed matching algorithm seeks to find stable coalitions that maximize the potential for cooperative behavior and ensure long-term viability. By incorporating cognitive insights into the design of multi-agent systems, our work demonstrates the potential of leveraging ToM to create more sophisticated and human-like coordination strategies that foster cooperation and improve overall system performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the robotics community has amassed ever larger and more diverse datasets to train generalist robot policies. However, while these policies achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success, allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data, allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the potential of large prior datasets in robotics. More information atthis https URL

  Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

  While vision-language models have advanced significantly, their application in language-conditioned robotic manipulation is still underexplored, especially for contact-rich tasks that extend beyond visually dominant pick-and-place scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Vision-Tactile-Language-Action model, a novel framework that enables robust policy generation in contact-intensive scenarios by effectively integrating visual and tactile inputs through cross-modal language grounding. A low-cost, multi-modal dataset has been constructed in a simulation environment, containing vision-tactile-action-instruction pairs specifically designed for the fingertip insertion task. Furthermore, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to offer regression-like supervision for the VTLA model, effectively bridging the gap between classification-based next token prediction loss and continuous robotic tasks. Experimental results show that the VTLA model outperforms traditional imitation learning methods (e.g., diffusion policies) and existing multi-modal baselines (TLA/VLA), achieving over 90% success rates on unseen peg shapes. Finally, we conduct real-world peg-in-hole experiments to demonstrate the exceptional Sim2Real performance of the proposed VTLA model.

  _Marcel Torne, Andy Tang, Yuejiang Liu, Chelsea Finn_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning over long sequences of observations and actions is essential for many robotic tasks. Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study policy distillation under privileged information, where a student policy with only partial observations must learn from a teacher with full-state access. A key challenge is information asymmetry: the student cannot directly access the teacher's state space, leading to distributional shifts and policy degradation. Existing approaches either modify the teacher to produce realizable but sub-optimal demonstrations or rely on the student to explore missing information independently, both of which are inefficient. Our key insight is that the student should strategically interact with the teacher --querying only when necessary and resetting from recovery states --to stay on a recoverable path within its own observation space. We introduce two methods: (i) an imitation learning approach that adaptively determines when the student should query the teacher for corrections, and (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that selects where to initialize training for efficient exploration. We validate our methods in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over standard teacher-student baselines in training efficiency and final performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has enabled robots to understand natural language and reason about the semantics in their environments. However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain, handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing several promising directions for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents aUToPath, a unified online framework for global path-planning and control to address the challenge of autonomous navigation in cluttered urban environments. A key component of our framework is a novel hybrid planner that combines pre-computed lattice maps with dynamic free-space sampling to efficiently generate optimal driveable corridors in cluttered scenarios. Our system also features sequential convex programming (SCP)-based model predictive control (MPC) to refine the corridors into smooth, dynamically consistent trajectories. A single optimization problem is used to both generate a trajectory and its corresponding control commands; this addresses limitations of decoupled approaches by guaranteeing a safe and feasible path. Simulation results of the novel planner on randomly generated obstacle-rich scenarios demonstrate the success rate of a free-space Adaptively Informed Trees* (AIT*)-based planner, and runtimes comparable to a lattice-based planner. Real-world experiments of the full system on a Chevrolet Bolt EUV further validate performance in dense obstacle fields, demonstrating no violations of traffic, kinematic, or vehicle constraints, and a 100% success rate across eight trials.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude. This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and 7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on diverse perceptual inputs.

  Recent studies have proved that imitation learning shows strong potential in the field of robotic manipulation. However, existing methods still struggle with precision manipulation task and rely on inefficient image/point cloud observations. In this paper, we explore to introduce SE(3) object pose into imitation learning and propose the pose-guided efficient imitation learning methods for robotic precise insertion task. First, we propose a precise insertion diffusion policy which utilizes the relative SE(3) pose as the observation-action pair. The policy models the source object SE(3) pose trajectory relative to the target object. Second, we explore to introduce the RGBD data to the pose-guided diffusion policy. Specifically, we design a goal-conditioned RGBD encoder to capture the discrepancy between the current state and the goal state. In addition, a pose-guided residual gated fusion method is proposed, which takes pose features as the backbone, and the RGBD features selectively compensate for pose feature deficiencies through an adaptive gating mechanism. Our methods are evaluated on 6 robotic precise insertion tasks, demonstrating competitive performance with only 7-10 demonstrations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can successfully complete precision insertion tasks with a clearance of about 0.01 mm. Experimental results highlight its superior efficiency and generalization capability compared to existing baselines. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  Controlled manipulation of multiple objects whose dynamics are closely linked is a challenging problem within contact-rich manipulation, requiring an understanding of how the movement of one will impact the others. Using the Jenga game as a testbed to explore this problem, we graph-based modeling to tackle two different aspects of the task: 1) block selection and 2) block extraction. For block selection, we construct graphs of the Jenga tower and attempt to classify, based on the tower's structure, whether removing a given block will cause the tower to collapse. For block extraction, we train a dynamics model that predicts how all the blocks in the tower will move at each timestep in an extraction trajectory, which we then use in a sampling-based model predictive control loop to safely pull blocks out of the tower with a general-purpose parallel-jaw gripper. We train and evaluate our methods in simulation, demonstrating promising results towards block selection and block extraction on a challenging set of full-sized Jenga towers, even at advanced stages of the game.

  Precise initialization plays a critical role in the performance of localization algorithms, especially in the context of robotics, autonomous driving, and computer vision. Poor localization accuracy is often a consequence of inaccurate initial poses, particularly noticeable in GNSS-denied environments where GPS signals are primarily relied upon for initialization. Recent advances in leveraging deep neural networks for pose regression have led to significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness, especially in estimating complex spatial relationships and orientations. In this paper, we introduce APR-Transformer, a model architecture inspired by state-of-the-art methods, which predicts absolute pose (3D position and 3D orientation) using either image or LiDAR data. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmark datasets such as the Radar Oxford Robot-Car and DeepLoc datasets. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to include our custom complex APR-BeIntelli dataset. Additionally, we validate the reliability of our approach in GNSS-denied environments by deploying the model in real-time on an autonomous test vehicle. This showcases the practical feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  In recent years, embodied intelligent robotics (EIR) has made significant progress in multi-modal perception, autonomous decision-making, and physical interaction. Some robots have already been tested in general-purpose scenarios such as homes and shopping malls. We aim to advance the research and application of embodied intelligence in industrial scenes. However, current EIR lacks a deep understanding of industrial environment semantics and the normative constraints between industrial operating objects. To address this gap, this paper first reviews the history of industrial robotics and the mainstream EIR frameworks. We then introduce the concept of the embodied intelligent industrial robotics (EIIR) and propose a knowledge-driven EIIR technology framework for industrial environments. The framework includes four main modules: world model, high-level task planner, low-level skill controller, and simulator. We also review the current development of technologies related to each module and highlight recent progress in adapting them to industrial applications. Finally, we summarize the key challenges EIIR faces in industrial scenarios and suggest future research directions. We believe that EIIR technology will shape the next generation of industrial robotics. Industrial systems based on embodied intelligent industrial robots offer strong potential for enabling intelligent manufacturing. We will continue to track and summarize new research in this area and hope this review will serve as a valuable reference for scholars and engineers interested in industrial embodied intelligence. Together, we can help drive the rapid advancement and application of this technology. The associated project can be found atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drones are promising for data collection in precision agriculture, however, they are limited by their battery capacity. Efficient path planners are therefore required. This paper presents a drone path planner trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) on an abstract simulation that uses object detections and uncertain prior knowledge. The RL agent controls the flight direction and can terminate the flight. By using the agent in combination with the drone's flight controller and a detection network to process camera images, it is possible to evaluate the performance of the agent on real-world data. In simulation, the agent yielded on average a 78% shorter flight path compared to a full coverage planner, at the cost of a 14% lower recall. On real-world data, the agent showed a 72% shorter flight path compared to a full coverage planner, however, at the cost of a 25% lower recall. The lower performance on real-world data was attributed to the real-world object distribution and the lower accuracy of prior knowledge, and shows potential for improvement. Overall, we concluded that for applications where it is not crucial to find all objects, such as weed detection, the learned-based path planner is suitable and efficient.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Latent Theory of Mind (LatentToM), a decentralized diffusion policy architecture for collaborative robot manipulation. Our policy allows multiple manipulators with their own perception and computation to collaborate with each other towards a common task goal with or without explicit communication. Our key innovation lies in allowing each agent to maintain two latent representations: an ego embedding specific to the robot, and a consensus embedding trained to be common to both robots, despite their different sensor streams and poses. We further let each robot train a decoder to infer the other robot's ego embedding from their consensus embedding, akin to theory of mind in latent space. Training occurs centrally, with all the policies' consensus encoders supervised by a loss inspired by sheaf theory, a mathematical theory for clustering data on a topological manifold. Specifically, we introduce a first-order cohomology loss to enforce sheaf-consistent alignment of the consensus embeddings. To preserve the expressiveness of the consensus embedding, we further propose structural constraints based on theory of mind and a directional consensus mechanism. Execution can be fully distributed, requiring no explicit communication between policies. In which case, the information is exchanged implicitly through each robot's sensor stream by observing the actions of the other robots and their effects on the scene. Alternatively, execution can leverage direct communication to share the robots' consensus embeddings, where the embeddings are shared once during each inference step and are aligned using the sheaf Laplacian. In our hardware experiments, LatentToM outperforms a naive decentralized diffusion baseline, and shows comparable performance with a state-of-the-art centralized diffusion policy for bi-manual manipulation.

  Due to the deformability of garments, generating a large amount of high-quality data for robotic garment manipulation tasks is highly challenging. In this paper, we present a synthetic garment dataset that can be used for robotic garment folding. We begin by constructing geometric garment templates based on keypoints and applying generative models to generate realistic texture patterns. Leveraging these keypoint annotations, we generate folding demonstrations in simulation and train folding policies via closed-loop imitation learning. To improve robustness, we propose KG-DAgger, which uses a keypoint-based strategy to generate demonstration data for recovering from failures. KG-DAgger significantly improves the model performance, boosting the real-world success rate by 25\%. After training with 15K trajectories (about 2M image-action pairs), the model achieves a 75\% success rate in the real world. Experiments in both simulation and real-world settings validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

  As autonomous robotic systems become increasingly mature, users will want to specify missions at the level of intent rather than in low-level detail. Language is an expressive and intuitive medium for such mission specification. However, realizing language-guided robotic teams requires overcoming significant technical hurdles. Interpreting and realizing language-specified missions requires advanced semantic reasoning. Successful heterogeneous robots must effectively coordinate actions and share information across varying viewpoints. Additionally, communication between robots is typically intermittent, necessitating robust strategies that leverage communication opportunities to maintain coordination and achieve mission objectives. In this work, we present a first-of-its-kind system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) are able to collaboratively accomplish missions specified in natural language while reacting to changes in specification on the fly. We leverage a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled planner to reason over semantic-metric maps that are built online and opportunistically shared between an aerial and a ground robot. We consider task-driven navigation in urban and rural areas. Our system must infer mission-relevant semantics and actively acquire information via semantic mapping. In both ground and air-ground teaming experiments, we demonstrate our system on seven different natural-language specifications at up to kilometer-scale navigation.

  The use of wearable robots has been widely adopted in rehabilitation training for patients with hand motor impairments. However, the uniqueness of patients' muscle loss is often overlooked. Leveraging reinforcement learning and a biologically accurate musculoskeletal model in simulation, we propose a customized wearable robotic controller that is able to address specific muscle deficits and to provide compensation for hand-object manipulation tasks. Video data of a same subject performing human grasping tasks is used to train a manipulation model through learning from demonstration. This manipulation model is subsequently fine-tuned to perform object-specific interaction tasks. The muscle forces in the musculoskeletal manipulation model are then weakened to simulate neurological motor impairments, which are later compensated by the actuation of a virtual wearable robotics glove. Results shows that integrating the virtual wearable robotic glove provides shared assistance to support the hand manipulator with weakened muscle forces. The learned exoglove controller achieved an average of 90.5\% of the original manipulation proficiency.

With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity.To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces RT-cache, a novel trajectorymemory pipeline that accelerates real-world robot inference by leveraging big-data retrieval and learning from experience. While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Characterizing changes in inter-joint coordination presents significant challenges, as it necessitates the examination of relationships between multiple degrees of freedom during movements and their temporal evolution. Existing metrics are inadequate in providing physiologically coherent results that document both the temporal and spatial aspects of inter-joint coordination. In this article, we introduce two novel metrics to enhance the analysis of inter-joint coordination. The first metric, Joint Contribution Variation based on Principal Component Analysis (JcvPCA), evaluates the variation in each joint's contribution during series of movements. The second metric, Joint Synchronization Variation based on Continuous Relative Phase (JsvCRP), measures the variation in temporal synchronization among joints between two movement datasets. We begin by presenting each metric and explaining their derivation. We then demonstrate the application of these metrics using simulated and experimental datasets involving identical movement tasks performed with distinct coordination strategies. The results show that these metrics can successfully differentiate between unique coordination strategies, providing meaningful insights into joint collaboration during movement. These metrics hold significant potential for fields such as ergonomics and clinical rehabilitation, where a precise understanding of the evolution of inter-joint coordination strategies is crucial. Potential applications include evaluating the effects of upper limb exoskeletons in industrial settings or monitoring the progress of patients undergoing neurological rehabilitation.

  Automated poultry processing lines still rely on humans to lift slippery, easily bruised carcasses onto a shackle conveyor. Deformability, anatomical variance, and strict hygiene rules make conventional suction and scripted motions unreliable. We present ChicGrasp, an end--to--end hardware--software co-design for this task. An independently actuated dual-jaw pneumatic gripper clamps both chicken legs, while a conditional diffusion-policy controller, trained from only 50 multi--view teleoperation demonstrations (RGB + proprioception), plans 5 DoF end--effector motion, which includes jaw commands in one shot. On individually presented raw broiler carcasses, our system achieves a 40.6\% grasp--and--lift success rate and completes the pick to shackle cycle in 38 s, whereas state--of--the--art implicit behaviour cloning (IBC) and LSTM-GMM baselines fail entirely. All CAD, code, and datasets will be open-source. ChicGrasp shows that imitation learning can bridge the gap between rigid hardware and variable bio--products, offering a reproducible benchmark and a public dataset for researchers in agricultural engineering and robot learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for reforestation and forest monitoring, including seed dispersal in hard-to-reach terrains. However, a detailed understanding of the forest floor remains a challenge due to high natural variability, quickly changing environmental parameters, and ambiguous annotations due to unclear definitions. To address this issue, we adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a vision foundation model with strong generalization capabilities, to segment forest floor objects such as tree stumps, vegetation, and woody debris. To this end, we employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to fine-tune a small subset of additional model parameters while keeping the original weights fixed. We adjust SAM's mask decoder to generate masks corresponding to our dataset categories, allowing for automatic segmentation without manual prompting. Our results show that the adapter-based PEFT method achieves the highest mean intersection over union (mIoU), while Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA), with fewer parameters, offers a lightweight alternative for resource-constrained UAV platforms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomy in Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery (MIRS) has the potential to reduce surgeon cognitive and task load, thereby increasing procedural efficiency. However, implementing accurate autonomous control can be difficult due to poor end-effector proprioception, a limitation of their cable-driven mechanisms. Although the robot may have joint encoders for the end-effector pose calculation, various non-idealities make the entire kinematics chain inaccurate. Modern vision-based pose estimation methods lack real-time capability or can be hard to train and generalize. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time capable, vision transformer-based pose estimation approach that is trained using end-to-end differentiable kinematics and rendering in simulation. We demonstrate the potential of this method to correct for noisy pose estimates in simulation, with the longer term goal of verifying the sim-to-real transferability of our approach.

  This thesis presents novel algorithms to advance robotic object rearrangement, a critical task for autonomous systems in applications like warehouse automation and household assistance. Addressing challenges of high-dimensional planning, complex object interactions, and computational demands, our work integrates deep learning for interaction prediction, tree search for action sequencing, and parallelized computation for efficiency.

The research further explores combining diverse manipulation primitives, validated extensively through simulated and real-world experiments.

  The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What is a good local description of contact dynamics for contact-rich manipulation, and where can we trust this local description? While many approaches often rely on the Taylor approximation of dynamics with an ellipsoidal trust region, we argue that such approaches are fundamentally inconsistent with the unilateral nature of contact. As a remedy, we present the Contact Trust Region (CTR), which captures the unilateral nature of contact while remaining efficient for computation. With CTR, we first develop a Model-Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm capable of synthesizing local contact-rich plans. Then, we extend this capability to plan globally by stitching together local MPC plans, enabling efficient and dexterous contact-rich manipulation. To verify the performance of our method, we perform comprehensive evaluations, both in high-fidelity simulation and on hardware, on two contact-rich systems: a planar IiwaBimanual system and a 3D AllegroHand system. On both systems, our method offers a significantly lower-compute alternative to existing RL-based approaches to contact-rich manipulation. In particular, our Allegro in-hand manipulation policy, in the form of a roadmap, takes fewer than 10 minutes to build offline on a standard laptop using just its CPU, with online inference taking just a few seconds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In battlefield environments, adversaries frequently disrupt GPS signals, requiring alternative localization and navigation methods. Traditional vision-based approaches like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) involve complex sensor fusion and high computational demand, whereas range-free methods like DV-HOP face accuracy and stability challenges in sparse, dynamic networks. This paper proposes LanBLoc-BMM, a navigation approach using landmark-based localization (LanBLoc) combined with a battlefield-specific motion model (BMM) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Its performance is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art visual localization algorithms integrated with BMM and Bayesian filters, evaluated on synthetic and real-imitated trajectory datasets using metrics including Average Displacement Error (ADE), Final Displacement Error (FDE), and a newly introduced Average Weighted Risk Score (AWRS). LanBLoc-BMM (with EKF) demonstrates superior performance in ADE, FDE, and AWRS on real-imitated datasets. Additionally, two safe navigation methods, SafeNav-CHull and SafeNav-Centroid, are introduced by integrating LanBLoc-BMM(EKF) with a novel Risk-Aware RRT* (RAw-RRT*) algorithm for obstacle avoidance and risk exposure minimization. Simulation results in battlefield scenarios indicate SafeNav-Centroid excels in accuracy, risk exposure, and trajectory efficiency, while SafeNav-CHull provides superior computational speed.

  Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy. Please visit the project website for more details:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot navigation in dynamic, crowded environments poses a significant challenge due to the inherent uncertainties in the obstacle model. In this work, we propose a risk-adaptive approach based on the Conditional Value-at-Risk Barrier Function (CVaR-BF), where the risk level is automatically adjusted to accept the minimum necessary risk, achieving a good performance in terms of safety and optimization feasibility under uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic zone-based barrier function which characterizes the collision likelihood by evaluating the relative state between the robot and the obstacle. By integrating risk adaptation with this new function, our approach adaptively expands the safety margin, enabling the robot to proactively avoid obstacles in highly dynamic environments. Comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing social navigation approaches, and validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reliable simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are necessary for safety-critical autonomous navigation. In the communication-constrained multi-agent setting, navigation systems increasingly use point-to-point range sensors as they afford measurements with low bandwidth requirements and known data association. The state estimation problem for these systems takes the form of range-aided (RA) SLAM. However, distributed algorithms for solving the RA-SLAM problem lack formal guarantees on the quality of the returned estimate. To this end, we present the first distributed algorithm for RA-SLAM that can efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions. Our algorithm, distributed certifiably correct RA-SLAM (DCORA), achieves this via the Riemannian Staircase method, where computational procedures developed for distributed certifiably correct pose graph optimization are generalized to the RA-SLAM problem. We demonstrate DCORA's efficacy on real-world multi-agent datasets by achieving absolute trajectory errors comparable to those of a state-of-the-art centralized certifiably correct RA-SLAM algorithm. Additionally, we perform a parametric study on the structure of the RA-SLAM problem using synthetic data, revealing how common parameters affect DCORA's performance.

  In the area of autonomous driving, navigating off-road terrains presents a unique set of challenges, from unpredictable surfaces like grass and dirt to unexpected obstacles such as bushes and puddles. In this work, we present a novel learning-based local planner that addresses these challenges by directly capturing human driving nuances from real-world demonstrations using only a monocular camera. The key features of our planner are its ability to navigate in challenging off-road environments with various terrain types and its fast learning capabilities. By utilizing minimal human demonstration data (5-10 mins), it quickly learns to navigate in a wide array of off-road conditions. The local planner significantly reduces the real world data required to learn human driving preferences. This allows the planner to apply learned behaviors to real-world scenarios without the need for manual fine-tuning, demonstrating quick adjustment and adaptability in off-road autonomous driving technology.

  Moving large objects, such as furniture or appliances, is a critical capability for robots operating in human environments. This task presents unique challenges, including whole-body coordination to avoid collisions and managing the dynamics of bulky, heavy objects. In this work, we present RobotMover, a learning-based system for large object manipulation that uses human-object interaction demonstrations to train robot control policies. RobotMover formulates the manipulation problem as imitation learning using a simplified spatial representation called the Interaction Chain, which captures essential interaction dynamics in a way that generalizes across different robot bodies. We incorporate this Interaction Chain into a reward function and train policies in simulation using domain randomization to enable zero-shot transfer to real-world robots. The resulting policies allow a Spot robot to manipulate various large objects, including chairs, tables, and standing lamps. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we show that RobotMover achieves strong performance in terms of capability, robustness, and controllability, outperforming both learned and teleoperation baselines. The system also supports practical applications by combining learned policies with simple planning modules to perform long-horizon object transport and rearrangement tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.

  We introduce SPOT, an object-centric imitation learning framework. The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually-crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We systematically evaluate our method on simulation and real-world tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An end-to-end (E2E) visuomotor policy is typically treated as a unified whole, but recent approaches using out-of-domain (OOD) data to pretrain the visual encoder have cleanly separated the visual encoder from the network, with the remainder referred to as the policy. We propose Visual Alignment Testing, an experimental framework designed to evaluate the validity of this functional separation. Our results indicate that in E2E-trained models, visual encoders actively contribute to decision-making resulting from motor data supervision, contradicting the assumed functional separation. In contrast, OOD-pretrained models, where encoders lack this capability, experience an average performance drop of 42\% in our benchmark results, compared to the state-of-the-art performance achieved by E2E policies. We believe this initial exploration of visual encoders' role can provide a first step towards guiding future pretraining methods to address their decision-making ability, such as developing task-conditioned or context-aware encoders.

  Multi-modal end-to-end autonomous driving has shown promising advancements in recent work. By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Research in manipulation of deformable objects is typically conducted on a limited range of scenarios, because handling each scenario on hardware takes significant effort. Realistic simulators with support for various types of deformations and interactions have the potential to speed up experimentation with novel tasks and algorithms. However, for highly deformable objects it is challenging to align the output of a simulator with the behavior of real objects. Manual tuning is not intuitive, hence automated methods are needed. We view this alignment problem as a joint perception-inference challenge and demonstrate how to use recent neural network architectures to successfully perform simulation parameter inference from real point clouds. We analyze the performance of various architectures, comparing their data and training requirements. Furthermore, we propose to leverage differentiable point cloud sampling and differentiable simulation to significantly reduce the time to achieve the alignment. We employ an efficient way to propagate gradients from point clouds to simulated meshes and further through to the physical simulation parameters, such as mass and stiffness. Experiments with highly deformable objects show that our method can achieve comparable or better alignment with real object behavior, while reducing the time needed to achieve this by more than an order of magnitude.
