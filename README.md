- **[Automated Clinical Problem Detection from SOAP Notes using a Collaborative Multi-Agent LLM Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21803)**  `arXiv:2508.21803`  
  _Yeawon Lee, Xiaoyang Wang, Christopher C. Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes, simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

- **[Tree-Guided Diffusion Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21800)**  `arXiv:2508.21800`  
  _Hyeonseong Jeon, Cheolhong Min, Jaesik Park_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process: (1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.

- **[Freeze and Conquer: Reusable Ansatz for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21730)**  `arXiv:2508.21730`  
  _Fabrizio Fagiolo, Nicolo' Vescera_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy: where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters. This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$ cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for 6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of $\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed method.The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and Job-Shop Scheduling.

- **[PosterForest: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration for Scientific Poster Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21720)**  `arXiv:2508.21720`  
  _Jiho Choi, Seojeong Park, Seongjong Song, Hyunjung Shim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency, content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

- **[Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21648)**  `arXiv:2508.21648`  
  _Farhad Abtahi, Mehdi Astaraki, Fernando Seoane_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.

- **[A-MHA*: Anytime Multi-Heuristic A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21637)**  `arXiv:2508.21637`  
  _Ramkumar Natarajan, Muhammad Suhail Saleem, William Xiao, Sandip Aine, Howie Choset, Maxim Likhachev_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA* concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion. Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

- **[Integrating Large Language Models with Network Optimization for Interactive and Explainable Supply Chain Planning: A Real-World Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21622)**  `arXiv:2508.21622`  
  _Saravanan Venkatachalam_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive, explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents, RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction, configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time decision-making.

- **[Scalable Solution Methods for Dec-POMDPs with Deterministic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21595)**  `arXiv:2508.21595`  
  _Yang You, Alex Schutz, Zhikun Li, Bruno Lacerda, Robert Skilton, Nick Hawes_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic actions and observations.In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations conditioned on the state and joint actions.We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address efficiently.

- **[Revisiting Landmarks: Learning from Previous Plans to Generalize over Problem Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21564)**  `arXiv:2508.21564`  
  _Issa Hanou, Sebastijan Dumanƒçiƒá, Mathijs de Weerdt_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain. If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the same domain.

- **[HealthProcessAI: A Technical Framework and Proof-of-Concept for LLM-Enhanced Healthcare Process Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21540)**  `arXiv:2508.21540`  
  _Eduardo Illueca-Fernandez, Kaile Chen, Fernando Seoane, Farhad Abtahi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.

- **[Counterfactual Scenarios for Automated Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21521)**  `arXiv:2508.21521`  
  _Nicola Gigante, Francesco Leofante, Andrea Micheli_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an \ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct practical algorithms in this area.

- **[Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)**  `arXiv:2508.21517`  
  _Sweta Kaman, Ankita Sharma, Romi Banerjee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action, and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity, requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score (restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study, participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct, operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe, middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

- **[MMSearch-Plus: A Simple Yet Challenging Benchmark for Multimodal Browsing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21475)**  `arXiv:2508.21475`  
  _Xijia Tao, Yihua Teng, Xinxing Su, Xinyu Fu, Jihao Wu, Chaofan Tao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure, Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts, signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

- **[Learning Lifted Action Models From Traces of Incomplete Actions and States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21449)**  `arXiv:2508.21449`  
  _Niklas Jansen, Jonas G√∂sgens, Hector Geffner_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right, with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states, and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+, where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+ state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH, constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or ``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

- **[A General Framework of Epistemic Forgetting and its Instantiation by Ranking Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21441)**  `arXiv:2508.21441`  
  _Christoph Beierle, Alexander Hahn, Diana Howey, Gabriele Kern-Isberner, Kai Sauerwald_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

  User-friendly modeling and virtual simulation of urban traffic scenarios with different types of interacting agents such as pedestrians, cyclists and autonomous vehicles remains a challenge. We present CARJAN, a novel tool for semi-automated generation and simulation of such scenarios based on the multi-agent engineering framework AJAN and the driving simulator CARLA. CARJAN provides a visual user interface for the modeling, storage and maintenance of traffic scenario layouts, and leverages SPARQL Behavior Tree-based decision-making and interactions for agents in dynamic scenario simulations in CARLA. CARJAN provides a first integrated approach for interactive, intelligent agent-based generation and simulation of virtual traffic scenarios in CARLA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The focus of AI development has shifted from academic research to practical applications. However, AI development faces numerous challenges at various levels. This article will attempt to analyze the opportunities and challenges of AI from several different perspectives using a structured approach. This article proposes a seven-layer model for AI compute architecture, including Physical Layer, Link Layer, Neural Network Layer, Context Layer, Agent Layer, Orchestrator Layer, and Application Layer, from bottom to top. It also explains how AI computing has evolved into this 7-layer architecture through the three-stage evolution on large-scale language models (LLMs). For each layer, we describe the development trajectory and key technologies. In Layers 1 and 2 we discuss AI computing issues and the impact of Scale-Up and Scale-Out strategies on computing architecture. In Layer 3 we explore two different development paths for LLMs. In Layer 4 we discuss the impact of contextual memory on LLMs and compares it to traditional processor memory. In Layers 5 to 7 we discuss the trends of AI agents and explore the issues in evolution from a single AI agent to an AI-based ecosystem, and their impact on the AI industry. Furthermore, AI development involves not only technical challenges but also the economic issues to build self-sustainable ecosystem. This article analyzes the internet industry to provide predictions on the future trajectory of AI development.

  _Tony Lee, Haoqin Tu, Chi Heem Wong, Zijun Wang, Siwei Yang, Yifan Mai, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety. Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM, with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities. For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available on our website atthis https URL. AHELM is intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added over time.

  _Yi Liao, Yu Gu, Yuan Sui, Zining Zhu, Yifan Lu, Guohua Tang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

- **[Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21320)**  `arXiv:2508.21320`  
  _Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi, Arya Hadizadeh Moghaddam, Dongjie Wang, Zijun Yao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

  In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations, limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic graphical models that encode indistinguishable objects and relations among them use first-order logic constructs to compress a propositional factorised model for more efficient (lifted) inference. To obtain a lifted representation, the state-of-the-art algorithm Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) groups factors that represent matching distributions. In an approximate version using $\varepsilon$ as a hyperparameter, factors are grouped that differ by a factor of at most $(1\pm \varepsilon)$. However, finding a suitable $\varepsilon$ is not obvious and may need a lot of exploration, possibly requiring many ACP runs with different $\varepsilon$ values. Additionally, varying $\varepsilon$ can yield wildly different models, leading to decreased interpretability. Therefore, this paper presents a hierarchical approach to lifted model construction that is hyperparameter-free. It efficiently computes a hierarchy of $\varepsilon$ values that ensures a hierarchy of models, meaning that once factors are grouped together given some $\varepsilon$, these factors will be grouped together for larger $\varepsilon$ as well. The hierarchy of $\varepsilon$ values also leads to a hierarchy of error bounds. This allows for explicitly weighing compression versus accuracy when choosing specific $\varepsilon$ values to run ACP with and enables interpretability between the different models.

  Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) demands verifiable logical coherence and multimodal reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) have shown rapid progress in GPS, their advancement is hindered by the lack of reliable benchmarks and systematic methodologies. A critical challenge is the inherent hallucination in LLMs, which leads to synthetic GPS datasets that are often noisy, unverified, and self-contradictory. To address this, we introduce TrustGeoGen, a data engine that generates formally verified geometric problems to establish a principled and trustworthy benchmark. Our engine integrates four key innovations: 1) Multimodal Alignment, which synchronizes the generation of diagrams, text, and step-by-step solutions; 2) Formal Verification, ensuring all reasoning paths are rule-compliant; 3) Connection Thinking, bridging formal deduction with human-like logical steps; and 4) our \textit{GeoExplore} series algorithms, which produce diverse problem variants with multiple solutions and self-reflective backtracking. Using this engine, we create the GeoTrust-200K dataset and the corresponding GeoTrust-test benchmark, both with guaranteed cross-modal integrity. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models achieve only 45.83\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, highlighting its significant challenge. Furthermore, training on our synthesized data substantially improves model performance on GPS tasks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) benchmarks.

  Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.

  Deriving personalized insights from popular wearable trackers requires complex numerical reasoning that challenges standard LLMs, necessitating tool-based approaches like code generation. Large language model (LLM) agents present a promising yet largely untapped solution for this analysis at scale. We introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), a system leveraging multistep reasoning with code generation and information retrieval to analyze and interpret behavioral health data. To test its capabilities, we create and share two benchmark datasets with over 4000 health insights questions. A 650-hour human expert evaluation shows that PHIA significantly outperforms a strong code generation baseline, achieving 84% accuracy on objective, numerical questions and, for open-ended ones, earning 83% favorable ratings while being twice as likely to achieve the highest quality rating. This work can advance behavioral health by empowering individuals to understand their data, enabling a new era of accessible, personalized, and data-driven wellness for the wider population.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-training with offline data and online fine-tuning using reinforcement learning is a promising strategy for learning control policies by leveraging the best of both worlds in terms of sample efficiency and performance. One natural approach is to initialize the policy for online learning with the one trained offline. In this work, we introduce a policy expansion scheme for this task. After learning the offline policy, we use it as one candidate policy in a policy set. We then expand the policy set with another policy which will be responsible for further learning. The two policies will be composed in an adaptive manner for interacting with the environment. With this approach, the policy previously learned offline is fully retained during online learning, thus mitigating the potential issues such as destroying the useful behaviors of the offline policy in the initial stage of online learning while allowing the offline policy participate in the exploration naturally in an adaptive manner. Moreover, new useful behaviors can potentially be captured by the newly added policy through learning. Experiments are conducted on a number of tasks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code is available atthis https URL

  Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence. PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in 16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the effectiveness of PiCSAR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models (LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the ``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework. Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique: for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

  We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies. The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards (August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

  The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers and potent de-anonymization threats. The survey further explores domain-specific challenges and tailored solutions in critical sectors such as healthcare, law, finance, and education. We investigate advanced methodologies incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims to guide future research directions for both academics and practitioners in this field.

  We present MahaSTS, a human-annotated Sentence Textual Similarity (STS) dataset for Marathi, along with MahaSBERT-STS-v2, a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT model optimized for regression-based similarity scoring. The MahaSTS dataset consists of 16,860 Marathi sentence pairs labeled with continuous similarity scores in the range of 0-5. To ensure balanced supervision, the dataset is uniformly distributed across six score-based buckets spanning the full 0-5 range, thus reducing label bias and enhancing model stability. We fine-tune the MahaSBERT model on this dataset and benchmark its performance against other alternatives like MahaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERT, and IndicSBERT. Our experiments demonstrate that MahaSTS enables effective training for sentence similarity tasks in Marathi, highlighting the impact of human-curated annotations, targeted fine-tuning, and structured supervision in low-resource settings.

  Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media, leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However, their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge, especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level, each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets. The implementation details are available on the project's repository:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a 7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth" in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the "steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure. Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent, logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs. Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political architecture.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and neuroscientific plausibility.

  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment.

  _Alexandre Kabbach_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and best practices.

  With the growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an increasing need for robust evaluation methods, especially in multilingual and non-English contexts. We present an updated version of the BLUEX dataset, now including 2024-2025 exams and automatically generated image captions using state-of-the-art models, enhancing its relevance for data contamination studies in LLM pretraining. Captioning strategies increase accessibility to text-only models by more than 40%, producing 1,422 usable questions, more than doubling the number in the original BLUEX. We evaluated commercial and open-source LLMs and their ability to leverage visual context through captions.

  _Weizhi Gao, Xiaorui Liu, Feiyi Wang, Dan Lu, Junqi Yin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance.

  _Yurie Koga, Shunsuke Kando, Yusuke Miyao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1) with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2 exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset leads to L1 forgetting.

  _Han Yang, Jian Lan, Yihong Liu, Hinrich Sch√ºtze, Thomas Seidl_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2 benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its effectiveness in multilingual settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

  _Muskan Saraf, Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni, Justin Beaudry, Hossein Abedi, Tom Bush_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini" label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks, our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some skills to be more difficult than others.

  _Yoshiki Takenami, Yin Jou Huang, Yugo Murawaki, Chenhui Chu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs, affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric. Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in society.

  In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate (CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset compared to previous methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions. Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level: first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations, including adding, updating, deleting, or taking no operation on memory entries; and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and utilization with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the strongest existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behavior in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive level of general knowledge. However, they often struggle in highly specialized and cost-sensitive domains such as drug discovery and rare disease research due to the lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (PU-ADKA) designed to efficiently enhance domain-specific LLMs by actively engaging domain experts within a fixed budget. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches, PU-ADKA selectively identifies and queries the most appropriate expert from a team, taking into account each expert's availability, knowledge boundaries, and consultation costs. We train PU-ADKA using simulations on PubMed data and validate it through both controlled expert interactions and real-world deployment with a drug development team, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains under strict budget constraints. In addition to outlining our methodological innovations and experimental results, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, CKAD, for cost-effective LLM domain knowledge acquisition to foster further research in this challenging area.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a new frontier for scaling the performance of Large Language Models. In test-time scaling, by using more computational resources during inference, LLMs can improve their reasoning process and task performance. Several approaches have emerged for TTS such as distilling reasoning traces from another model or exploring the vast decoding search space by employing a verifier. The verifiers serve as reward models that help score the candidate outputs from the decoding process to diligently explore the vast solution space and select the best outcome. This paradigm commonly termed has emerged as a superior approach owing to parameter free scaling at inference time and high performance gains. The verifiers could be prompt-based, fine-tuned as a discriminative or generative model to verify process paths, outcomes or both. Despite their widespread adoption, there is no detailed collection, clear categorization and discussion of diverse verification approaches and their training mechanisms. In this survey, we cover the diverse approaches in the literature and present a unified view of verifier training, types and their utility in test-time scaling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities, but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

  Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness, Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1, indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.

  Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt. GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union, Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models, BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo. The source code is available onthis https URL.

  The hallucination of non-existent facts by LLMs is an important problem given its widespread adoption across various applications. Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence. However, these studies focus on the single-problem setting and have not explored the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires accurately answering multiple questions simultaneously. We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25\% in average precision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly shape political discourse, yet exhibit inconsistent responses when challenged. While prior research categorizes LLMs as left- or right-leaning based on single-prompt responses, a critical question remains: Do these classifications reflect stable ideologies or superficial mimicry? Existing methods cannot distinguish between genuine ideological alignment and performative text generation. To address this, we propose a framework for evaluating ideological depth through (1) argumentative consistency and (2) uncertainty quantification. Testing 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test, we classify responses as stable or performative ideological positioning. Results show 95% of left-leaning models and 89% of right-leaning models demonstrate behavior consistent with our classifications across different experimental conditions. Furthermore, semantic entropy strongly validates our classifications (AUROC=0.78), revealing uncertainty's relationship to ideological consistency. Our findings demonstrate that ideological stability is topic-dependent and challenge the notion of monolithic LLM ideologies, and offer a robust way to distinguish genuine alignment from performative behavior.

  Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various downstream tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation. However, the task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought processes. The reward model teaches DeepTrans how to think and free-translate the given sentences during RL. Besides, our RL training does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning LLMs. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

  To succeed in common digital tasks such as web navigation, agents must carry out a variety of specialized tasks such as searching for products or planning a travel route. To tackle these tasks, agents can bootstrap themselves by learning task-specific skills online through interaction with the web environment. In this work, we demonstrate that programs are an effective representation for skills. We propose agent skill induction (ASI), which allows agents to adapt themselves by inducing, verifying, and utilizing program-based skills on the fly. We start with an evaluation on the WebArena agent benchmark and show that ASI outperforms the static baseline agent and its text-skill counterpart by 23.5% and 11.3% in success rate, mainly thanks to the programmatic verification guarantee during the induction phase. ASI also improves efficiency by reducing 10.7-15.3% of the steps over baselines, by composing primitive actions (e.g., click) into higher-level skills (e.g., search product). We then highlight the efficacy of ASI in remaining efficient and accurate under scaled-up web activities. Finally, we examine the generalizability of induced skills when transferring between websites, and find that ASI can effectively reuse common skills, while also updating incompatible skills to versatile website changes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How is the limited capacity of working memory efficiently used to support human linguistic behaviors? In this paper, we propose Strategic Resource Allocation (SRA) as an efficiency principle for memory encoding in sentence processing. The idea is that working memory resources are dynamically and strategically allocated to prioritize novel and unexpected information. From a resource-rational perspective, we argue that SRA is the principled solution to a computational problem posed by two functional assumptions about working memory, namely its limited capacity and its noisy representation. Specifically, working memory needs to minimize the retrieval error of past inputs under the constraint of limited memory resources, an optimization problem whose solution is to allocate more resources to encode more surprising inputs with higher precision. One of the critical consequences of SRA is that surprising inputs are encoded with enhanced representations, and therefore are less susceptible to memory decay and interference. Empirically, through naturalistic corpus data, we find converging evidence for SRA in the context of dependency locality from both production and comprehension, where non-local dependencies with less predictable antecedents are associated with reduced locality effect. However, our results also reveal considerable cross-linguistic variability, suggesting the need for a closer examination of how SRA, as a domain-general memory efficiency principle, interacts with language-specific phrase structures. SRA highlights the critical role of representational uncertainty in understanding memory encoding. It also reimages the effects of surprisal and entropy on processing difficulty from the perspective of efficient memory encoding.

  Tackling toxic behavior in digital communication continues to be a pressing concern for both academics and industry professionals. While significant research has explored toxicity on platforms like social networks and discussion boards, podcasts despite their rapid rise in popularity remain relatively understudied in this context. This work seeks to fill that gap by curating a dataset of political podcast transcripts and analyzing them with a focus on conversational structure. Specifically, we investigate how toxicity surfaces and intensifies through sequences of replies within these dialogues, shedding light on the organic patterns by which harmful language can escalate across conversational turns.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance MT models. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 169K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from various languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.6-3.1 BLEU and 1.0-2.0 COMET scores in En-Zh, and 1.7-2.9 BLEU and 2.1-2.7 COMET scores in En-De. We also conclude the critical difficulties that current LLMs face with this task.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by constructing a thought chain to guide the model in solving the problem with multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we introduce the ``Thought Space Explorer'' (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought exploration view and alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE by surpassing various baseline methods. We also conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Processing long contexts is increasingly important for Large Language Models (LLMs) in tasks like multi-turn dialogues, code generation, and document summarization. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving high long-context performance, low computational complexity, and compatibility with pretrained models -- collectively termed the ``impossible triangle''. We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. E2LLM divides long contexts into chunks, compresses each into soft prompts using a pretrained text encoder, and aligns these representations with a decoder-only LLM via an adapter. To enhance the LLM's reasoning with these soft prompts, we employ two training objectives: encoder output reconstruction and long-context instruction fine-tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that E2LLM not only outperforms 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in effectiveness and efficiency for document summarization and question answering, but also achieves the best performance on LongBench v2 among models of comparable size.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for a variety of use cases, making them adaptable and controllable has become increasingly important, especially for user-facing applications. While the existing literature on LLM adaptation primarily focuses on finding a model (or models) that optimizes a single predefined objective, here we focus on the challenging case where the model must dynamically adapt to diverse -- and often changing -- user preferences. For this, we leverage adaptation methods based on linear weight interpolation, casting them as continuous multi-domain interpolators that produce models with specific prescribed generation characteristics on-the-fly. Specifically, we use low-rank updates to fine-tune a base model to various different domains, yielding a set of anchor models with distinct generation profiles. Then, we use the weight updates of these anchor models to parametrize the entire (infinite) class of models contained within their convex hull. We empirically show that varying the interpolation weights yields predictable and consistent change in the model outputs with respect to all of the controlled attributes. We find that there is little entanglement between most attributes and identify and discuss the pairs of attributes for which this is not the case. Our results suggest that linearly interpolating between the weights of fine-tuned models facilitates predictable, fine-grained control of model outputs with respect to multiple stylistic characteristics simultaneously.

  If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today, would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective, distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively across downstream QA tasks.

  Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

  Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding. In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions. We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made available atthis https URL.

  Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available. Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third, we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed towards oncology use.Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69). Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.

  Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities. Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision (achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1). For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom, heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective, achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523 for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized, high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

  We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, without using any labels or class boundaries.

  Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets, open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset, encouraging further studies in this direction.

  Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget' some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant, this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more OOD.

  GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However, building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents, featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development. It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning. In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps, and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

  Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue, however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints. Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

  Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks. Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on 5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to 21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

  Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:this https URL

  Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to (i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition, we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception range. Our code and model checkpoints are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity, physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline, we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance, reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models. These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient, user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code is publicly available atthis https URL

  Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature, challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction. Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finitethis http URLthis paper, we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

  Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions. While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e. predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports $3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

  Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose models to specialized domains.

  Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion, object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space, enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI reconstruction.

  _Yujin Park, Haejun Chung, Ikbeom Jang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

  _Ziwei Liao, Mohamed Sayed, Steven L. Waslander, Sara Vicente, Daniyar Turmukhambetov, Michael Firman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM) framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM), which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous, destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation (MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets. Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications. Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques: feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions. Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function. Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model, our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

  While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset, we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide future method development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes, where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the effectiveness of our framework.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However, large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring, and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

  Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models, but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data, MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes. However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels (ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD) methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure its computational complexity to validate its suitability for resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by more than 5% in final accuracy.

  A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science.When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects.We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.

Finally, we propose a few novel enhancements, such as a new way to incorporate ground sample distance (GSD) encoding and adaptive view sampling. These enhancements can be used independently on our SatDINO model. Our code and trained models are available at:this https URL.

  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data scarcity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1) Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient, requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose estimators to enhance their performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density, T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols, realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1, the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203 mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger, standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

  _Zhizhong Huang, Xiaoming Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models (e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture \textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only \textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Zhenghao He, Sanchit Sinha, Guangzhi Xiong, Aidong Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers, enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i) distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and (iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse, and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature, future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS) reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism, focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na√Øve fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.

  We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility. This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV, we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments. The project page is available atthis https URL.

  Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks. Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark models and custom tool pose annotation software.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

  We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement, enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency. We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

  This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings, cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5 fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%. Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and further clinical validation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization. To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition, Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

  Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food production and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to anthropogenic and environmental stressors. Scalable, automated monitoring in agricultural environments remains an open challenge due to the difficulty of detecting small, fast-moving, and often camouflaged insects. To address this, we present BuzzSet v1.0, a large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected under real field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7,856 manually verified images with more than 8,000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were produced using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined through human verification with open-source tools. All images were preprocessed into 256 x 256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide baselines using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves strong classification accuracy with F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybees and bumblebees, with minimal confusion between these categories. The unidentified class remains more difficult due to label ambiguity and fewer samples, yet still contributes insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection performance (mAP at 0.50 of 0.559) illustrates the challenging nature of the dataset and its potential to drive advances in small object detection under realistic ecological conditions. Future work focuses on expanding the dataset to version 2.0 with additional annotations and evaluating further detection strategies. BuzzSet establishes a benchmark for ecological computer vision, with the primary challenge being reliable detection of insects frequently camouflaged within natural vegetation, highlighting an open problem for future research.

  Large video language models (LVLMs) have made notable progress in video understanding, spurring the development of corresponding evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Further analyses on context length, context variation, and model scale provide actionable insights for mitigating bias and guiding model enhancement .this https URL

  In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective, from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step. Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built, diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

  Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic (CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data. Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover, Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps, enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08% sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

  Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

  Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs, its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework, Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently maintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.

  Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3) supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences. Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER performance. Our codebase can be found here.

  _Haoyuan Liu, Hiroshi Watanabe_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance. However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution, often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU, we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis. Code is available atthis https URL

  Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.

  Saliency-guided training, which directs model learning to important regions of images, has demonstrated generalization improvements across various biometric presentation attack detection (PAD) tasks. This paper presents its first application to fingerprint PAD. We conducted a 50-participant study to create a dataset of 800 human-annotated fingerprint perceptually-important maps, explored alongside algorithmically-generated "pseudosaliency," including minutiae-based, image quality-based, and autoencoder-based saliency maps. Evaluating on the 2021 Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition testing set, we explore various configurations within five distinct training scenarios to assess the impact of saliency-guided training on accuracy and generalization. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of saliency-guided training for fingerprint PAD in both limited and large data contexts, and we present a configuration capable of earning the first place on the LivDet-2021 benchmark. Our results highlight saliency-guided training's promise for increased model generalization capabilities, its effectiveness when data is limited, and its potential to scale to larger datasets in fingerprint PAD. All collected saliency data and trained models are released with the paper to support reproducible research.

  Digital technology plays a crucial role in designing customized medical devices, such as occlusal splints, commonly used in the management of disorders of the stomatognathic system. This methodological proof-of-concept study presents a computer-aided approach for designing and evaluating occlusal positioning splints. The primary aim is to demonstrate the feasibility and geometric accuracy of the proposed method at the preclinical stage. In this approach, a three-dimensional splint is generated using a transformation matrix to represent the therapeutic mandibular position. An experienced operator defines this position using a virtual patient model reconstructed from intraoral scans, CBCT, 3D facial scans, and a digitized plaster model. We introduce a novel method for generating splints that reproduces occlusal conditions in the therapeutic position and resolves surface conflicts through virtual embossing. The process for obtaining transformation matrices using dental tools and intraoral devices commonly employed in dental and laboratory workflows is described, and the geometric accuracy of both designed and printed splints is evaluated using profile and surface deviation analysis. The method supports reproducible, patient-specific splint fabrication and provides a transparent foundation for future validation studies, supporting multimodal image registration and quantification of occlusal discrepancies in research settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGB-based novel object pose estimation is critical for rapid deployment in robotic applications, yet zero-shot generalization remains a key challenge. In this paper, we introduce PicoPose, a novel framework designed to tackle this task using a three-stage pixel-to-pixel correspondence learning process. Firstly, PicoPose matches features from the RGB observation with those from rendered object templates, identifying the best-matched template and establishing coarse correspondences. Secondly, PicoPose smooths the correspondences by globally regressing a 2D affine transformation, including in-plane rotation, scale, and 2D translation, from the coarse correspondence map. Thirdly, PicoPose applies the affine transformation to the feature map of the best-matched template and learns correspondence offsets within local regions to achieve fine-grained correspondences. By progressively refining the correspondences, PicoPose significantly improves the accuracy of object poses computed via PnP/RANSAC. PicoPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on the seven core datasets of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating exceptional generalization to novel objects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to compress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

  Identifying anatomical landmarks in 3D dental models is essential for orthodontic treatment, yet manual placement is labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge. While machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), none provide a fully end-to-end solution that avoids costly tooth segmentation.We present CHaRM (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Methodology), the first fully end-to-end deep learning approach for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS. CHaRM integrates four components: a point cloud encoder, a decoder with a heatmap regression head, a teeth-presence classification head, and the novel CHaR module. The CHaR module leverages teeth-presence information to adapt to missing teeth, improving detection accuracy in complex dental cases. Unlike two-stage workflows that segment teeth before landmarking, CHaRM operates directly on IOS point clouds, reducing complexity, avoiding error propagation, and lowering computational cost.We evaluated CHaRM with five point cloud learning backbones on IOSLandmarks-1k, a new dataset of 1,214 annotated 3D dental models. Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the scarcity of open data in orthodontics and foster reproducible research.CHaRM with PointMLP, named CHaRNet, achieved the best accuracy and efficiency. Compared to state-of-the-art methods (TSMDL and ALIIOS), CHaRNet reduced mean Euclidean distance error to 0.56 mm on standard dental models and 1.12 mm across all dentition type, while delivering up to 14.8x faster inference on GPU. This end-to-end approach streamlines orthodontic workflows, enhances the precision of 3D IOS analysis, and enables efficient computer-assisted treatment planning.

  Histopathology, the microscopic examination of tissue samples, is essential for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Accurate segmentation and identification of key regions in histopathology images are crucial for developing automated solutions. However, state-of-art deep learning segmentation methods like UNet require extensive labels, which is both costly and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with multiple stainings. To mitigate this, various multi-stain segmentation methods such as UDA-GAN have been developed, which reduce the need for labels by requiring only one (source) stain to be labelled. Nonetheless, obtaining source stain labels can still be challenging, and segmentation models fail when they are unavailable. This article shows that through self-supervised pre-training$-$including SimCLR, BYOL, and a novel approach, HR-CS-CO$-$the performance of these segmentation methods (UNet, and UDAGAN) can be retained even with 95% fewer labels. Notably, with self-supervised pre-training and using only 5% labels, the performance drops are minimal: 5.9% for UNet and 6.2% for UDAGAN, compared to their respective fully supervised counterparts (without pre-training, using 100% labels). Furthermore, these findings are shown to generalise beyond their training distribution to public benchmark datasets. Im-

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Guidance is a widely used technique for diffusion models to enhance sample quality. Technically, guidance is realised by using an auxiliary model that generalises more broadly than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we first show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar but stronger generalisation errors than the primary model. Based on this insight, we introduce \emph{masked sliding window guidance (M-SWG)}, a novel, training-free method. M-SWG upweights long-range spatial dependencies by guiding the primary model with itself by selectively restricting its receptive field. M-SWG requires neither access to model weights from previous iterations, additional training, nor class conditioning. M-SWG achieves a superior Inception score (IS) compared to previous state-of-the-art training-free approaches, without introducing sample oversaturation. In conjunction with existing guidance methods, M-SWG reaches state-of-the-art Frechet DINOv2 distance on ImageNet using EDM2-XXL and DiT-XL. The code is available atthis https URL.

  In recent years, the talking head generation has become a focal point for researchers. Considerable effort is being made to refine lip-sync motion, capture expressive facial expressions, generate natural head poses, and achieve high-quality video. However, no single model has yet achieved equivalence across all quantitative and qualitative metrics. We introduce Jamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba model, to animate a 3D face. Mamba, a pioneering Structured State Space Model (SSM) architecture, was developed to overcome the limitations of conventional Transformer architectures, particularly in handling long sequences. This challenge has constrained traditional models. Jamba combines the advantages of both the Transformer and Mamba approaches, offering a comprehensive solution. Based on the foundational Jamba block, we present JambaTalk to enhance motion variety and lip sync through multimodal integration. Extensive experiments reveal that our method achieves performance comparable or superior to state-of-the-art models.

  Action recognition (AR) in industrial environments -- particularly for identifying actions and operational gestures -- faces persistent challenges due to high deployment costs, poor cross-scenario generalization, and limited real-time performance. To address these issues, we propose a low-cost real-time framework for industrial action recognition using foundation models, denoted as LRIAR, to enhance recognition accuracy and transferability while minimizing human annotation and computational overhead. The proposed framework constructs an automatically labeled dataset by coupling Grounding DINO with the pretrained BLIP-2 image encoder, enabling efficient and scalable action labeling. Leveraging the constructed dataset, we train YOLOv5 for real-time action detection, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier is deceloped via LoRA-based fine-tuning for action classification. Extensive experiments conducted in real-world industrial settings validate the effectiveness of LRIAR, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy, scenario generalization, and deployment efficiency.

However, organs such as the large intestine remain particularly challenging due to their complex geometry and shape variability. We propose CLAP, a novel Conditional LAtent Point-diffusion model that combines geometric deep learning with denoising diffusion models to enhance 3D representations of the large intestine. Given point clouds sampled from segmentation masks, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to learn both global and local latent shape representations. Two conditional diffusion models operate within this latent space to refine the organ shape. A pretrained surface reconstruction model is then used to convert the refined point clouds into meshes. CLAP achieves substantial improvements in shape modeling accuracy, reducing Chamfer distance by 26% and Hausdorff distance by 36% relative to the initial suboptimal shapes. This approach offers a robust and extensible solution for high-fidelity organ modeling, with potential applicability to a wide range of anatomical structures.

  As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R√©nyi differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

  _Jessica Liang, Anirudh Bharadwaj_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors -- training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning, standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

  _Xiaoyang Wang, Christopher C. Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset, ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm the practical value of our model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets. Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed framework.

  Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being, quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$ for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

  _Barƒ±≈ü Z√∂ng√ºr, Robin Hesse, Stefan Roth_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD). In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components, which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

  _Yunwoo Kim, Junhyuk Hwang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement (comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains 600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics. A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets. Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2). Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature set.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms, Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about Gaussian processes, is assumed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy, especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address these challenges.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first, and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets. The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process, while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data and managing bias.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs' capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions (enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative electrode placement aimed at minimizing noise and motion artifacts, thereby enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15 healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure equitable and reliable cardiac diagnostics in wearable health technologies.

  _Geri Skenderi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power control on embedded and wearable devices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance. Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation, instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory, performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.

  Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug discovery applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training. To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method. Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile communication networks as well as transportation networks.

  We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

  Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually) promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning rate choices.

  Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named \textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First, these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across various evaluation metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling, effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features) of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$ globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$ thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction. On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a tunable, distribution-aware family.

  _Amit Sinha, Matthieu Geist, Aditya Mahajan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed theoretical limit.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch. Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Shihao Ji, Zihui Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory, G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data ("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's effectiveness and domain-generality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG) signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream (DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

  _Ashok Devireddy, Shunping Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM (Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop, continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic, context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model, validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

  _Roland Arnold_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy, overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference. Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods (Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors, while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the first examples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data. Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

  Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with IG.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual learning.

  Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs, exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods remain effective.

  Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten}, several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful unlearning performance.

  Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries (in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

  The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction, parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system, we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous data.

  This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization. The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature), 31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks. Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

  Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive optimization in large models.

  Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

  Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches; however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny) from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted. (iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10 ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion classification.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes, RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial, feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes, imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms. These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches, and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical intelligence.

  Short text clustering is a known use case in the text analytics community. When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g. Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword') approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing entity variations.

  Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we fine-tuneForge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical use of instance-level MIP embeddings atthis https URL.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.

  Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency. However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches. Code is available atthis https URL.

  We introduce CMPhysBench, designed to assess the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Condensed Matter Physics, as a novel Benchmark. CMPhysBench is composed of more than 520 graduate-level meticulously curated questions covering both representative subfields and foundational theoretical frameworks of condensed matter physics, such as magnetism, superconductivity, strongly correlated systems, etc. To ensure a deep understanding of the problem-solving process,we focus exclusively on calculation problems, requiring LLMs to independently generate comprehensive solutions. Meanwhile, leveraging tree-based representations of expressions, we introduce the Scalable Expression Edit Distance (SEED) score, which provides fine-grained (non-binary) partial credit and yields a more accurate assessment of similarity between prediction and ground-truth. Our results show that even the best models, Grok-4, reach only 36 average SEED score and 28% accuracy on CMPhysBench, underscoring a significant capability gap, especially for this practical and frontier domain relative to traditional physics. The code anddataset are publicly available atthis https URL.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have leveraged increased test-time computation to enhance reasoning capabilities, a strategy that, while effective, incurs significant latency and resource costs, limiting their applicability in real-world time-constrained or cost-sensitive scenarios. This paper introduces BudgetThinker, a novel framework designed to empower LLMs with budget-aware reasoning, enabling precise control over the length of their thought processes. We propose a methodology that periodically inserts special control tokens during inference to continuously inform the model of its remaining token budget. This approach is coupled with a comprehensive two-stage training pipeline, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to familiarize the model with budget constraints, followed by a curriculum-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase that utilizes a length-aware reward function to optimize for both accuracy and budget adherence. We demonstrate that BudgetThinker significantly surpasses strong baselines in maintaining performance across a variety of reasoning budgets on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Our method provides a scalable and effective solution for developing efficient and controllable LLM reasoning, making advanced models more practical for deployment in resource-constrained and real-time environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting, requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators, while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging, misspecified environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains. However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood, particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates, while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism, reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100 parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations, resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting appropriate initial conditions.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models, which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge, we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator, executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable, robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding how carbon flows through the soil is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change. While soils have potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, the soil carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Scientists have developed mathematical process-based models of the soil carbon cycle based on existing knowledge, but they contain numerous unknown parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and often fit observations poorly. On the other hand, neural networks can learn patterns from data, but do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific relationships due to their black-box nature. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to ensure the encoder is fully interpretable and reveals relationships between input features and latent parameters; it uses novel smoothness penalties to balance expressivity and simplicity. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge. While the process-based decoder enforces established scientific knowledge, the KAN-based encoder reveals new scientific relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memorization in large language models poses critical risks for privacy and fairness as these systems scale to billions of parameters. While previous studies established correlations between memorization and factors like token frequency and repetition patterns, we revealed distinct response patterns: frequency increases minimally impact memorized samples (e.g. 0.09) while substantially affecting non-memorized samples (e.g., 0.25), with consistency observed across model scales. Through counterfactual analysis by perturbing sample prefixes and quantifying perturbation strength through token positional changes, we demonstrate that redundancy correlates with memorization patterns. Our findings establish that: about 79% of memorized samples are low-redundancy, these low-redundancy samples exhibit 2-fold higher vulnerability than high-redundancy ones, and consequently memorized samples drop by 0.6 under perturbation while non-memorized samples drop by only 0.01, indicating that more redundant content becomes both more memorable and more fragile. These findings suggest potential redundancy-guided approaches for data preprocessing, thereby reducing privacy risks and mitigating bias to ensure fairness in model deployments.

  Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential historythis http URLcan efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.

  Estimating rate coefficients from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence, which hinder effective rate coefficient estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a black-box neural ODE is trained to fit concentration trajectories; second, a Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) is pre-trained to learn the mapping between concentrations and their time derivatives; and third, the rate coefficients are fine-tuned by integrating with the pre-trained CRNN. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work addressing stiff neural ODE for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

  Vision is well-known for its use in manipulation, especially using visual servoing. Due to the 3D nature of the world, using multiple camera views and merging them creates better representations for Q-learning and in turn, trains more sample efficient policies. Nevertheless, these multi-view policies are sensitive to failing cameras and can be burdensome to deploy. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Merge And Disentanglement (MAD) algorithm that efficiently merges views to increase sample efficiency while simultaneously disentangling views by augmenting multi-view feature inputs with single-view features. This produces robust policies and allows lightweight deployment. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach using Meta-World and ManiSkill3.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling.

  Much of federated learning (FL) focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice due to distribution shifts, motivating the development of domain generalization (DG) approaches that leverage source domain data to train models capable of generalizing to unseen target domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the star-topology architecture. We develop Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing ($\textit{StyleDDG}$), a decentralized DG algorithm which allows devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we provide the first systematic approach to analyzing style-based DG training in decentralized networks. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\textit{StyleDDG}$. We then obtain analytical conditions under which convergence of $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can be guaranteed. Through experiments on popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal communication overhead compared to baseline decentralized gradient methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The demand for large language model inference is rapidly increasing. Pipeline parallelism offers a cost-effective deployment strategy for distributed inference but suffers from high service latency. While incorporating speculative decoding to pipeline parallelism improves performance, it still faces challenges of low hardware utilization and narrow speculative window. Inspired by branch prediction in instruction pipelining, we introduce SpecPipe, which fills the pipeline with speculative tokens of a request step-by-step. By maximizing the hardware utilization, SpecPipe decodes one token per pipeline step ideally. Specifically, SpecPipe comprises a dynamic speculative token tree and a pipelined inference framework. The tree dynamically accepts tokens from a speculative token source and outputs the tokens to the inference pipeline. Since the speculative window relaxed in our framework, a high-accuracy draft model is integrated without fine-tuning. The pipeline inference framework follows node-wise computation, pruning propagation, and inter-node communication stages. We implement SpecPipe and a variant SpecPipe-DB with dynamic batching for single- and multi-request inference, respectively. On an 8-stage pipeline, SpecPipe improves time between tokens on diverse single-request workloads by $4.19\times$-$5.53\times$ over standard pipeline parallelism and by $2.08\times$-$2.38\times$ over prior tree-based speculative decoding methods. For multi-request workloads, SpecPipe-DB achieves $1.64\times$-$2.08\times$ higher throughput and $1.61\times$-$2.06\times$ lower time between tokens than vLLM.

  With growing emphasis on privacy regulations, machine unlearning has become increasingly critical in real-world applications such as social networks and recommender systems, many of which are naturally represented as graphs. However, existing graph unlearning methods often modify nodes or edges indiscriminately, overlooking their impact on fairness. For instance, forgetting links between users of different genders may inadvertently exacerbate group disparities. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes both the graph structure and the model to achieve fair unlearning. Our method rewires the graph by removing redundant edges that hinder forgetting while preserving fairness through targeted edge augmentation. We further introduce a worst-case evaluation mechanism to assess robustness under challenging scenarios. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more effective and fair unlearning than existing baselines.

  To be helpful assistants, AI agents must be aware of their own capabilities and limitations. This includes knowing when to answer from parametric knowledge versus using tools, when to trust tool outputs, and when to abstain or hedge. Such capabilities are hard to teach through supervised fine-tuning because they require constructing examples that reflect the agent's specific capabilities. We therefore propose a radically new approach to teaching agents what they know: \emph{collaborative self-play}. We construct multi-agent collaborations in which the group is rewarded for collectively arriving at correct answers. The desired meta-knowledge emerges from the incentives built into the structure of the interaction. We focus on small societies of agents that have access to heterogeneous tools (corpus-specific retrieval), and therefore must collaborate to maximize their success while minimizing their effort. Experiments show that group-level rewards for multi-agent communities can induce policies that \emph{transfer} to improve tool use and selective prediction in settings where individual agents are deployed in isolation.

  A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mamba state-space models (SSMs) have recently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) in various tasks and been widely adapted. However, a major concern for stable learning in recurrent-based deep models (such as SSMs) is the sensitivity of their recurrent dynamics. Despite widespread adaptation, the sensitivity of Mamba's recurrent dynamics under common fine-tuning methods-e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-remains unexplored. Empirically, we show that Mamba LLMs are extremely stable to changes introduced by combinations of MPFT and PEFT, in stark contrast to Transformer LLMs, which we demonstrate may drastically diverge from their respective full-precision counterparts under different combinations of MPFT and PEFT (despite the near-ubiquitous adaptation of these fine-tuning frameworks for attention-based models). The demonstrated robustness of Mamba LLMs are due to their recurrent dynamics, which we prove are guaranteed to be stable using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov stability). We conclude by using MPFT and PEFT to novelly study Mamba LLMs' in-context learning (ICL) abilities on natural language tasks, thus supplementing other recent work.

  Neural networks surround us, in the form of large language models, speech transcription systems, molecular discovery algorithms, robotics, and much more. Stripped of anything else, neural networks are compositions of differentiable primitives, and studying them means learning how to program and how to interact with these models, a particular example of what is called differentiable programming.This primer is an introduction to this fascinating field imagined for someone, like Alice, who has just ventured into this strange differentiable wonderland. I overview the basics of optimizing a function via automatic differentiation, and a selection of the most common designs for handling sequences, graphs, texts, and audios. The focus is on a intuitive, self-contained introduction to the most important design techniques, including convolutional, attentional, and recurrent blocks, hoping to bridge the gap between theory and code (PyTorch and JAX) and leaving the reader capable of understanding some of the most advanced models out there, such as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal architectures.

  _Prashansa Panda, Shalabh Bhatnagar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Several recent works have focused on carrying out non-asymptotic convergence analyses for AC algorithms. Recently, a two-timescale critic-actor algorithm has been presented for the discounted cost setting in the look-up table case where the timescales of the actor and the critic are reversed and only asymptotic convergence shown. In our work, we present the first two-timescale critic-actor algorithm with function approximation in the long-run average reward setting and present the first finite-time non-asymptotic as well as asymptotic convergence analysis for such a scheme. We obtain optimal learning rates and prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of {$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-(2+\delta)})$ with $\delta >0$ arbitrarily close to zero,} for the mean squared error of the critic to be upper bounded by $\epsilon$ which is better than the one obtained for two-timescale AC in a similar setting. A notable feature of our analysis is that we present the asymptotic convergence analysis of our scheme in addition to the finite-time bounds that we obtain and show the almost sure asymptotic convergence of the (slower) critic recursion to the attractor of an associated differential inclusion with actor parameters corresponding to local maxima of a perturbed average reward objective. We also show the results of numerical experiments on three benchmark settings and observe that our critic-actor algorithm performs the best amongst all algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Actor Critic methods have found immense applications on a wide range of Reinforcement Learning tasks especially when the state-action space is large. In this paper, we consider actor critic and natural actor critic algorithms with function approximation for constrained Markov decision processes (C-MDP) involving inequality constraints and carry out a non-asymptotic analysis for both of these algorithms in a non-i.i.d (Markovian) setting. We consider the long-run average cost criterion where both the objective and the constraint functions are suitable policy-dependent long-run averages of certain prescribed cost functions. We handle the inequality constraints using the Lagrange multiplier method. We prove that these algorithms are guaranteed to find a first-order stationary point (i.e., $\Vert \nabla L(\theta,\gamma)\Vert_2^2 \leq \epsilon$) of the performance (Lagrange) function $L(\theta,\gamma)$, with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ in the case of both Constrained Actor Critic (C-AC) and Constrained Natural Actor Critic (C-NAC) algorithms. We also show the results of experiments on three different Safety-Gym environments.

  _Marco Saponara, Elias Fernandez Domingos, Jorge M. Pacheco, Tom Lenaerts_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Empirical evidence shows that human behaviour often deviates from game-theoretical rationality. For instance, humans may hold unrealistic expectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases remain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive biases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a population deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies to anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the Incremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a systematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while negatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that selection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational behaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as the reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly, positively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing to a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased reasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning strategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful thinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that certain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute an adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas.

  _Xinxing Ren, Caelum Forder, Qianbo Zang, Ahsen Tahir, Roman J. Georgio, Suman Deb, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Multi-Agent Path Finding in Continuous Time (\mapfr) extends the classical MAPF problem by allowing agents to operate in continuous time. Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CCBS) is a foundational algorithm for solving \mapfr optimally. In this paper, we revisit the theoretical claims of CCBS and show the algorithm is incomplete, due to an uncountably infinite state space created by continuous wait durations. Through theoretical analysis and counter-examples, we examine the inherent challenges of extending existing MAPF solvers to address \mapfr while preserving optimality guarantees. By restricting waiting duration to fixed amounts, we identify a related sub-problem on graphs, \mapfrdt which we show is optimally solvable, including by CCBS. It remains an open question whether similar models exist for \mapfrct, a generalised version of \mapfrdt that allows arbitrary wait times, and \mapfrcs, which further allows arbitrary movements in continuous space.

  _Olger Siebinga, David Abbink_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly) deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding, a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction (CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However, it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and encourage further exploration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments, making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances. There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight. Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work, we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN) trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued, high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive. This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore, MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation tasks.

  Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph, discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers of Hanoi environments, and a distinct Automated Forklift domain with two environments. The results demonstrate high data efficiency with as few as five skill demonstrations, strong zero- and few-shot generalizations, and interpretable decision making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or robot actions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error, optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

  Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints, ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e., robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and (2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.

  Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety, efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity, prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated promising results when compared with RNNs.

  Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different (out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

  In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$ computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac, an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities. Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$), material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise robotic manipulation.

  _TianChen Huang, Wei Gao, Runchen Xu, Shiwu Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse, safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual (Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact, forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence, and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) allows agents to autonomously learn diverse behaviors without task-specific rewards. While recent USD methods have shown promise, their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in the safety, interpretability, and deployability of the learned skills. Our approach employs user-defined factorization of the state space to learn disentangled skill representations. It assigns different skill discovery algorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To encourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based inductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style factor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We evaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate zero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show that factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured human-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance safety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can be used for downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with hand-crafted rewards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely available and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments. Yet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a global localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the robot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap (OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a navigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic observation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected signs to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte Carlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part of a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental results show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one to two signs.

  _Yinuo Wang, Gavin Tao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance, efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability. Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic, velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm. The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Path planning for autonomous robots presents a fundamental trade-off between optimality and safety. While conventional algorithms typically prioritize one of these objectives, we introduce the Unified Path Planner (UPP), a unified framework that simultaneously addresses both. UPP is a graph-search-based algorithm that employs a modified heuristic function incorporating a dynamic safety cost, enabling an adaptive balance between path length and obstacle clearance. We establish theoretical sub-optimality bounds for the planner and demonstrate that its safety-to-optimality ratio can be tuned via adjustable parameters, with a trade-off in computational complexity. Extensive simulations show that UPP achieves a high success rate, generating near-optimal paths with only a negligible increase in cost over traditional A*, while ensuring safety margins that closely approach those of the classical Voronoi planner. Finally, the practical efficacy of UPP is validated through a hardware implementation on a TurtleBot, confirming its ability to navigate cluttered environments by generating safe, sub-optimal paths.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clear communication of robot intent fosters transparency and interpretability in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), particularly during assistive tasks involving direct human-robot contact. We introduce CoRI, a pipeline that automatically generates natural language communication of a robot's upcoming actions directly from its motion plan and visual perception. Our pipeline first processes the robot's image view to identify human poses and key environmental features. It then encodes the planned 3D spatial trajectory (including velocity and force) onto this view, visually grounding the path and its dynamics. CoRI queries a vision-language model with this visual representation to interpret the planned action within the visual context before generating concise, user-directed statements, without relying on task-specific information. Results from a user study involving robot-assisted feeding, bathing, and shaving tasks across two different robots indicate that CoRI leads to statistically significant difference in communication clarity compared to a baseline communication strategy. Specifically, CoRI effectively conveys not only the robot's high-level intentions but also crucial details about its motion and any collaborative user action needed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL)-based motion imitation methods trained on demonstration data can effectively learn natural and expressive motions with minimal reward engineering but often struggle to generalize to novel environments. We address this by proposing a hierarchical RL framework in which a low-level policy is first pre-trained to imitate animal motions on flat ground, thereby establishing motion priors. A subsequent high-level, goal-conditioned policy then builds on these priors, learning residual corrections that enable perceptive locomotion, local obstacle avoidance, and goal-directed navigation across diverse and rugged terrains. Simulation experiments illustrate the effectiveness of learned residuals in adapting to progressively challenging uneven terrains while still preserving the locomotion characteristics provided by the motion priors. Furthermore, our results demonstrate improvements in motion regularization over baseline models trained without motion priors under similar reward setups. Real-world experiments with an ANYmal-D quadruped robot confirm our policy's capability to generalize animal-like locomotion skills to complex terrains, demonstrating smooth and efficient locomotion and local navigation performance amidst challenging terrains with obstacles.

  Cross-embodiment generalization underpins the vision of building generalist embodied agents for any robot, yet its enabling factors remain poorly understood. We investigate embodiment scaling laws, the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, using robot locomotion as a test bed. We procedurally generate ~1,000 embodiments with topological, geometric, and joint-level kinematic variations, and train policies on random subsets. We observe positive scaling trends supporting the hypothesis, and find that embodiment scaling enables substantially broader generalization than data scaling on fixed embodiments. Our best policy, trained on the full dataset, transfers zero-shot to novel embodiments in simulation and the real world, including the Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, morphology co-design, and beyond.

  How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.

  We present the Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a trajectory-level latent-variable policy for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation (e.g., box catching) that formulates planning as inference in a low-dimensional latent space and is learned effectively from human demonstration videos. During execution, LAP achieves real-time adaptation by maintaining a posterior over the latent plan and performing variational replanning as new observations arrive. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, we introduce a model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Through challenging box catching experiments with varying object properties, LAP demonstrates superior success rates, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency by learning human-like compliant motions and adaptive behaviors. Overall, LAP enables dynamic manipulation with real-time adaptation and successfully transfer across heterogeneous robot platforms using the same human demonstration videos.

  Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a promising solution for handling the complexity of fabricating soft robots. However, the AM of hyperelastic materials is still challenging with a limited material range. Within this work, pellet-based 3D printing of very soft thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) was explored (down to Shore Hardness 00-30). Our results show that TPEs can have similar engineering stress and maximum elongation as Ecoflex OO-10. In addition, we 3D-printed airtight thin membranes (0.2-1.2 mm), which could inflate up to a stretch of 1320%. Combining the membrane's large expansion and softness with the 3D printing of hollow structures simplified the design of a bending actuator that can bend 180 degrees and reach a blocked force of 238 times its weight. In addition, by 3D printing TPE pellets and rigid filaments, the soft membrane could grasp objects by enveloping an object or as a sensorized sucker, which relied on the TPE's softness to conform to the object or act as a seal. In addition, the membrane of the sucker acted as a tactile sensor to detect an object before adhesion. These results suggest the feasibility of AM of soft robots using soft TPEs and membranes as a promising class of materials and sensorized actuators, respectively.

  Object manipulation in robotics faces challenges due to diverse object shapes, sizes, and fragility. Gripper-based methods offer precision and low degrees of freedom (DOF) but the gripper limits the kind of objects to grasp. On the other hand, surface-based approaches provide flexibility for handling fragile and heterogeneous objects but require numerous actuators, increasing complexity. We propose new manipulation hardware that utilizes equally spaced linear actuators placed vertically and connected by a soft surface. In this setup, object manipulation occurs on the soft surface through coordinated movements of the surrounding actuators. This approach requires fewer actuators to cover a large manipulation area, offering a cost-effective solution with a lower DOF compared to dense actuator arrays. It also effectively handles heterogeneous objects of varying shapes and weights, even when they are significantly smaller than the distance between actuators. This method is particularly suitable for managing highly fragile objects in the food industry.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In swarm robotics, decentralized control is often proposed as a more scalable and fault-tolerant alternative to centralized control. However, centralized behaviors are often faster and more efficient than their decentralized counterparts. In any given application, the goals and constraints of the task being solved should guide the choice to use centralized control, decentralized control, or a combination of the two. Currently, the exact trade-offs that exist between centralization and decentralization are not well defined. In this paper, we compare the performance of centralization and decentralization in the example task of sweep coverage, across five different types of multi-robot control structures: random walk, decentralized with beacons, hybrid formation control using self-organizing hierarchy, centralized formation control, and predetermined. In all five approaches, the coverage task is completed by a group of ground robots. In each approach, except for the random walk, the ground robots are assisted by UAVs, acting as supervisors or beacons. We compare the approaches in terms of three performance metrics for which centralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- coverage completeness, coverage uniformity, and sweep completion time -- and two metrics for which decentralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- scalability (4, 8, or 16 ground robots) and fault tolerance (0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% ground robot failure).
