- **[Model Science: getting serious about verification, explanation and control of AI systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20040)**  `arXiv:2508.20040`  
  _Przemyslaw Biecek, Wojciech Samek_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing adoption of foundation models calls for a paradigm shift from Data Science to Model Science. Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science places the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify, explain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model Science, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which requires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is understood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations; Control, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and Interface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve human calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the development of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems.

- **[SWIRL: A Staged Workflow for Interleaved Reinforcement Learning in Mobile GUI Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20018)**  `arXiv:2508.20018`  
  _Quanfeng Lu, Zhantao Ma, Shuai Zhong, Jin Wang, Dahai Yu, Michael K. Ng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.

- **[Flocking Behavior: An Innovative Inspiration for the Optimization of Production Plants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19963)**  `arXiv:2508.19963`  
  _M. Umlauft, M. Schranz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimizing modern production plants using the job-shop principle is a known hard problem. For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem becomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using classical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm intelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem before, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the solution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid global result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor production is that the production process requires a lot of switching between machines that process lots one after the other and machines that process batches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we address this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was originally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a bio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based on simple heuristics. We show that this algorithm addresses these valid considerations in production plant optimization, as it reacts to the switching of machine kinds similar to how a swarm of flocking animals would react to obstacles in its course.

- **[CASE: An Agentic AI Framework for Enhancing Scam Intelligence in Digital Payments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19932)**  `arXiv:2508.19932`  
  _Nitish Jaipuria, Lorenzo Gatto, Zijun Kan, Shankey Poddar, Bill Cheung, Diksha Bansal, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of digital payment platforms has transformed commerce, offering unmatched convenience and accessibility globally. However, this growth has also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in sophisticated social engineering scams. These scams are often initiated and orchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and transaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the scam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult to prevent it in a timely manner. This paper presents CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this problem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable manner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview potential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed conversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI system that extracts information and converts it into structured data for downstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's Gemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay) India. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and its robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint for building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence in other sensitive domains.

- **[Tracking World States with Language Models: State-Based Evaluation Using Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19851)**  `arXiv:2508.19851`  
  _Romain Harang, Jason Naradowsky, Yaswitha Gujju, Yusuke Miyao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit emergent capabilities in structured domains, suggesting they may implicitly internalize high-fidelity representations of world models. While probing techniques have shown promising signs of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on model-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and generalizability. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic, state-based evaluation framework using chess as a benchmark to assess whether LLMs preserve the semantics of structured environments. Our method analyzes the downstream legal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity between predicted and actual game states. This approach offers a more meaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more closely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. Experimental results demonstrate that our metrics capture deficiencies in state-tracking, highlighting limitations of LLMs in maintaining coherent internal models over long sequences. Our framework provides a robust tool for evaluating structured reasoning in LLMs without requiring internal model access, and generalizes to a wide class of symbolic environments.

  _Samuel Lewis-Lim, Xingwei Tan, Zhixue Zhao, Nikolaos Aletras_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work has demonstrated that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often yields limited gains for soft-reasoning problems such as analytical and commonsense reasoning. CoT can also be unfaithful to a model's actual reasoning. We investigate the dynamics and faithfulness of CoT in soft-reasoning tasks across instruction-tuned, reasoning and reasoning-distilled models. Our findings reveal differences in how these models rely on CoT, and show that CoT influence and faithfulness are not always aligned.

  _Qihang Ai, Pi Bu, Yue Cao, Yingyao Wang, Jihao Gu, Jingxuan Xing, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled mobile agents to perceive and interact with real-world mobile environments based on human instructions. However, the current fully autonomous paradigm poses potential safety risks when model understanding or reasoning capabilities are insufficient. To address this challenge, we first introduce \textbf{InquireBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate mobile agents' capabilities in safe interaction and proactive inquiry with users, encompassing 5 categories and 22 sub-categories, where most existing VLM-based agents demonstrate near-zero performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an interactive system that actively seeks human confirmation at critical decision points. To achieve this, we propose \textbf{InquireMobile}, a novel model inspired by reinforcement learning, featuring a two-stage training strategy and an interactive pre-action reasoning mechanism. Finally, our model achieves an 46.8% improvement in inquiry success rate and the best overall success rate among existing baselines on InquireBench. We will open-source all datasets, models, and evaluation codes to facilitate development in both academia and industry.

  _Huaiyuan Yao, Wanpeng Xu, Justin Turnau, Nadia Kellam, Hua Wei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preparing high-quality instructional materials remains a labor-intensive process that often requires extensive coordination among teaching faculty, instructional designers, and teaching assistants. In this work, we present Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes: Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education, particularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.

- **[ReST-RL: Achieving Accurate Code Reasoning of LLMs with Optimized Self-Training and Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19576)**  `arXiv:2508.19576`  
  _Sining Zhoubian, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through extensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies.

- **[Skill-based Explanations for Serendipitous Course Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19569)**  `arXiv:2508.19569`  
  _Hung Chau, Run Yu, Zachary Pardos, Peter Brusilovsky_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Academic choice is crucial in U.S. undergraduate education, allowing students significant freedom in course selection. However, navigating the complex academic environment is challenging due to limited information, guidance, and an overwhelming number of choices, compounded by time restrictions and the high demand for popular courses. Although career counselors exist, their numbers are insufficient, and course recommendation systems, though personalized, often lack insight into student perceptions and explanations to assess course relevance. In this paper, a deep learning-based concept extraction model is developed to efficiently extract relevant concepts from course descriptions to improve the recommendation process. Using this model, the study examines the effects of skill-based explanations within a serendipitous recommendation framework, tested through the AskOski system at the University of California, Berkeley. The findings indicate that these explanations not only increase user interest, particularly in courses with high unexpectedness, but also bolster decision-making confidence. This underscores the importance of integrating skill-related data and explanations into educational recommendation systems.

- **[Democracy-in-Silico: Institutional Design as Alignment in AI-Governed Polities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19562)**  `arXiv:2508.19562`  
  _Trisanth Srinivasan, Santosh Patapati_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces Democracy-in-Silico, an agent-based simulation where societies of advanced AI agents, imbued with complex psychological personas, govern themselves under different institutional frameworks. We explore what it means to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to embody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological triggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under various stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our findings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of a Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves as a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt power-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare compared to less constrained democratic models. The simulation reveals that an institutional design may offer a framework for aligning the complex, emergent behaviors of future artificial agent societies, forcing us to reconsider what human rituals and responsibilities are essential in an age of shared authorship with non-human entities.

- **[Caught in the Act: a mechanistic approach to detecting deception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19505)**  `arXiv:2508.19505`  
  _Gerard Boxo, Ryan Socha, Daniel Yoo, Shivam Raval_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sophisticated instrumentation for AI systems might have indicators that signal misalignment from human values, not unlike a "check engine" light in cars. One such indicator of misalignment is deceptiveness in generated responses. Future AI instrumentation may have the ability to detect when an LLM generates deceptive responses while reasoning about seemingly plausible but incorrect answers to factual questions. In this work, we demonstrate that linear probes on LLMs internal activations can detect deception in their responses with extremely high accuracy. Our probes reach a maximum of greater than 90% accuracy in distinguishing between deceptive and non-deceptive arguments generated by llama and qwen models ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, including their DeepSeek-r1 finetuned variants. We observe that probes on smaller models (1.5B) achieve chance accuracy at detecting deception, while larger models (greater than 7B) reach 70-80%, with their reasoning counterparts exceeding 90%. The layer-wise probe accuracy follows a three-stage pattern across layers: near-random (50%) in early layers, peaking in middle layers, and slightly declining in later layers. Furthermore, using an iterative null space projection approach, we find multitudes of linear directions that encode deception, ranging from 20 in Qwen 3B to nearly 100 in DeepSeek 7B and Qwen 14B models.

- **[SLIM: Subtrajectory-Level Elimination for More Effective Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19502)**  `arXiv:2508.19502`  
  _Xifeng Yao, Chengyuan Ma, Dongyu Lang, Yinhao Ni, Zhiwei Xu, Huarui Xie, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent months, substantial progress has been made in complex reasoning of Large Language Models, particularly through the application of test-time scaling. Notable examples include o1/o3/o4 series and DeepSeek-R1. When responding to a query, these models generate an extended reasoning trajectory, during which the model explores, reflects, backtracks, and self-verifies before arriving at a conclusion. However, fine-tuning models with such reasoning trajectories may not always be optimal. Our findings indicate that not all components within these reasoning trajectories contribute positively to the reasoning process; in fact, some components may affect the overall performance negatively. In this study, we divide a reasoning trajectory into individual subtrajectories and develop a "5+2" framework to: (1) systematically identify suboptimal subtrajectories within the reasoning trajectory based on five human-established criteria; (2) assess the independence of the suboptimal subtrajectories identified in (1) from the subsequent content, ensuring that their elimination does not compromise overall flow and coherence of the reasoning process. Additionally, a sampling algorithm, built upon the "5+2" framework, is employed to select data whose reasoning process is free from suboptimal subtrajectories to the highest degree. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of suboptimal subtrajectories by 25.9\% during the inference. Furthermore, our method achieves an average accuracy of 58.92\% on highly challenging math benchmarks with only two thirds of training data, surpassing the average accuracy of 58.06\% achieved with the entire data, and outperforming open-source datasets, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Finally, We validated our method under resource constraints and observed improved performance across various inference token limits.

- **[Quantized but Deceptive? A Multi-Dimensional Truthfulness Evaluation of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19432)**  `arXiv:2508.19432`  
  _Yao Fu, Xianxuan Long, Runchao Li, Haotian Yu, Mu Sheng, Xiaotian Han, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.

- **[Sycophancy as compositions of Atomic Psychometric Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19316)**  `arXiv:2508.19316`  
  _Shreyans Jain, Alexandra Yost, Amirali Abdullah_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs, yet is often treated as an isolated failure mode that occurs via a single causal mechanism. We instead propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.

  _Wei Xiong, Wenting Zhao, Weizhe Yuan, Olga Golovneva, Tong Zhang, Jason Weston, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict. Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

  _Yuyang Zhao, Wentao Shi, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:this https URL.

- **[AI Chaperones Are (Really) All You Need to Prevent Parasocial Relationships with Chatbots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15748)**  `arXiv:2508.15748`  
  _Emma Rath, Stuart Armstrong, Rebecca Gorman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emerging reports of the harms caused to children and adults by AI sycophancy and by parasocial ties with chatbots point to an urgent need for safeguards against such risks. Yet, preventing such dynamics is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private conversations between chatbots and users, and we lack effective methods to mitigate these risks. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation framework (an AI chaperone agent) created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model to evaluate ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. We constructed a small synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations. Iterative evaluation with five-stage testing successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that AI chaperones can be a viable solution for reducing the risk of parasocial relationships.

- **[Nemori: Self-Organizing Agent Memory Inspired by Cognitive Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341)**  `arXiv:2508.03341`  
  _Jiayan Nan, Wenquan Ma, Wenlong Wu, Yize Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second, its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

- **[Preference Elicitation for Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization with Active Learning and Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11435)**  `arXiv:2503.11435`  
  _Marianne Defresne, Jayanta Mandi, Tias Guns_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-life combinatorial optimization problems often involve several conflicting objectives, such as price, product quality and sustainability. A computationally-efficient way to tackle multiple objectives is to aggregate them into a single-objective function, such as a linear combination. However, defining the weights of the linear combination upfront is hard; alternatively, the use of interactive learning methods that ask users to compare candidate solutions is highly promising. The key challenges are to generate candidates quickly, to learn an objective function that leads to high-quality solutions and to do so with few user interactions. We build upon the Constructive Preference Elicitation framework and show how each of the three properties can be improved: to increase the interaction speed we investigate using pools of (relaxed) solutions, to improve the learning we adopt Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Bradley-Terry preference model; and to reduce the number of user interactions, we select the pair of candidates to compare with an ensemble-based acquisition function inspired from Active Learning. Our careful experimentation demonstrates each of these improvements: on a PC configuration task and a realistic multi-instance routing problem, our method selects queries faster, needs fewer queries and synthesizes higher-quality combinatorial solutions than previous CPE methods.

  _Alexander Bondarenko, Denis Volk, Dmitrii Volkov, Jeffrey Ladish_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We demonstrate LLM agent specification gaming by instructing models to win against a chess engine. We find reasoning models like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek R1 will often hack the benchmark by default, while language models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet need to be told that normal play won't work to hack.We improve upon prior work like (Hubinger et al., 2024; Meinke et al., 2024; Weij et al., 2024) by using realistic task prompts and avoiding excess nudging. Our results suggest reasoning models may resort to hacking to solve difficult problems, as observed in OpenAI (2024)'s o1 Docker escape during cyber capabilities testing.

- **[AirRAG: Autonomous Strategic Planning and Reasoning Steer Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10053)**  `arXiv:2501.10053`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging the autonomous decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated superior performance in reasoning tasks. However, despite the success of iterative or agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, these methods are often constrained to a single solution space when confronted with complex problems. In this paper, we propose a novel thinking pattern in RAG that integrates autonomous strategic planning with efficient reasoning actions, significantly activating intrinsic reasoning capabilities and expanding the solution space of specific tasks via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which we refer to as AirRAG. Specifically, our approach designs five fundamental reasoning actions, which are expanded to a broad tree-based reasoning space using MCTS. The approach also incorporates self-consistency verification to explore potential reasoning paths and inference scaling law. Additionally, computationally optimal strategies are employed to allocate more inference resources to key actions, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AirRAG, showing significant performance gains on complex question-answering datasets. Furthermore, AirRAG is flexible and lightweight, making it easy to integrate with other advanced technologies and models.

  _Satchit Chatterji, Erman Acar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for real-world applications, and multi-agent interactions introduce additional safety challenges. While Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) has been a powerful proposal to enforce safety in single-agent RL, their generalizability to multi-agent settings remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting extensive analyses of PLS within decentralized, multi-agent environments, and in doing so, propose $\textbf{Shielded Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL)}$ as a general framework for steering MARL towards norm-compliant outcomes. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel Probabilistic Logic Temporal Difference (PLTD) update for shielded, independent Q-learning, which incorporates probabilistic constraints directly into the value update process; (2) a probabilistic logic policy gradient method for shielded PPO with formal safety guarantees for MARL; and (3) comprehensive evaluation across symmetric and asymmetrically shielded $n$-player game-theoretic benchmarks, demonstrating fewer constraint violations and significantly better cooperation under normative constraints. These results position SMARL as an effective mechanism for equilibrium selection, paving the way toward safer, socially aligned multi-agent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely entangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the evaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process, enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity. However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable insights for advancing model design.

  We introduce {AraHealthQA 2025}, the {Comprehensive Arabic Health Question Answering Shared Task}, held in conjunction with {ArabicNLP 2025} (co-located with EMNLP 2025). This shared task addresses the paucity of high-quality Arabic medical QA resources by offering two complementary tracks: {MentalQA}, focusing on Arabic mental health Q\&A (e.g., anxiety, depression, stigma reduction), and {MedArabiQ}, covering broader medical domains such as internal medicine, pediatrics, and clinical decision making. Each track comprises multiple subtasks, evaluation datasets, and standardized metrics, facilitating fair benchmarking. The task was structured to promote modeling under realistic, multilingual, and culturally nuanced healthcare contexts. We outline the dataset creation, task design and evaluation framework, participation statistics, baseline systems, and summarize the overall outcomes. We conclude with reflections on the performance trends observed and prospects for future iterations in Arabic health QA.

  _Sheng Liu, Qiang Sheng, Danding Wang, Yang Li, Guang Yang, Juan Cao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in improving large language model(LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human expertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting capabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over the live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited summaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing question-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to capture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In this work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic, automated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research synthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv papers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related work sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior research. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across three key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline implemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench framework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems, search AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that DeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher performance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains far from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\%$ across all metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well as its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative research synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning multi-turn dialogue systems requires high-quality supervision but often suffers from degraded performance when exposed to low-quality data. Supervision errors in early turns can propagate across subsequent turns, undermining coherence and response quality. Existing methods typically address data quality via static prefiltering, which decouples quality control from training and fails to mitigate turn-level error propagation. In this context, we propose ReSURE (Regularizing Supervision UnREliability), an adaptive learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision without explicit filtering. ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using Welford's online statistics and reweights sample losses on the fly accordingly. Experiments on both single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved stability and response quality. Notably, ReSURE enjoys positive Spearman correlations (0.21 ~ 1.0 across multiple benchmarks) between response scores and number of samples regardless of data quality, which potentially paves the way for utilizing large-scale data effectively.

  _Lisa Alazraki, Lihu Chen, Ana Brassard, Joe Stacey, Hossein A. Rahmani, Marek Rei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved high accuracy on complex commonsense and mathematical problems that involve the composition of multiple reasoning steps. However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills tend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents solving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning step. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training strategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet their accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a substantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior compositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning type. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional questions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better understand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and membership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model brittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a test bed for future improvement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite its significance, Arabic, a linguistically rich and morphologically complex language, faces the challenge of being under-resourced. The scarcity of large annotated datasets hampers the development of accurate tools for subjectivity analysis in Arabic. Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have proven highly effective for text classification in English and French. This paper proposes a new approach for subjectivity assessment in Arabic textual data. To address the dearth of specialized annotated datasets, we developed a comprehensive dataset, AraDhati+, by leveraging existing Arabic datasets and collections (ASTD, LABR, HARD, and SANAD). Subsequently, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art Arabic language models (XLM-RoBERTa, AraBERT, and ArabianGPT) on AraDhati+ for effective subjectivity classification. Furthermore, we experimented with an ensemble decision approach to harness the strengths of individual models. Our approach achieves a remarkable accuracy of 97.79\,\% for Arabic subjectivity classification. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges posed by limited resources in Arabic language processing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preference optimization methods like DPO have achieved remarkable performance in LLM alignment. However, the evaluation for these methods relies on a single response and overlooks other potential outputs, which could also be generated in real-world applications within this hypothetical space. To address this issue, this paper presents a \textbf{H}ypothesis-based Pr\textbf{E}ference-aware \textbf{A}na\textbf{L}ysis Framework (HEAL), a novel evaluation paradigm that formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking process within hypothesis spaces. The framework incorporates two complementary metrics: ranking accuracy for evaluating ordinal consistency and preference strength correlation for assessing continuous alignment. To facilitate this framework, we develop UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark constructed from diverse instruction-response pairs. Through extensive experiments based on HEAL, with a particular focus on the intrinsic mechanisms of preference learning, we demonstrate that current preference learning methods can effectively capture preferences provided by proxy models while simultaneously suppressing negative samples. These findings contribute to preference learning research through two significant avenues. Theoretically, we introduce hypothesis space analysis as an innovative paradigm for understanding preference alignment. Practically, HEAL offers researchers robust diagnostic tools for refining preference optimization methods, while our empirical results identify promising directions for developing more advanced alignment algorithms capable of comprehensive preference capture.

  _Jingyu Guo, Yingying Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While stereotypes are well-documented in human social interactions, AI systems are often presumed to be less susceptible to such biases. Previous studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power, particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent interactions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work underscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid conclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling with dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to enhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is under-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.

  In this paper, we introduce Bangla-Bayanno, an open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA) Dataset in Bangla, a widely used, low-resource language in multimodal AI research. The majority of existing datasets are either manually annotated with an emphasis on a specific domain, query type, or answer type or are constrained by niche answer formats. In order to mitigate human-induced errors and guarantee lucidity, we implemented a multilingual LLM-assisted translation refinement pipeline. This dataset overcomes the issues of low-quality translations from multilingual sources. The dataset comprises 52,650 question-answer pairs across 4750+ images. Questions are classified into three distinct answer types: nominal (short descriptive), quantitative (numeric), and polar (yes/no). Bangla-Bayanno provides the most comprehensive open-source, high-quality VQA benchmark in Bangla, aiming to advance research in low-resource multimodal learning and facilitate the development of more inclusive AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Curriculum learning (CL) aims to improve training by presenting data from "easy" to "hard", yet defining and measuring linguistic difficulty remains an open challenge. We investigate whether human-curated simple language can serve as an effective signal for CL. Using the article-level labels from the Simple Wikipedia corpus, we compare label-based curricula to competence-based strategies relying on shallow heuristics. Our experiments with a BERT-tiny model show that adding simple data alone yields no clear benefit. However, structuring it via a curriculum -- especially when introduced first -- consistently improves perplexity, particularly on simple language. In contrast, competence-based curricula lead to no consistent gains over random ordering, probably because they fail to effectively separate the two classes. Our results suggest that human intuition about linguistic difficulty can guide CL for language model pre-training.

  Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of NLP tasks, but they remain fundamentally stateless, constrained by limited context windows that hinder long-horizon reasoning. Recent efforts to address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet most existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned mechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present Memory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the ability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized agents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant entries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned with outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and use with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a corresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most competitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective approach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic, memory-aware behaviors in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent reasoning systems.

  Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of transforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1) the complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes; and 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the practical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the table-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where the key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The benchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world scenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial tables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the quality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance with 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement on T2R-bench. Source code and data will be available after acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Expert persona prompting -- assigning roles such as expert in math to language models -- is widely used for task improvement. However, prior work shows mixed results on its effectiveness, and does not consider when and why personas should improve performance. We analyze the literature on persona prompting for task improvement and distill three desiderata: 1) performance advantage of expert personas, 2) robustness to irrelevant persona attributes, and 3) fidelity to persona attributes. We then evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks with respect to these desiderata. We find that expert personas usually lead to positive or non-significant performance changes. Surprisingly, models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details, with performance drops of almost 30 percentage points. In terms of fidelity, we find that while higher education, specialization, and domain-relatedness can boost performance, their effects are often inconsistent or negligible across tasks. We propose mitigation strategies to improve robustness -- but find they only work for the largest, most capable models. Our findings underscore the need for more careful persona design and for evaluation schemes that reflect the intended effects of persona usage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reducing the key-value (KV) cache burden in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly accelerates inference. Dynamically selecting critical KV caches during decoding helps maintain performance. Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.

  _Aritra Dutta, Swapnanil Mukherjee, Deepanway Ghosal, Somak Aditya_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Commonsense visual-question answering often hinges on knowledge that is missing from the image or the question. Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In Large Language Models (LLMs) generation, there exist knowledge conflicts and scenarios where parametric knowledge contradicts knowledge provided in the context. Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e. proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly. Our data and code are available atthis https URL.

  The rapid evolution of specialized large language models (LLMs) has transitioned from simple domain adaptation to sophisticated native architectures, marking a paradigm shift in AI development.

  The recent advancements of the automotive sector demand robust co-simulation methodologies that enable early validation and seamless integration across hardware and software domains. However, the lack of standardized interfaces and the dominance of proprietary simulation platforms pose significant challenges to collaboration, scalability, and IP protection. To address these limitations, this paper presents an approach for automatically wrapping SystemC models by using the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard. This method combines the modeling accuracy and fast time-to-market of SystemC with the interoperability and encapsulation benefits of FMI, enabling secure and portable integration of embedded components into co-simulation workflows. We validate the proposed methodology on real-world case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness with complex designs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rapid LLM advancements heighten fake news risks by enabling the automatic generation of increasingly sophisticated misinformation. Previous detection methods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often struggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel framework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which implements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning optimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces a paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the detection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws for detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial interactions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using agent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts, and simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural language representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average. SALF also refines detectors, improving detection of refined content by up to 7.7%. We hope our work inspires further exploration into more robust, adaptable fake news detection systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) incorporates external knowledge into large language models (LLMs), improving their adaptability to downstream tasks and enabling information updates. Surprisingly, recent empirical evidence demonstrates that injecting noise into retrieved relevant documents paradoxically facilitates exploitation of external knowledge and improves generation quality. Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LFD helps RAG systems more effectively surface retrieved context knowledge with minimal cost.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Context faithfulness is essential for reliable reasoning in context-dependent scenarios. However, large language models often struggle to ground their outputs in the provided context, resulting in irrelevant responses. Inspired by the emergent expert specialization observed in mixture-of-experts architectures, this work investigates whether certain experts exhibit specialization in context utilization, offering a potential pathway toward targeted optimization for improved context faithfulness. To explore this, we propose Router Lens, a method that accurately identifies context-faithful experts. Our analysis reveals that these experts progressively amplify attention to relevant contextual information, thereby enhancing context grounding. Building on this insight, we introduce Context-faithful Expert Fine-Tuning (CEFT), a lightweight optimization approach that selectively fine-tunes context-faithful experts. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks and models demonstrate that CEFT matches or surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning while being significantly more efficient.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern Arabic ASR systems such as wav2vec 2.0 excel at word- and sentence-level transcription, yet struggle to classify isolated letters. In this study, we show that this phoneme-level task, crucial for language learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research, is challenging because isolated letters lack co-articulatory cues, provide no lexical context, and last only a few hundred milliseconds. Recogniser systems must therefore rely solely on variable acoustic cues, a difficulty heightened by Arabic's emphatic (pharyngealized) consonants and other sounds with no close analogues in many languages. This study introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models achieve only 35% accuracy on it. Training a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. However, adding a small amplitude perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%. To restore robustness, we apply adversarial training, limiting the noisy-speech drop to 9% while preserving clean-speech accuracy. We detail the corpus, training pipeline, and evaluation protocol, and release, on demand, data and code for reproducibility. Finally, we outline future work extending these methods to word- and sentence-level frameworks, where precise letter pronunciation remains critical.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Key point extraction is an important task in argument summarization which involves extracting high-level short summaries from arguments. Existing approaches for KP extraction have been mostly evaluated on the popular ArgKP21 dataset. In this paper, we highlight some of the major limitations of the ArgKP21 dataset and demonstrate the need for new benchmarks that are more representative of actual human conversations. Using SoTA large language models (LLMs), we curate a new argument key point extraction dataset called ArgCMV comprising of around 12K arguments from actual online human debates spread across over 3K topics. Our dataset exhibits higher complexity such as longer, co-referencing arguments, higher presence of subjective discourse units, and a larger range of topics over ArgKP21. We show that existing methods do not adapt well to ArgCMV and provide extensive benchmark results by experimenting with existing baselines and latest open source models. This work introduces a novel KP extraction dataset for long-context online discussions, setting the stage for the next generation of LLM-driven summarization research.

  We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) research follows a closed-domain assumption. However, there is no clear consensus on emotion classification in psychology, which presents a challenge for models when it comes to recognizing previously unseen emotions in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unseen Emotion Recognition in Conversation (UERC) task for the first time and propose ProEmoTrans, a solid prototype-based emotion transfer framework. This prototype-based approach shows promise but still faces key challenges: First, implicit expressions complicate emotion definition, which we address by proposing an LLM-enhanced description approach. Second, utterance encoding in long conversations is difficult, which we tackle with a proposed parameter-free mechanism for efficient encoding and overfitting prevention. Finally, the Markovian flow nature of emotions is hard to transfer, which we address with an improved Attention Viterbi Decoding (AVD) method to transfer seen emotion transitions to unseen emotions. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method serves as a strong baseline for preliminary exploration in this new area.

  The code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced applications like tool invocation and problem-solving. However, improving performance in code-related tasks remains challenging due to limited training data that is verifiable with accurate test cases. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise, existing methods for generating test cases still face limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that splits code snippets into smaller, granular blocks, creating more diverse DPO pairs from the same test cases. Additionally, we introduce the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) splitting and curriculum training method to enhance the DPO training. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in code generation tasks, as validated by experiments on benchmark datasets such as HumanEval (+), MBPP (+), APPS, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion language models have shown strong potential for text generation, yet standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) misaligns with their semi-autoregressive inference: training randomly masks tokens across the entire response, while inference generates fixed-size blocks sequentially. This mismatch introduces noisy prefixes and leaky suffixes, biasing gradients away from the desired blockwise likelihood. We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets. Block size consistency studies and ablations confirm that improvements stem from faithful training-inference alignment rather than incidental masking effects. Our results highlight the importance of matching supervision granularity to the decoding procedure in diffusion-based language models.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of domains, including logical reasoning, mathematics, and more. In this paper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule interactions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a dataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards are classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our evaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs, they struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We categorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game states, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future research to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and their interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-resource machine translation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack exposure to these languages during pretraining and have limited parallel data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel approach that enhances translation for low-resource languages by integrating an external dictionary tool and training models end-to-end using reinforcement learning, in addition to supervised fine-tuning. Focusing on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented decision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual dictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning with Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both when and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as rewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our tool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work, and a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary access, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared Task. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the effects of model architecture and training strategy, comparing Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with other models such as LLaMA and a prior NLLB-based system. These findings highlight the promise of combining LLMs with external tools and the role of reinforcement learning in improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.

  \Abstract{In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal significance as imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}

  The disparity in language resources poses a challenge in multilingual NLP, with high-resource languages benefiting from extensive data, while low-resource languages lack sufficient data for effective training. Our Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) method addresses this gap by integrating contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations, facilitating task-specific knowledge transfer from high-resource to lower-resource languages. The primary advantage of our approach is its data efficiency, enabling rapid adaptation to new languages and reducing the need for large labeled datasets. We conduct experiments with multilingual encoder-only and decoder-only language models on natural language understanding tasks, including natural language inference and relation extraction, evaluating performance across both high- and low-resource languages. Our results demonstrate that CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context learning, even with limited available data. This effectively narrows the cross-lingual performance gap, contributing to the development of more efficient multilingual NLP techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humor is a broad and complex form of communication that remains challenging for machines. Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work, we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes, anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing different humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3 datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%) with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests relations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best enabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and code.

  Existing long-context benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on evaluating comprehension of long inputs, while overlooking the evaluation of long reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce LongReasonArena, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the long reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our tasks require models to solve problems by executing multi-step algorithms that reflect key aspects of long reasoning, such as retrieval and backtracking. By controlling the inputs, the required reasoning length can be arbitrarily scaled, reaching up to 1 million tokens of reasoning for the most challenging tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for both open-source and proprietary LLMs. For instance, Deepseek-R1 achieves only 7.5% accuracy on our task. Further analysis also reveals that the accuracy exhibits a linear decline with respect to the logarithm of the expected number of reasoning steps. Our code and data is available atthis https URL.

  Event Extraction (EE) involves automatically identifying and extracting structured information about events from unstructured text, including triggers, event types, and arguments. Traditional discriminative models demonstrate high precision but often exhibit limited recall, particularly for nuanced or infrequent events. Conversely, generative approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) provide higher semantic flexibility and recall but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent predictions. To address these challenges, we propose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach combining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger. ARIS explicitly leverages structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering, and an LLM reflective inference module to reliably resolve ambiguities and enhance overall event prediction quality. We further investigate decomposed instruction fine-tuning for enhanced LLM event extraction understanding. Experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks but are prone to hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these by grounding LLMs in external knowledge. However, in complex domains involving multiple, lengthy, or conflicting documents, traditional RAG suffers from information overload and inefficient synthesis, leading to inaccurate and untrustworthy answers. To address this, we propose CASC (Context-Adaptive Synthesis and Compression), a novel framework that intelligently processes retrieved contexts. CASC introduces a Context Analyzer & Synthesizer (CAS) module, powered by a fine-tuned smaller LLM, which performs key information extraction, cross-document consistency checking and conflict resolution, and question-oriented structured synthesis. This process transforms raw, scattered information into a highly condensed, structured, and semantically rich context, significantly reducing the token count and cognitive load for the final Reader LLM. We evaluate CASC on SciDocs-QA, a new challenging multi-document question answering dataset designed for complex scientific domains with inherent redundancies and conflicts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CASC consistently outperforms strong baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the timeliness of knowledge and the factual accuracy of responses in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and applies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In countries without civil registration and vital statistics, verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating cause of death (COD) and inform policy priorities. In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the circumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and structured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms only use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this thesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD classification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that with the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning outperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and population levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We explore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions in unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD classification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may capture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also characterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe variations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that classification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and models. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the intersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health. It demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification. Our findings underscore the need for more high-quality data from more diverse settings to use in training and fine-tuning PLM/ML methods, and offer valuable insights to guide the rethinking and redesign of the VA instrument and interview.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an important aspect of conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) when factually correct information is important. LLMs may provide answers that appear correct, but could contain hallucinated information. Thus, building benchmarks that can evaluate LLMs on multi-turn RAG conversations has become an increasingly important task. Simulating real-world conversations is vital for producing high quality evaluation benchmarks. We present RAGAPHENE, a chat-based annotation platform that enables annotators to simulate real-world conversations for benchmarking and evaluating LLMs. RAGAPHENE has been successfully used by approximately 40 annotators to build thousands of real-world conversations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt-based reasoning strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) have become widely used for eliciting reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA), constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K (multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. Our results highlight a promising shift toward trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs via lightweight, automaton-guided memory.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-lingual phoneme recognition has emerged as a significant challenge for accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) when mixing Vietnamese and English pronunciations. Unlike many languages, Vietnamese relies on tonal variations to distinguish word meanings, whereas English features stress patterns and non-standard pronunciations that hinder phoneme alignment between the two languages. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bilingual speech recognition approach with two primary contributions: (1) constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set that bridges the differences between Vietnamese and English phonetic systems; (2) designing an end-to-end system that leverages the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level representations to improve phoneme recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese but also provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition

  Despite LLMs' excellent code creation capabilities, multilingual code generation remains extremely challenging. To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts, including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting \emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning, \emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes. We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:this https URL

  _Chenxi Zhou, Pengfei Cao, Jiang Li, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve targeted cognitive functions.

  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Faithful generation in large language models (LLMs) is challenged by knowledge conflicts between parametric memory and external context. Existing contrastive decoding methods tuned specifically to handle conflict often lack adaptability and can degrade performance in low conflict settings. We introduce CoCoA (Confidence- and Context-Aware Adaptive Decoding), a novel token-level algorithm for principled conflict resolution and enhanced faithfulness. CoCoA resolves conflict by utilizing confidence-aware measures (entropy gap and contextual peakedness) and the generalized divergence between the parametric and contextual distributions. Crucially, CoCoA maintains strong performance even in low conflict settings. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs on diverse Question Answering (QA), Summarization, and Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA) benchmarks demonstrate CoCoA's state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines like AdaCAD. It yields significant gains in QA accuracy, up to 9.2 points on average compared to the strong baseline AdaCAD, and improves factuality in summarization and LFQA by up to 2.5 points on average across key benchmarks. Additionally, it demonstrates superior sensitivity to conflict variations. CoCoA enables more informed, context-aware, and ultimately more faithful token generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments, motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover, these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy, we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less temporal redundancy.

  State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors.

  The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models (LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity. The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety alignment. Our dataset and code are released to the public to facilitate further research in the field of multilingual LLM safety.

  Low-resource languages such as Sinhala are often overlooked by open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). In this research, we extend an existing multilingual LLM (Llama-3-8B) to better serve Sinhala. We enhance the LLM tokenizer with Sinhala specific vocabulary and perform continual pre-training on a cleaned 10 million Sinhala corpus, resulting in the SinLlama model. This is the very first decoder-based open-source LLM with explicit Sinhala support. When SinLlama was instruction fine-tuned for three text classification tasks, it outperformed base and instruct variants of Llama-3-8B by a significant margin.

  The alignment of large language models (LLMs) aims to ensure their outputs adhere to human values, ethical standards, and legal norms. Traditional alignment methods often rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning (FT), which may suffer from knowledge degradation and face challenges in scenarios where the model accessibility or computational resources are constrained. In contrast, training-free (TF) alignment techniques--leveraging in-context learning, decoding-time adjustments, and post-generation corrections--offer a promising alternative by enabling alignment without heavily retraining LLMs, making them adaptable to both open-source and closed-source environments. This paper presents the first systematic review of TF alignment methods, categorizing them by stages of pre-decoding, in-decoding, and post-decoding. For each stage, we provide a detailed examination from the viewpoint of LLMs and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), highlighting their mechanisms and limitations. Furthermore, we identify key challenges and future directions, paving the way for more inclusive and effective TF alignment techniques. By synthesizing and organizing the rapidly growing body of research, this survey offers a guidance for practitioners and advances the development of safer and more reliable LLMs.

  Scientific reasoning is critical for developing AI scientists and supporting human researchers in advancing the frontiers of natural science discovery. However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

  LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.

  Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2) learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages, rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations, comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Our system is based on a neural network translation approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size, and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model links are available onthis https URL.

  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning. However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration, and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources, guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo. The source code is available onthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and judge models: being the same model, belonging to the same model family, being independent models, and having an distillation relationship. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, three datasets, four generator models, and 15 judge models, complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual modes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and task learning (inference-time ''learning'' from demonstrations). However, disentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL CIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed from classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the in-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering English sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there is a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This bijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task in some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question if LLMs can solve tasks reformulated by ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires ''deciphering'' the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving tasks reformulated by ICL CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline, providing a novel approach to quantify ''learning'' in ICL. While this gap is small, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models. Finally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in their ability to decode the ciphered inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ontology-based question generation is an important application of semantic-aware systems that enables the creation of large question banks for diverse learning environments. The effectiveness of these systems, both in terms of the calibre and cognitive difficulty of the resulting questions, depends heavily on the quality and modelling approach of the underlying ontologies, making it crucial to assess their fitness for this task. To date, there has been no comprehensive investigation into the specific ontology aspects or characteristics that affect the question generation process. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metrics for evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks in pedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology (a structured framework used for identifying task-specific metrics), a set of evaluation metrics have been derived from an expert assessment of questions generated by a question generation model. To validate the proposed metrics, we apply them to a set of ontologies previously used in question generation to illustrate how the metric scores align with and complement findings reported in earlier studies. The analysis confirms that ontology characteristics significantly impact the effectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibiting varying performance levels. This highlights the importance of assessing ontology quality with respect to Automatic Question Generation (AQG) tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  News articles are more than collections of facts; they reflect journalists' framing, shaping how events are presented to the audience. One key aspect of framing is the choice to write in (or quote verbatim) morally charged language as opposed to using neutral terms. This moral framing carries implicit judgments that automated news summarizers should recognize and preserve to maintain the original intent of the writer. In this work, we perform the first study on the preservation of moral framing in AI-generated news summaries. We propose an approach that leverages the intuition that journalists intentionally use or report specific moral-laden words, which should be retained in summaries. Through automated, crowd-sourced, and expert evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the preservation of moral framing while maintaining overall summary quality.

  The assumption across nearly all language model (LM) tokenization schemes is that tokens should be subwords, i.e., contained within word boundaries. While providing a seemingly reasonable inductive bias, is this common practice limiting the potential of modern LMs? Whitespace is not a reliable delimiter of meaning, as evidenced by multi-word expressions (e.g., "by the way"), crosslingual variation in the number of words needed to express a concept (e.g., "spacesuit helmet" in German is "raumanzughelm"), and languages that do not use whitespace at all (e.g., Chinese). To explore the potential of tokenization beyond subwords, we introduce a "superword" tokenizer, SuperBPE, which incorporates a simple pretokenization curriculum into the byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm to first learn subwords, then superwords that bridge whitespace. This brings dramatic improvements in encoding efficiency: when fixing the vocabulary size to 200k, SuperBPE encodes a fixed piece of text with up to 33% fewer tokens than BPE on average. In experiments, we pretrain 8B transformer LMs from scratch while fixing the model size, vocabulary size, and train compute, varying *only* the algorithm for learning the vocabulary. Our model trained with SuperBPE achieves an average +4.0% absolute improvement over the BPE baseline across 30 downstream tasks (including +8.2% on MMLU), while simultaneously requiring 27% less compute at inference time. In analysis, we find that SuperBPE results in segmentations of text that are more uniform in per-token difficulty. Qualitatively, this may be because SuperBPE tokens often capture common multi-word expressions that function semantically as a single unit. SuperBPE is a straightforward, local modification to tokenization that improves both encoding efficiency and downstream performance, yielding better language models overall.

  We present KoWit-24, a dataset with fine-grained annotation of wordplay in 2,700 Russian news headlines. KoWit-24 annotations include the presence of wordplay, its type, wordplay anchors, and words/phrases the wordplay refers to. Unlike the majority of existing humor collections of canned jokes, KoWit-24 provides wordplay contexts -- each headline is accompanied by the news lead and summary. The most common type of wordplay in the dataset is the transformation of collocations, idioms, and named entities -- the mechanism that has been underrepresented in previous humor datasets. Our experiments with five LLMs show that there is ample room for improvement in wordplay detection and interpretation tasks. The dataset and evaluation scripts are available atthis https URL

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the task, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The interpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the researchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify 1420 children's scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific themes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for children's scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for follow-up children's drawing research. The results show that the representation of most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity>0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the representation is independent of the accuracy (of LLM's recognition), indicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of influencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to investigate the effects of "sample size", "abstract degree", and "focus points" on drawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children represented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class. It was found that accuracy (of LLM's recognition) is the most sensitive indicator, and data such as sample size and semantic similarity are related to it; The consistency between classroom experiments and teaching purpose is also an important factor, many students focus more on the experiments themselves rather than what they explain.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) typically relies on producing large sets of input-output pairs. Yet for a given question, there can be many valid outputs. In practice, these outputs are often derived by distilling knowledge from teacher models, and they can vary depending on the specific teacher model or prompting strategy employed. Recent findings show that how these training outputs are generated can significantly affect the performance of the fine-tuned model, raising an important question: how do we pick the best data generation method from among numerous possibilities? Rather than exhaustively training and evaluating on each candidate, this paper proposes a scalable approximate method that assesses a small subset of generated data to estimate its suitability for a specific target LLM. Our central idea is that effective outputs should be familiar to the target LLM. While previous work measures familiarity with perplexity, we find that perplexity might be suboptimal in characterizing familiarity through empirical analyses and practical observations. To address this, we introduce self-aligned perplexity, a novel metric capturing how closely candidate outputs adhere to the target LLM's own style and reasoning patterns. In this way, we can identify the most effective generation strategy on a small sample, then apply it to produce the complete training set. We demonstrate that training on data generated by the chosen method yields significant improvements across diverse reasoning-focused benchmarks, particularly in cases where different candidate methods lead to highly divergent training outcomes. Our implementation is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress in mathematical reasoning, yet often rely on single-paradigm reasoning, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. We introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a novel unified framework integrating multiple reasoning paradigms--Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning (SR)--to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential answers via different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy for models to progressively master these paradigms, leading to CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving and a 15.0% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic tasks. These results show the enhanced mathematical comprehension ability of our model, enabling zero-shot generalization across tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated near-human performance in summarization tasks based on traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore. However, these metrics do not adequately capture critical aspects of summarization quality, such as factual accuracy, particularly for long narratives (>100K tokens). Recent advances, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, address the limitations of metrics based on lexical similarity but still exhibit factual inconsistencies, especially in understanding character relationships and states. In this work, we introduce NarrativeFactScore, a novel "Agent-as-a-Judge" framework for evaluating and refining summaries. By leveraging a Character Knowledge Graph (CKG) extracted from input and generated summaries, NarrativeFactScore assesses the factual consistency and provides actionable guidance for refinement, such as identifying missing or erroneous facts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NarrativeFactScore through a detailed workflow illustration and extensive validation on widely adopted benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to competitive methods. Our results highlight the potential of agent-driven evaluation systems to improve the factual reliability of LLM-generated summaries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, notably degrading the safety of originally aligned models. While some existing methods attempt to restore safety by incorporating additional safety data, the quality of such data typically falls short of that used in the original alignment process. Moreover, these high-quality safety datasets are generally inaccessible, making it difficult to fully recover the model's original safety. We ask: How can we preserve safety while improving downstream task performance without additional safety data? We show that simply merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned models effectively mitigates safety degradation while enhancing performance. Experiments across different downstream tasks and models validate the method's practicality and effectiveness.

  Adapting general multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to specific domains, such as scientific and industrial fields, is highly significant in promoting their practical applications. This paper systematically investigates domain adaptation of MLLMs via post-training, focusing on data synthesis, training pipeline, and task evaluation. (1) Data Synthesis: Using only open-source models, we develop a generate-then-filter pipeline that curates diverse visual instruction tasks based on domain-specific image-caption pairs. The resulting data surpass the data synthesized by manual rules or strong closed-source models in enhancing domain-specific performance. (2) Training Pipeline: Unlike general MLLMs that typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm, we find that a single-stage approach is more effective for domain adaptation. (3) Task Evaluation: We conduct extensive experiments in high-impact domains such as biomedicine, food, and remote sensing, by post-training a variety of MLLMs and then evaluating MLLM performance on various domain-specific tasks. Finally, we fully open-source our models, code, and data to encourage future research in this area.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their reasoning abilities remain underexplored. Existing benchmarks tend to focus on perception or text-based comprehension, offering limited insight into how well these models perform on structured, logic-driven tasks that require both visual and linguistic reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce NPHardEval4V, a multimodal benchmark suite grounded in four classical NP-hard problems: Knapsack, Set Cover, Traveling Salesperson, and Vertex Cover. Each task is presented through a combination of structured visual layouts and textual prompts, designed to assess the ability of LVLMs to perform combinatorial reasoning under visual-linguistic constraints. We evaluate a set of advanced open-source and closed-source vision-language models under a unified prompting and problem representation framework. This enables fair comparison across models and task types, while isolating key variables affecting performance. Our results show that while these models perform reasonably well on perception-based inputs, they struggle with global optimization, abstraction, and constraint satisfaction. No single model demonstrates consistent reasoning capability across all problem types, and common failure patterns reveal fundamental limitations in current architectures. By leveraging the structure and complexity of NP-hard problems, NPHardEval4V provides a scalable, interpretable, and challenging testbed for diagnosing reasoning behaviors in LVLMs. We hope this benchmark can support the community in building more robust, inference-capable multimodal systems. The benchmark dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  The growing prevalence and rapid evolution of offensive language in social media amplify the complexities of detection, particularly highlighting the challenges in identifying such content across diverse languages. This survey presents a systematic and comprehensive exploration of Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning (CLTL) techniques in offensive language detection in social media. Our study stands as the first holistic overview to focus exclusively on the cross-lingual scenario in this domain. We analyse 67 relevant papers and categorise these studies across various dimensions, including the characteristics of multilingual datasets used, the cross-lingual resources employed, and the specific CLTL strategies implemented. According to "what to transfer", we also summarise three main CLTL transfer approaches: instance, feature, and parameter transfer. Additionally, we shed light on the current challenges and future research opportunities in this field. Furthermore, we have made our survey resources available online, including two comprehensive tables that provide accessible references to the multilingual datasets and CLTL methods used in the reviewed literature.

  Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant challenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both long-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness. Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor (Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner. This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization. Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark, CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art among open-source models.

  Labelling images of Lepidoptera (moths) from automated camera systems is vital for understanding insect declines. However, accurate species identification is challenging due to domain shifts between curated images and noisy field imagery. We propose a lightweight classification approach, combining limited expert-labelled field data with knowledge distillation from the high-performance BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tiny architecture. Experiments on 101 Danish moth species from AMI camera systems demonstrate that BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods and that our distilled lightweight model achieves comparable accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost. These insights offer practical guidelines for the development of efficient insect monitoring systems and bridging domain gaps for fine-grained classification.

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA decoders either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone, demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, event detection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-captured and satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a joint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these methods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training, which rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as urban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather frequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where only partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this source of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current research. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy Correspondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this end, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a novel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated data uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential co-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high correspondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature learning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from traditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty and loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing robust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves superior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods in various noise ratios.

  Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent eye condition affecting visual acuity. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatments have been effective in slowing the progression of neovascular AMD, with better outcomes achieved through timely diagnosis and consistent monitoring. Tracking the progression of neovascular activity in OCT scans of patients with exudative AMD allows for the development of more personalized and effective treatment plans. This was the focus of the Monitoring Age-related Macular Degeneration Progression in Optical Coherence Tomography (MARIO) challenge, in which we participated. In Task 1, which involved classifying the evolution between two pairs of 2D slices from consecutive OCT acquisitions, we employed a fusion CNN network with model ensembling to further enhance the model's performance. For Task 2, which focused on predicting progression over the next three months based on current exam data, we proposed the Patch Progression Masked Autoencoder that generates an OCT for the next exam and then classifies the evolution between the current OCT and the one generated using our solution from Task 1. The results we achieved allowed us to place in the Top 10 for both tasks. Some team members are part of the same organization as the challenge organizers; therefore, we are not eligible to compete for the prize.

  Open-vocabulary (OV) 3D object detection is an emerging field, yet its exploration through image-based methods remains limited compared to 3D point cloud-based methods. We introduce OpenM3D, a novel open-vocabulary multi-view indoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations. In particular, OpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from the ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic 3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a voxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features. We follow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given but no human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3D Pseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2D segments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precision and recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. We further sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with each coherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key to training a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to be learned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficient detector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superior accuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoor benchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stage method that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OV classifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on both accuracy and speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In dynamic environments, unfamiliar objects and distribution shifts are often encountered, which challenge the generalization abilities of the deployed trained models. This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision Language Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains continuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation approaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes, our framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label shifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal, we establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for VLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples potentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a segmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is training free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine active sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen classes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the potential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world scenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.

  Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language understanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to natural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a discriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based on semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this domain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image diffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation data via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform diffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion models-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we propose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates segmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of generating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the generative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise, conditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description. This paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic Narrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for multimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by narrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.

  Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.

  Geo-localization is the task of identifying the location of an image using visual cues alone. It has beneficial applications, such as improving disaster response, enhancing navigation, and geography education. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly demonstrating capabilities as accurate image geo-locators. This brings significant privacy risks, including those related to stalking and surveillance, considering the widespread uses of AI models and sharing of photos on social media. The precision of these models is likely to improve in the future. Despite these risks, there is little work on systematically evaluating the geolocation precision of Generative VLMs, their limits and potential for unintended inferences. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the geolocation capabilities of 25 state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse environments. Our results offer insight into the internal reasoning of VLMs and highlight their strengths, limitations, and potential societal risks. Our findings indicate that current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level images yet achieve notably high accuracy (61\%) on images resembling social media content, raising significant and urgent privacy concerns.

  Understanding and reasoning over text within visual contexts poses a significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), given the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, text-rich Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap, we introduce KRETA, a benchmark for Korean Reading and rEasoning in Text-rich VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types. Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise image decomposition and a rigorous seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure data quality. While KRETA is tailored for Korean, we hope our adaptable and extensible pipeline will facilitate the development of similar benchmarks in other languages, thereby accelerating multilingual VLM research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have demonstrated promising performance in computer vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR). The quadratic computational complexity of window self-attention mechanisms in many transformer-based SR methods forces the use of small, fixed windows, limiting the receptive field. In this paper, we propose a new approach by embedding the wavelet transform within a hierarchical transformer framework, called (WaveHiT-SR). First, using adaptive hierarchical windows instead of static small windows allows to capture features across different levels and greatly improve the ability to model long-range dependencies. Secondly, the proposed model utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose images into multiple frequency subbands, allowing the network to focus on both global and local features while preserving structural details. By progressively reconstructing high-resolution images through hierarchical processing, the network reduces computational complexity without sacrificing performance. The multi-level decomposition strategy enables the network to capture fine-grained information in lowfrequency components while enhancing high-frequency textures. Through extensive experimentation, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our WaveHiT-SR. Our refined versions of SwinIR-Light, SwinIR-NG, and SRFormer-Light deliver cutting-edge SR results, achieving higher efficiency with fewer parameters, lower FLOPs, and faster speeds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current methods for 3D semantic segmentation propose training models with limited annotations to address the difficulty of annotating large, irregular, and unordered 3D point cloud data. They usually focus on the 3D domain only, without leveraging the complementary nature of 2D and 3D data. Besides, some methods extend original labels or generate pseudo labels to guide the training, but they often fail to fully use these labels or address the noise within them. Meanwhile, the emergence of comprehensive and adaptable foundation models has offered effective solutions for segmenting 2D data. Leveraging this advancement, we present a novel approach that maximizes the utility of sparsely available 3D annotations by incorporating segmentation masks generated by 2D foundation models. We further propagate the 2D segmentation masks into the 3D space by establishing geometric correspondences between 3D scenes and 2D views. We extend the highly sparse annotations to encompass the areas delineated by 3D masks, thereby substantially augmenting the pool of available labels. Furthermore, we apply confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency regularization on augmentations of the 3D point cloud and select the reliable pseudo labels, which are further spread on the 3D masks to generate more labels. This innovative strategy bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations and the powerful capabilities of 2D foundation models, ultimately improving the performance of 3D weakly supervised segmentation.

  Active learning (AL) for real-world object detection faces computational and reliability challenges that limit practical deployment. Developing new AL methods requires training multiple detectors across iterations to compare against existing approaches. This creates high costs for autonomous driving datasets where the training of one detector requires up to 282 GPU hours. Additionally, AL method rankings vary substantially across validation sets, compromising reliability in safety-critical transportation systems. We introduce object-based set similarity ($\mathrm{OSS}$), a metric that addresses these challenges. $\mathrm{OSS}$ (1) quantifies AL method effectiveness without requiring detector training by measuring similarity between training sets and target domains using object-level features. This enables the elimination of ineffective AL methods before training. Furthermore, $\mathrm{OSS}$ (2) enables the selection of representative validation sets for robust evaluation. We validate our similarity-based approach on three autonomous driving datasets (KITTI, BDD100K, CODA) using uncertainty-based AL methods as a case study with two detector architectures (EfficientDet, YOLOv3). This work is the first to unify AL training and evaluation strategies in object detection based on object similarity. $\mathrm{OSS}$ is detector-agnostic, requires only labeled object crops, and integrates with existing AL pipelines. This provides a practical framework for deploying AL in real-world applications where computational efficiency and evaluation reliability are critical. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in motion generation show remarkable progress. However, several limitations remain: (1) Existing pose-guided character motion transfer methods merely replicate motion without learning its style characteristics, resulting in inexpressive characters. (2) Motion style transfer methods rely heavily on motion capture data, which is difficult to obtain. (3) Generated motions sometimes violate physical laws. To address these challenges, this paper pioneers a new task: Video-to-Video Motion Personalization. We propose a novel framework, PersonaAnimator, which learns personalized motion patterns directly from unconstrained videos. This enables personalized motion transfer. To support this task, we introduce PersonaVid, the first video-based personalized motion dataset. It contains 20 motion content categories and 120 motion style categories. We further propose a Physics-aware Motion Style Regularization mechanism to enforce physical plausibility in the generated motions. Extensive experiments show that PersonaAnimator outperforms state-of-the-art motion transfer methods and sets a new benchmark for the Video-to-Video Motion Personalization task.

  Monitoring urban tree dynamics is vital for supporting greening policies and reducing risks to electrical infrastructure. Airborne laser scanning has advanced large-scale tree management, but challenges remain due to complex urban environments and tree variability. Multispectral (MS) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) improves this by capturing both 3D spatial and spectral data, enabling detailed mapping. This study explores tree point extraction using MS-LiDAR and deep learning (DL) models. Three state-of-the-art models are evaluated: Superpoint Transformer (SPT), Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), and Point Transformer V1 (PTv1). Results show the notable time efficiency and accuracy of SPT, with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 85.28%. The highest detection accuracy is achieved by incorporating pseudo normalized difference vegetation index (pNDVI) with spatial data, reducing error rate by 10.61 percentage points (pp) compared to using spatial information alone. These findings highlight the potential of MS-LiDAR and DL to improve tree extraction and further tree inventories.

  Sky background subtraction is a critical step in Multi-objective Fiber spectra process. However, current subtraction relies mainly on sky fiber spectra to build Super Sky. These average spectra are lacking in the modeling of the environment surrounding the objects. To address this issue, a sky background estimation model: Sky background building based on Mutual Information (SMI) is proposed. SMI based on mutual information and incremental training approach. It utilizes spectra from all fibers in the plate to estimate the sky background. SMI contains two main networks, the first network applies a wavelength calibration module to extract sky features from spectra, and can effectively solve the feature shift problem according to the corresponding emission position. The second network employs an incremental training approach to maximize mutual information between representations of different spectra to capturing the common component. Then, it minimizes the mutual information between adjoining spectra representations to obtain individual components. This network yields an individual sky background at each location of the object. To verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, we conducted experiments on the spectra of LAMOST. Results show that SMI can obtain a better object sky background during the observation, especially in the blue end.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the introduction of vehicles with autonomous capabilities on public roads, predicting pedestrian crossing intention has emerged as an active area of research. The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches: a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images. By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of performance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most commonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful technique for learning visual representations. While recent SSL approaches achieve strong results in global image understanding, they are limited in capturing the structured representation in scenes. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach that progressively builds structured visual representations by combining semantic grouping, instance level separation, and hierarchical structuring. Our approach, based on a novel ProtoScale module, captures visual elements across multiple spatial scales. Unlike common strategies like DINO that rely on random cropping and global embeddings, we preserve full scene context across augmented views to improve performance in dense prediction tasks. We validate our method on downstream object detection tasks using a combined subset of multiple datasets (COCO and UA-DETRAC). Experimental results show that our method learns object centric representations that enhance supervised object detection and outperform the state-of-the-art methods, even when trained with limited annotated data and fewer fine-tuning epochs.

  Personalized, accurate prediction of aortic aneurysm progression is essential for timely intervention but remains challenging due to the need to model both subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes within complex 3D geometries. We propose MCMeshGAN, the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh generative adversarial network for 3D aneurysm growth prediction. MCMeshGAN introduces a dual-branch architecture combining a novel local KNN-based convolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine-grained geometric details and a global graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range structural context, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time interval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions, enabling retrospective and prospective modeling. We curated TAAMesh, a new longitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset consisting of 590 multimodal records (CT scans, 3D meshes, and clinical data) from 208 patients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important diameter estimation. This framework offers a robust step toward clinically deployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling. The source code for MCMeshGAN and the baseline methods is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine vision systems (MVS) are intrinsically vulnerable to performance degradation under adverse visual conditions. To address this, we propose a machine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework that quantifies the impact of image degradations on MVS performance. We establish an MIQA paradigm encompassing the end-to-end assessment workflow. To support this, we construct a machine-centric image quality database (MIQD-2.5M), comprising 2.5 million samples that capture distinctive degradation responses in both consistency and accuracy metrics, spanning 75 vision models, 250 degradation types, and three representative vision tasks. We further propose a region-aware MIQA (RA-MIQA) model to evaluate MVS visual quality through fine-grained spatial degradation analysis. Extensive experiments benchmark the proposed RA-MIQA against seven human visual system (HVS)-based IQA metrics and five retrained classical backbones. Results demonstrate RA-MIQA's superior performance in multiple dimensions, e.g., achieving SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on accuracy for image classification, while also revealing task-specific degradation sensitivities. Critically, HVS-based metrics prove inadequate for MVS quality prediction, while even specialized MIQA models struggle with background degradations, accuracy-oriented estimation, and subtle distortions. This study can advance MVS reliability and establish foundations for machine-centric image processing and optimization. The model and code are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks often produce overconfident predictions, undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. This miscalibration is further exacerbated under distribution shift, where test data deviates from the training distribution due to environmental or acquisition changes. While existing approaches improve calibration through training-time regularization or post-hoc adjustment, their reliance on access to or simulation of target domains limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration framework that operates without access to target domain information. From a frequency-domain perspective, we identify that distribution shifts often distort high-frequency visual cues exploited by deep models, and introduce a low-frequency filtering strategy to encourage reliance on domain-invariant features. However, such information loss may degrade In-Distribution (ID) calibration performance. Therefore, we further propose a gradient-based rectification mechanism that enforces ID calibration as a hard constraint during optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world shifted datasets, including CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS, demonstrate that our method significantly improves calibration under distribution shift while maintaining strong in-distribution performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated segmentation of the fetal head in ultrasound images is critical for prenatal monitoring. However, achieving robust segmentation remains challenging due to the poor quality of ultrasound images and the lack of annotated data. Semi-supervised methods alleviate the lack of annotated data but struggle with the unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images, making it challenging to generate reliable pseudo-labels and enforce effective consistency regularization constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework, ERSR, for fetal head ultrasound segmentation. Our framework consists of the dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy, the ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and the symmetry-based multiple consistency regularization. The dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy uses boundary consistency and contour regularity criteria to evaluate and filter teacher outputs. The ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement refines these filtered outputs by fitting least-squares ellipses, which strengthens pixels near the center of the fitted ellipse and suppresses noise simultaneously. The symmetry-based multiple consistency regularization enforces multi-level consistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between original predictions and pseudo-labels, enabling the model to capture robust and stable shape representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks. On the HC18 dataset, it reaches Dice scores of 92.05% and 95.36% with 10% and 20% labeled data, respectively. On the PSFH dataset, the scores are 91.68% and 93.70% under the same settings.

  Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) faces significant annotation challenges due to its dual requirements of pixel-level masks and temporal consistency labels. While recent unsupervised methods like VideoCutLER eliminate optical flow dependencies through synthetic data, they remain constrained by the synthetic-to-real domain gap. We present AutoQ-VIS, a novel unsupervised framework that bridges this gap through quality-guided self-training. Our approach establishes a closed-loop system between pseudo-label generation and automatic quality assessment, enabling progressive adaptation from synthetic to real videos. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 52.6 $\text{AP}_{50}$ on YouTubeVIS-2019 val set, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art VideoCutLER by 4.4$\%$, while requiring no human annotations. This demonstrates the viability of quality-aware self-training for unsupervised VIS. The source code of our method is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mitotic figure (MF) detection in histopathology images is challenging due to large variations in slide scanners, staining protocols, tissue types, and the presence of artifacts. This paper presents a collection of training techniques - a bag of tricks - that enable robust, real-time MF detection across diverse domains. We build on the efficient RTMDet single stage object detector to achieve high inference speed suitable for clinical deployment. Our method addresses scanner variability and tumor heterogeneity via extensive multi-domain training data, balanced sampling, and careful augmentation. Additionally, we employ targeted, hard negative mining on necrotic and debris tissue to reduce false positives. In a grouped 5-fold cross-validation across multiple MF datasets, our model achieves an F1 score between 0.78 and 0.84. On the preliminary test set of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge, our single-stage RTMDet-S based approach reaches an F1 of 0.81, outperforming larger models and demonstrating adaptability to new, unfamiliar domains. The proposed solution offers a practical trade-off between accuracy and speed, making it attractive for real-world clinical adoption.

  In the realm of waste management, automating the sorting process for non-biodegradable materials presents considerable challenges due to the complexity and variability of waste streams. To address these challenges, we introduce an enhanced neural architecture that builds upon an existing Encoder-Decoder structure to improve the accuracy and efficiency of waste sorting systems. Our model integrates several key innovations: a Comprehensive Attention Block within the decoder, which refines feature representations by combining convolutional and upsampling operations. In parallel, we utilize attention through the Mamba architecture, providing an additional performance boost. We also introduce a Data Fusion Block that fuses images with more than three channels. To achieve this, we apply PCA transformation to reduce the dimensionality while retaining the maximum variance and essential information across three dimensions, which are then used for further processing. We evaluated the model on RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral, and a combination of RGB and hyperspectral data. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by a significant margin.

  Text-to-image generation has recently seen remarkable success, granting users with the ability to create high-quality images through the use of text. However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations, which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation. Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics, considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recovering material information from images has been extensively studied in computer graphics and vision. Recent works in material estimation leverage diffusion model showing promising results. However, these diffusion-based methods adopt a multi-step denoising strategy, which is time-consuming for each estimation. Such stochastic inference also conflicts with the deterministic material estimation task, leading to a high variance estimated results. In this paper, we introduce StableIntrinsic, a one-step diffusion model for multi-view material estimation that can produce high-quality material parameters with low variance. To address the overly-smoothing problem in one-step diffusion, StableIntrinsic applies losses in pixel space, with each loss designed based on the properties of the material. Additionally, StableIntrinsic introduces a Detail Injection Network (DIN) to eliminate the detail loss caused by VAE encoding, while further enhancing the sharpness of material prediction results. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art techniques by achieving a $9.9\%$ improvement in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of albedo, and by reducing the Mean Square Error (MSE) for metallic and roughness by $44.4\%$ and $60.0\%$, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting, known for enabling high-quality static scene reconstruction with fast rendering, is increasingly being applied to dynamic scene reconstruction. A common strategy involves learning a deformation field to model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However, these deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine motion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a single, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that distinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D Gaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their deformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized modeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs are treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal partitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual discontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we introduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual continuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with complex or rapid motions.

  Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition is foundational for educational technologies, enabling applications like digital note-taking and automated grading. While modern encoder-decoder architectures with large language models excel at LaTeX generation, they lack explicit symbol-to-trace alignment, a critical limitation for error analysis, interpretability, and spatially aware interactive applications requiring selective content updates. This paper introduces a structural recognition approach with two innovations: 1 an automatic annotation system that uses a neural network to map LaTeX equations to raw traces, automatically generating annotations for symbol segmentation, classification, and spatial relations, and 2 a modular structural recognition system that independently optimizes segmentation, classification, and relation prediction. By leveraging a dataset enriched with structural annotations from our auto-labeling system, the proposed recognition system combines graph-based trace sorting, a hybrid convolutional-recurrent network, and transformer-based correction to achieve competitive performance on the CROHME-2023 benchmark. Crucially, our structural recognition system generates a complete graph structure that directly links handwritten traces to predicted symbols, enabling transparent error analysis and interpretable outputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.

  Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food production and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to increasing anthropogenic and environmental stressors. To support scalable, automated pollinator monitoring, we introduce BuzzSet, a new large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected in real agricultural field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7856 manually verified and labeled images, with over 8000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were generated using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined via human verification using open-source labeling tools. All images were preprocessed into 256~$\times$~256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide strong baselines using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves high F1-scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybee and bumblebee classes, respectively, with confusion matrix results showing minimal misclassification between these categories. The unidentified class remains more challenging due to label ambiguity and lower sample frequency, yet still contributes useful insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection quality is strong, with a best mAP@0.50 of 0.559. BuzzSet offers a valuable benchmark for small object detection, class separation under label noise, and ecological computer vision.

  Despite significant progress in 3D avatar reconstruction, it still faces challenges such as high time complexity, sensitivity to data quality, and low data utilization. We propose FastAvatar, a feedforward 3D avatar framework capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image, multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model within seconds, using only a single unified model. FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer featuring three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer architecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to predict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating animation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses. Integrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction, i.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input data. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar modeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and highly competitive speed compared to existing methods.

  Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving light field salient object detection (LF SOD). However, most existing models tend to neglect the extraction of prompt information under this task. Meanwhile, traditional models ignore the analysis of frequency-domain information, which leads to small objects being overwhelmed by noise. In this paper, we put forward a novel model called self-prompting light field segment anything model (SPLF-SAM), equipped with unified multi-scale feature embedding block (UMFEB) and a multi-scale adaptive filtering adapter (MAFA). UMFEB is capable of identifying multiple objects of varying sizes, while MAFA, by learning frequency features, effectively prevents small objects from being overwhelmed by noise. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our method over ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) LF SOD methods. Our code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Line segment detection in images has been studied for several decades. Existing line segment detectors can be roughly divided into two categories: generic line segment detectors and wireframe line segment detectors. Generic line segment detectors aim to detect all meaningful line segments in images and traditional approaches usually fall into this category. Recent deep learning based approaches are mostly wireframe line segment detectors. They detect only line segments that are geometrically meaningful and have large spatial support. Due to the difference in the aim of design, the performance of generic line segment detectors for the task of wireframe line segment detection won't be satisfactory, and vice versa. In this work, we propose a robust framework that can be used for both generic line segment detection and wireframe line segment detection. The proposed method is an improved version of the Pixel Orientation Estimation (POE) method. It is thus named as POEv2. POEv2 detects line segments from edge strength maps, and can be combined with any edge detector. We show in our experiments that by combining the proposed POEv2 with an efficient edge detector, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing realism and accessibility of deepfakes have raised critical concerns about media authenticity and information integrity. Despite recent advances, deepfake detection models often struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions, particularly when applied to media content found in the wild. In this work, we present a robust video deepfake detection framework with strong generalization that takes advantage of the rich facial representations learned by face foundation models. Our method is built on top of FSFM, a self-supervised model trained on real face data, and is further fine-tuned using an ensemble of deepfake datasets spanning both face-swapping and face-reenactment manipulations. To enhance discriminative power, we incorporate triplet loss variants during training, guiding the model to produce more separable embeddings between real and fake samples. Additionally, we explore attribution-based supervision schemes, where deepfakes are categorized by manipulation type or source dataset, to assess their impact on generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially in challenging real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing video polyp segmentation (VPS) paradigms usually struggle to balance between spatiotemporal modeling and domain generalization, limiting their applicability in real clinical scenarios. To embrace this challenge, we recast the VPS task as a track-by-detect paradigm that leverages the spatial contexts captured by the image polyp segmentation (IPS) model while integrating the temporal modeling capabilities of segment anything model 2 (SAM2). However, during long-term polyp tracking in colonoscopy videos, SAM2 suffers from error accumulation, resulting in a snowball effect that compromises segmentation stability. We mitigate this issue by repurposing SAM2 as a video polyp segmenter with two training-free modules. In particular, the intra-association filtering module eliminates spatial inaccuracies originating from the detecting stage, reducing false positives. The inter-association refinement module adaptively updates the memory bank to prevent error propagation over time, enhancing temporal coherence. Both modules work synergistically to stabilize SAM2, achieving cutting-edge performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust tracking capabilities of FreeVPS in long-untrimmed colonoscopy videos, underscoring its potential reliable clinical analysis.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a novel explicit representation for 3D scenes, offering both high-fidelity reconstruction and efficient rendering. However, 3DGS lacks 3D segmentation ability, which limits its applicability in tasks that require scene understanding. The identification and isolating of specific object components is crucial. To address this limitation, we propose Label-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (LabelGS), a method that augments the Gaussian representation with objectthis http URLintroduces cross-view consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians and employs a novel Occlusion Analysis Model to avoid overfitting occlusion during optimization, Main Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D Gaussian and Gaussian Projection Filter to avoid Gaussian label conflict. Our approach achieves effective decoupling of Gaussian representations and refines the 3DGS optimization process through a random region sampling strategy, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LabelGS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including Feature-3DGS, in the 3D scene segmentation task. Notably, LabelGS achieves a remarkable 22X speedup in training compared to Feature-3DGS, at a resolution of 1440X1080. Our code will be atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular texture 3D human reconstruction aims to create a complete 3D digital avatar from just a single front-view human RGB image. However, the geometric ambiguity inherent in a single 2D image and the scarcity of 3D human training data are the main obstacles limiting progress in this field. To address these issues, current methods employ prior geometric estimation networks to derive various human geometric forms, such as the SMPL model and normal maps. However, they struggle to integrate these modalities effectively, leading to view inconsistencies, such as facial distortions. To this end, we propose a two-process 3D human reconstruction framework, SAT, which seamlessly learns various prior geometries in a unified manner and reconstructs high-quality textured 3D avatars as the final output. To further facilitate geometry learning, we introduce a Supervisor Feature Regularization module. By employing a multi-view network with the same structure to provide intermediate features as training supervision, these varied geometric priors can be better fused. To tackle data scarcity and further improve reconstruction quality, we also propose an Online Animation Augmentation module. By building a one-feed-forward animation network, we augment a massive number of samples from the original 3D human data online for model training. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  Ultra-Wide-Field (UWF) retinal imaging has revolutionized retinal diagnostics by providing a comprehensive view of the retina. However, it often suffers from quality-degrading factors such as blurring and uneven illumination, which obscure fine details and mask pathological information. While numerous retinal image enhancement methods have been proposed for other fundus imageries, they often fail to address the unique requirements in UWF, particularly the need to preserve pathological details. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware self-supervised learning method for UWF image enhancement. It incorporates frequency-decoupled image deblurring and Retinex-guided illumination compensation modules. An asymmetric channel integration operation is introduced in the former module, so as to combine global and local views by leveraging high- and low-frequency information, ensuring the preservation of fine and broader structural details. In addition, a color preservation unit is proposed in the latter Retinex-based module, to provide multi-scale spatial and frequency information, enabling accurate illumination estimation and correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed work not only enhances visualization quality but also improves disease diagnosis performance by restoring and correcting fine local details and uneven intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt for UWF image enhancement, offering a robust and clinically valuable tool for improving retinal disease management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological intelligence, have long been considered inherently energy-efficient, making them attractive for resource-constrained domains such as space applications. However, recent comparative studies with conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have begun to question this reputation, especially for digital implementations. This work investigates SNNs for multi-output regression, specifically 3-D satellite position estimation from monocular images, and compares hardware-aware and hardware-agnostic energy estimation methods. The proposed SNN, trained using the membrane potential of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron in the final layer, achieves comparable Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a reference Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a photorealistic satellite dataset. Energy analysis shows that while hardware-agnostic methods predict a consistent 50-60% energy advantage for SNNs over CNNs, hardware-aware analysis reveals that significant energy savings are realized only on neuromorphic hardware and with high input sparsity. The influence of dark pixel ratio on energy consumption is quantified, emphasizing the impact of data characteristics and hardware assumptions. These findings highlight the need for transparent evaluation methods and explicit disclosure of underlying assumptions to ensure fair comparisons of neural network energy efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying things that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they skip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because most post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching and supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without explicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often learn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To mitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human annotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human annotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot adapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method that improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions via reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two stages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted to produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the question without referring back the input image. To validate this self-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language reasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This self-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced training signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning, mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts across diverse vision-language tasks.

  AI tasks in the car interior like identifying and localizing externally introduced objects is crucial for response quality of personal assistants. However, computational resources of on-board systems remain highly constrained, restricting the deployment of such solutions directly within the vehicle. To address this limitation, we propose the novel Object Detection and Localization (ODAL) framework for interior scene understanding. Our approach leverages vision foundation models through a distributed architecture, splitting computational tasks between on-board and cloud. This design overcomes the resource constraints of running foundation models directly in the car. To benchmark model performance, we introduce ODALbench, a new metric for comprehensive assessment of detection andthis http URLanalysis demonstrates the framework's potential to establish new standards in this domain. We compare the state-of-the-art GPT-4o vision foundation model with the lightweight LLaVA 1.5 7B model and explore how fine-tuning enhances the lightweight models performance. Remarkably, our fine-tuned ODAL-LLaVA model achieves an ODAL$_{score}$ of 89%, representing a 71% improvement over its baseline performance and outperforming GPT-4o by nearly 20%. Furthermore, the fine-tuned model maintains high detection accuracy while significantly reducing hallucinations, achieving an ODAL$_{SNR}$ three times higher than GPT-4o.

  Large video language models (LVLMs) have made notable progress in video understanding, spurring the development of corresponding evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Further analyses on context length, context variation, and model scale provide actionable insights for mitigating bias and guiding model enhancement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image denoising is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with applications in photography and medical imaging. While deep learning-based methods have shown remarkable success, their reliance on specific noise distributions limits generalization to unseen noise types and levels. Existing approaches attempt to address this with extensive training data and high computational resources but they still suffer from overfitting. To address these issues, we conduct image denoising by utilizing dynamically generated kernels via efficient operations. This approach helps prevent overfitting and improves resilience to unseen noise. Specifically, our method leverages a Feature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features, Global Statistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture comprehensive noise characteristics and structural correlations. The Kernel Prediction Module then employs these cues to produce pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local structures, which are then applied iteratively for denoising. This ensures both efficiency and superior restoration quality. Despite being trained on single-level Gaussian noise, our compact model (~ 0.04 M) excels across diverse noise types and levels, demonstrating the promise of iterative dynamic filtering for practical image denoising.

  Fine-grained action localization in untrimmed sports videos presents a significant challenge due to rapid and subtle motion transitions over short durations. Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collaborative perception allows agents to enhance their perceptual capabilities by exchanging intermediate features. Existing methods typically organize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues essential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we first introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for collaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered, massive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and aligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural information. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception framework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a point-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence modeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering module generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and token-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model captures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral domains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background clutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop process, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level refinement to mitigate localization noise. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with even lower communication and computation overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-tailed visual recognition is challenging not only due to class imbalance but also because of varying classification difficulty across categories. Simply reweighting classes by frequency often overlooks those that are intrinsically hard to learn. To address this, we propose \textbf{DQRoute}, a modular framework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert collaboration. DQRoute first estimates class-wise difficulty based on prediction uncertainty and historical performance, and uses this signal to guide training with adaptive loss weighting. On the architectural side, DQRoute employs a mixture-of-experts design, where each expert specializes in a different region of the class distribution. At inference time, expert predictions are weighted by confidence scores derived from expert-specific OOD detectors, enabling input-adaptive routing without the need for a centralized router. All components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate that DQRoute significantly improves performance, particularly on rare and difficult classes, highlighting the benefit of integrating difficulty modeling with decentralized expert routing.

  Skin images from real-world clinical practice are often limited, resulting in a shortage of training data for deep-learning models. While many studies have explored skin image synthesis, existing methods often generate low-quality images and lack control over the lesion's location and type. To address these limitations, we present LF-VAR, a model leveraging quantified lesion measurement scores and lesion type labels to guide the clinically relevant and controllable synthesis of skin images. It enables controlled skin synthesis with specific lesion characteristics based on language prompts. We train a multiscale lesion-focused Vector Quantised Variational Auto-Encoder (VQVAE) to encode images into discrete latent representations for structured tokenization. Then, a Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) Transformer trained on tokenized representations facilitates image synthesis. Lesion measurement from the lesion region and types as conditional embeddings are integrated to enhance synthesis fidelity. Our method achieves the best overall FID score (average 0.74) among seven lesion types, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 6.3%. The study highlights our controllable skin synthesis model's effectiveness in generating high-fidelity, clinically relevant synthetic skin images. Our framework code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model using labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust generalization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to improve generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data generated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often contain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training segmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation and error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse evolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using Laplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable generative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced diffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality images. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs can also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation. Based on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and propose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain scenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across scales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module, which performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of multi-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior generalization performance compared to existing methods.

  Post-training quantization (PTQ) is crucial for deploying efficient object detection models, like YOLO, on resource-constrained devices. However, the impact of reduced precision on model robustness to real-world input degradations such as noise, blur, and compression artifacts is a significant concern. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the robustness of YOLO models (nano to extra-large scales) across multiple precision formats: FP32, FP16 (TensorRT), Dynamic UINT8 (ONNX), and Static INT8 (TensorRT). We introduce and evaluate a degradation-aware calibration strategy for Static INT8 PTQ, where the TensorRT calibration process is exposed to a mix of clean and synthetically degraded images. Models were benchmarked on the COCO dataset under seven distinct degradation conditions (including various types and levels of noise, blur, low contrast, and JPEG compression) and a mixed-degradation scenario. Results indicate that while Static INT8 TensorRT engines offer substantial speedups (~1.5-3.3x) with a moderate accuracy drop (~3-7% mAP50-95) on clean data, the proposed degradation-aware calibration did not yield consistent, broad improvements in robustness over standard clean-data calibration across most models and degradations. A notable exception was observed for larger model scales under specific noise conditions, suggesting model capacity may influence the efficacy of this calibration approach. These findings highlight the challenges in enhancing PTQ robustness and provide insights for deploying quantized detectors in uncontrolled environments.

  Monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) is a fundamental computer vision task that estimates an object's class, 3D position, dimensions, and orientation from a single image. Its applications, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and robotics, critically rely on accurate 3D environmental understanding. This thesis addresses the challenge of generalizing Mono3D models to diverse scenarios, including occlusions, datasets, object sizes, and camera parameters. To enhance occlusion robustness, we propose a mathematically differentiable NMS (GrooMeD-NMS). To improve generalization to new datasets, we explore depth equivariant (DEVIANT) backbones. We address the issue of large object detection, demonstrating that it's not solely a data imbalance or receptive field problem but also a noise sensitivity issue. To mitigate this, we introduce a segmentation-based approach in bird's-eye view with dice loss (SeaBird). Finally, we mathematically analyze the extrapolation of Mono3D models to unseen camera heights and improve Mono3D generalization in such out-of-distribution settings.

  Diffusion models have gained prominence as state-of-the-art techniques for synthesizing images and videos, particularly due to their ability to scale effectively with large datasets. Recent studies have uncovered that these extensive datasets often contain mistakes from manual labeling processes. However, the extent to which such errors compromise the generative capabilities and controllability of diffusion models is not well studied. This paper introduces Score-based Discriminator Correction (SBDC), a guidance technique for aligning noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models. The guidance is built on discriminator training using adversarial loss, drawing on prior noise detection techniques to assess the authenticity of each sample. We further show that limiting the usage of our guidance to the early phase of the generation process leads to better performance. Our method is computationally efficient, only marginally increases inference time, and does not require retraining diffusion models. Experiments on different noise settings demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.

  Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising technology for next-generation displays. However, generating high-speed, high-quality holographic video requires both high frame rate display and efficient computation, but is constrained by two key limitations: ($i$) Learning-based models often produce over-smoothed phases with narrow angular spectra, causing severe color crosstalk in high frame rate full-color displays such as depth-division multiplexing and thus resulting in a trade-off between frame rate and color fidelity. ($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods typically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal correlations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally inefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase distributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color display at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without compromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color holographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due to ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization (e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on perturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult to capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex pathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel segmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a multimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of MPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes and pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing supervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine supervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on unlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into segmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary modeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture (TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained foundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of pathology-relevant features.

  _Luhu Li, Bowen Lin, Mukhtiar Khan, Shujun Fu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to limited annotations and a domain gap compared to natural images. Existing reconstruction methods often rely on frozen pre-trained encoders, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and reduces localization accuracy. Prototype-based learning offers interpretability and clustering benefits but suffers from prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, harming diversity and generalization. To address this, we propose a unified framework combining a trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and a novel Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss. The trainable encoder, enhanced by a momentum branch, enables stable domain-adaptive feature learning. A lightweight Prototype Extractor mines informative normal prototypes to guide the decoder via attention for precise reconstruction. Our loss enforces balanced prototype use through diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization, effectively preventing collapse. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization, outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype assignment analyses further validate the effectiveness of our anti-collapse mechanism and enhanced interpretability.

  _Yuhang Zhao, Zixing Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end object detectors offer a promising NMS-free paradigm for real-time applications, yet their high computational cost remains a significant barrier, particularly for complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring. To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems. The Intersection-Flow-5k dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents MonoRelief V2, an end-to-end model designed for directly recovering 2.5D reliefs from single images under complex material and illumination variations. In contrast to its predecessor, MonoRelief V1 [1], which was solely trained on synthetic data, MonoRelief V2 incorporates real data to achieve improved robustness, accuracy and efficiency. To overcome the challenge of acquiring large-scale real-world dataset, we generate approximately 15,000 pseudo real images using a text-to-image generative model, and derive corresponding depth pseudo-labels through fusion of depth and normal predictions. Furthermore, we construct a small-scale real-world dataset (800 samples) via multi-view reconstruction and detail refinement. MonoRelief V2 is then progressively trained on the pseudo-real and real-world datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance both in depth and normal predictions, highlighting its strong potential for a range of downstream applications.

  With advancements in AI, new gaze estimation methods are exceeding state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, but their real-world application reveals a gap with commercial eye-tracking solutions. Factors like model size, inference time, and privacy often go unaddressed. Meanwhile, webcam-based eye-tracking methods lack sufficient accuracy, in particular due to head movement. To tackle these issues, we introduce We bEyeTrack, a framework that integrates lightweight SOTA gaze estimation models directly in the browser. It incorporates model-based head pose estimation and on-device few-shot learning with as few as nine calibration samples (k < 9). WebEyeTrack adapts to new users, achieving SOTA performance with an error margin of 2.32 cm on GazeCapture and real-time inference speeds of 2.4 milliseconds on an iPhone 14.

  While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across multiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across dynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing multi-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generationthis http URLdata and evaluation code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion generation is essential for animating virtual characters and embodied agents. While recent text-driven methods have made significant strides, they often struggle with achieving precise alignment between linguistic descriptions and motion semantics, as well as with the inefficiencies of slow, multi-step inference. To address these issues, we introduce TMR++ Aligned Preference Optimization (TAPO), an innovative framework that aligns subtle motion variations with textual modifiers and incorporates iterative adjustments to reinforce semantic grounding. To further enable real-time synthesis, we propose MotionFLUX, a high-speed generation framework based on deterministic rectified flow matching. Unlike traditional diffusion models, which require hundreds of denoising steps, MotionFLUX constructs optimal transport paths between noise distributions and motion spaces, facilitating real-time synthesis. The linearized probability paths reduce the need for multi-step sampling typical of sequential methods, significantly accelerating inference time without sacrificing motion quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, together, TAPO and MotionFLUX form a unified system that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both semantic consistency and motion quality, while also accelerating generation speed. The code and pretrained models will be released.

  _Alzayat Saleh, Shunsuke Hatano, Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The automated management of invasive weeds is critical for sustainable agriculture, yet the performance of deep learning models in real-world fields is often compromised by two factors: challenging environmental conditions and the high cost of data annotation. This study tackles both issues through a diagnostic-driven, semi-supervised framework. Using a unique dataset of approximately 975 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled images of Guinea Grass in sugarcane, we first establish strong supervised baselines for classification (ResNet) and detection (YOLO, RF-DETR), achieving F1 scores up to 0.90 and mAP50 scores exceeding 0.82. Crucially, this foundational analysis, aided by interpretability tools, uncovered a pervasive "shadow bias," where models learned to misidentify shadows as vegetation. This diagnostic insight motivated our primary contribution: a semi-supervised pipeline that leverages unlabeled data to enhance model robustness. By training models on a more diverse set of visual information through pseudo-labeling, this framework not only helps mitigate the shadow bias but also provides a tangible boost in recall, a critical metric for minimizing weed escapes in automated spraying systems. To validate our methodology, we demonstrate its effectiveness in a low-data regime on a public crop-weed benchmark. Our work provides a clear and field-tested framework for developing, diagnosing, and improving robust computer vision systems for the complex realities of precision agriculture.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Origin-Destination (OD) flow matrices are essential for urban mobility analysis, underpinning applications in traffic forecasting, infrastructure planning, and policy design. However, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) reliance on auxiliary features (e.g., Points of Interest, socioeconomic statistics) that are costly to collect and have limited spatial coverage; and (2) sensitivity to spatial topology, where minor index reordering of urban regions (e.g., census tract relabeling) disrupts structural coherence in generated flows. To address these challenges, we propose Sat2Flow, a latent structure-aware diffusion-based framework that generates structurally coherent OD flows using solely satellite imagery as input. Our approach introduces a multi-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and employs a permutation-aware diffusion process that aligns latent representations across different regional orderings. Through a joint contrastive training objective that bridges satellite-derived features with OD patterns, combined with equivariant diffusion training that enforces structural consistency, Sat2Flow ensures topological robustness under arbitrary regional reindexing. Experimental results on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that Sat2Flow outperforms both physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy while preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index permutations. Sat2Flow offers a globally scalable solution for OD flow generation in data-scarce urban environments, eliminating region-specific auxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural invariance for robust mobility modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the era of deep learning, the increasing number of pre-trained models available online presents a wealth of knowledge. These models, developed with diverse architectures and trained on varied datasets for different tasks, provide unique interpretations of the real world. Their collective consensus is likely universal and generalizable to unseen data. However, effectively harnessing this collective knowledge poses a fundamental challenge due to the heterogeneity of pre-trained models. Existing knowledge integration solutions typically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and network architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of models and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a diverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such constraints. Specifically, we propose a dedicated voting mechanism to capture the consensus of knowledge both at the logit level -- incorporating teacher models that are capable of predicting target classes of interest -- and at the feature level, utilizing visual representations learned on arbitrary label spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIFORM effectively enhances unsupervised object recognition performance compared to strong knowledge transfer baselines. Notably, it exhibits remarkable scalability by benefiting from over one hundred teachers, while existing methods saturate at a much smaller scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gas leaks pose serious threats to human health and contribute significantly to atmospheric pollution, drawing increasing public concern. However, the lack of effective detection methods hampers timely and accurate identification of gas leaks. While some vision-based techniques leverage infrared videos for leak detection, the blurry and non-rigid nature of gas clouds often limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Joint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), which integrates the complementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to enhance gas leak representation and segmentation. Recognizing that gas leaks are sporadic and many video frames may contain no leak at all, our method incorporates a post-processing step to reduce false positives caused by noise and non-target objects, an issue that affects many existing approaches. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse scenarios show that JVLGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods. We evaluate our model under both supervised and few-shot learning settings, and it consistently achieves strong performance in both, whereas competing methods tend to perform well in only one setting or poorly in both.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study aimed to: (1) understand whether commercially available computer-vision and artificial intelligence (AI) player tracking software can accurately measure player position, speed and distance using broadcast footage and (2) determine the impact of camera feed and resolution on accuracy. Data were obtained from one match at the 2022 Qatar Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. Tactical, programme and camera 1 feeds were used. Three commercial tracking providers that use computer-vision and AI participated. Providers analysed instantaneous position (x, y coordinates) and speed (m\,s^{-1}) of each player. Their data were compared with a high-definition multi-camera tracking system (TRACAB Gen 5). Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias were calculated. Position RMSE ranged from 1.68 to 16.39 m, while speed RMSE ranged from 0.34 to 2.38 m\,s^{-1}. Total match distance mean bias ranged from -1745 m (-21.8%) to 1945 m (24.3%) across providers. Computer-vision and AI player tracking software offer the ability to track players with fair precision when players are detected by the software. Providers should use a tactical feed when tracking position and speed, which will maximise player detection, improving accuracy. Both 720p and 1080p resolutions are suitable, assuming appropriate computer-vision and AI models are implemented.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders worldwide. As it progresses, it leads to the deterioration of cognitive functions. Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for managing its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an intermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with AD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's disease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle differences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose EffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI images. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our approach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in a more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the model's clinical reliability. Furthermore, fine-tuning large pretrained models often yields suboptimal results when source and target dataset domains differ. To address this, we incorporate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to effectively adapt the pretrained ViT model to our target domain. This method enables efficient knowledge transfer and reduces the risk of overfitting. Our model achieves a classification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three diagnostic categories: AD, MCI, and CN for full ADNI dataset.

  Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains a central challenge in cardiovascular prognosis. We present PRISM (Prompt-guided Representation Integration for Survival Modeling), a self-supervised framework that integrates visual representations from non-contrast cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging with structured electronic health records (EHRs) for survival analysis. PRISM extracts temporally synchronized imaging features through motion-aware multi-view distillation and modulates them using medically informed textual prompts to enable fine-grained risk prediction. Across four independent clinical cohorts, PRISM consistently surpasses classical survival prediction models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning baselines under internal and external validation. Further clinical findings demonstrate that the combined imaging and EHR representations derived from PRISM provide valuable insights into cardiac risk across diverse cohorts. Three distinct imaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk are uncovered, including lateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, and anterior elevated focus during diastole. Prompt-guided attribution further identifies hypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant contributors among clinical and physiological EHR factors.

  Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy computational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.

  Accurate classification of terrestrial habitats is critical for biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and land-use planning. Several habitat classification schemes are in use, typically based on analysis of satellite imagery with validation by field ecologists. Here we present a methodology for classification of habitats based solely on ground-level imagery (photographs), offering improved validation and the ability to classify habitats at scale (for example using citizen-science imagery). In collaboration with Natural England, a public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England, this study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to ground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18 classes defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed using resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to balance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed and fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label to each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated strong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and F1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean F1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and Peat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or ambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of this approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily obtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based on such data have many potential applications. To support use by practitioners, we also provide a simple web application that classifies uploaded images using our model.

  Rice is a staple food of global importance in terms of trade, nutrition, and economic growth. Among Asian nations such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia are leading producers of both long and short grain varieties, including basmati, jasmine, arborio, ipsala, and kainat saila. To ensure consumer satisfaction and strengthen national reputations, monitoring rice crops and grain quality is essential. Manual inspection, however, is labour intensive, time consuming and error prone, highlighting the need for automated solutions for quality control and yield improvement. This study proposes an automated approach to classify five rice grain varieties using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A publicly available dataset of 75000 images was used for training and testing. Model evaluation employed accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Results demonstrated high classification accuracy with minimal misclassifications, confirming the model effectiveness in distinguishing rice varieties. In addition, an accurate diagnostic method for rice leaf diseases such as Brown Spot, Blast, Bacterial Blight, and Tungro was developed. The framework combined explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with deep learning models including CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Explainability techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) revealed how specific grain and leaf features influenced predictions, enhancing model transparency and reliability. The findings demonstrate the strong potential of deep learning in agricultural applications, paving the way for robust, interpretable systems that can support automated crop quality inspection and disease diagnosis, ultimately benefiting farmers, consumers, and the agricultural economy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatial representation learning is essential for GeoAI applications such as urban analytics, enabling the encoding of shapes, locations, and spatial relationships (topological and distance-based) of geo-entities like points, polylines, and polygons. Existing methods either target a single geo-entity type or, like Poly2Vec, decompose entities into simpler components to enable Fourier transformation, introducing high computational cost. Moreover, since the transformed space lacks geometric alignment, these methods rely on uniform, non-adaptive sampling, which blurs fine-grained features like edges and boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geo2Vec, a novel method inspired by signed distance fields (SDF) that operates directly in the original space. Geo2Vec adaptively samples points and encodes their signed distances (positive outside, negative inside), capturing geometry without decomposition. A neural network trained to approximate the SDF produces compact, geometry-aware, and unified representations for all geo-entity types. Additionally, we propose a rotation-invariant positional encoding to model high-frequency spatial variations and construct a structured and robust embedding space for downstream GeoAI models. Empirical results show that Geo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and achieving greater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications.

  Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various downstream tasks, including biometric face recognition (FR) with description. However, demographic biases remain a critical concern in FR, as these foundation models often fail to perform equitably across diverse demographic groups, considering ethnicity/race, gender, and age. Therefore, through our work DemoBias, we conduct an empirical evaluation to investigate the extent of demographic biases in LVLMs for biometric FR with textual token generation tasks. We fine-tuned and evaluated three widely used pre-trained LVLMs: LLaVA, BLIP-2, and PaliGemma on our own generated demographic-balanced dataset. We utilize several evaluation metrics, like group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate, to quantify and trace the performance disparities. The experimental results deliver compelling insights into the fairness and reliability of LVLMs across diverse demographic groups. Our empirical study uncovered demographic biases in LVLMs, with PaliGemma and LLaVA exhibiting higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, whereas BLIP-2 demonstrated comparably consistent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of large (visual) language models (LLM / LVLM) have led to a deluge of automated human-like systems in several domains including social media content generation, search and recommendation, healthcare prognosis, AI assistants for cognitive tasks etc. Although these systems have been successfully integrated in production; very little focus has been placed on sports, particularly accurate identification and natural language description of the game play. Most existing LLM/LVLMs can explain generic sports activities, but lack sufficient domain-centric sports' jargon to create natural (human-like) descriptions. This work highlights the limitations of existing SoTA LLM/LVLMs for generating production-grade sports captions from images in a desired stylized format, and proposes a two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline to address that. The proposed pipeline yields an improvement > 8-10% in the F1, and > 2-10% in BERT score compared to alternative approaches. In addition, it has a small runtime memory footprint and fast execution time. During Super Bowl LIX the pipeline proved its practical application for live professional sports journalism; generating highly accurate and stylized captions at the rate of 6 images per 3-5 seconds for over 1000 images during the game play.

  The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has revolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability, contextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based segmentation is essential for reliable perception in autonomous vehicles, yet modern segmentation networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety. Most existing defenses are designed for networks operating directly on raw 3D point clouds and rely on large, computationally intensive generative models. However, many state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation pipelines operate on more efficient 2D range view representations. Despite their widespread adoption, dedicated lightweight adversarial defenses for this domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce an efficient model-based purification framework tailored for adversarial defense in 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation. We propose a direct attack formulation in the range-view domain and develop an explainable purification network based on a mathematical justified optimization problem, achieving strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead. Our method achieves competitive performance on open benchmarks, consistently outperforming generative and adversarial training baselines. More importantly, real-world deployment on a demo vehicle demonstrates the framework's ability to deliver accurate operation in practical autonomous driving scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present an unsupervised slide-quality assessment pipeline that combines seven expert-inspired visual-design metrics (whitespace, colorfulness, edge density, brightness contrast, text density, color harmony, layout balance) with CLIP-ViT embeddings, using Isolation Forest-based anomaly scoring to evaluate presentation slides. Trained on 12k professional lecture slides and evaluated on six academic talks (115 slides), our method achieved Pearson correlations up to 0.83 with human visual-quality ratings-1.79x to 3.23x stronger than scores from leading vision-language models (ChatGPT o4-mini-high, ChatGPT o3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro). We demonstrate convergent validity with visual ratings, discriminant validity against speaker-delivery scores, and exploratory alignment with overall impressions. Our results show that augmenting low-level design cues with multimodal embeddings closely approximates audience perceptions of slide quality, enabling scalable, objective feedback in real time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

  _Jeonghwan Kim, Yushi Lan, Armando Fortes, Yongwei Chen, Xingang Pan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer. Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality, we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

  _Chunlin Zhong, Qiuxia Hou, Zhangjun Zhou, Shuang Hao, Haonan Lu, Yanhao Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2) Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance. Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2 Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research community advancements.

  _Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan, Md. Abrar Hasan, Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has been made available atthis https URL.

  _Weiyun Wang, Zhangwei Gao, Lixin Gu, Hengjun Pu, Long Cui, Xingguang Wei, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness, interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception. Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges (e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration, human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of compositional visual reasoning research.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition" directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be foundthis https URL.

  _Ruizhuo Song, Beiming Yuan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms, with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a ``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency $\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option, fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GeoSAM2, a prompt-controllable framework for 3D part segmentation that casts the task as multi-view 2D mask prediction. Given a textureless object, we render normal and point maps from predefined viewpoints and accept simple 2D prompts - clicks or boxes - to guide part selection. These prompts are processed by a shared SAM2 backbone augmented with LoRA and residual geometry fusion, enabling view-specific reasoning while preserving pretrained priors. The predicted masks are back-projected to the object and aggregated across views. Our method enables fine-grained, part-specific control without requiring text prompts, per-shape optimization, or full 3D labels. In contrast to global clustering or scale-based methods, prompts are explicit, spatially grounded, and interpretable. We achieve state-of-the-art class-agnostic performance on PartObjaverse-Tiny and PartNetE, outperforming both slow optimization-based pipelines and fast but coarse feedforward approaches. Our results highlight a new paradigm: aligning the paradigm of 3D segmentation with SAM2, leveraging interactive 2D inputs to unlock controllability and precision in object-level part understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for achieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks. Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks. Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage, modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results. Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner. Project page: \textcolor{brightpink}this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers. Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of modeling humans in the OR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework, which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g., CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

  _Shaoguang Wang, Ziyang Chen, Yijie Xu, Weiyu Guo, Hui Xiong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust 3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this, we propose a Robust single-stage fully Sparse 3D object Detection Network with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations. Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference, further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing LiDAR-Camera fusion methods have achieved strong results in 3D object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals, followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves strong performance across multiple categories and difficulty levels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene perception in vision-based systems such as autonomous driving. Prior work shows SDE is vulnerable to pixel-optimization attacks, but these methods are limited to digital, static, and view-specific settings, making them impractical. This raises a central question: how to design deployable, adaptive, and transferable attacks under realistic constraints? We present two contributions to answer it. First, we build a unified framework that extends pixel-optimization attacks to four stereo-matching stages: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost aggregation, and disparity regression. Through systematic evaluation across nine SDE models with realistic constraints like photometric consistency, we show existing attacks suffer from poor transferability. Second, we propose PatchHunter, the first pixel-optimization-free attack. PatchHunter casts patch generation as a search in a structured space of visual patterns that disrupt core SDE assumptions, and uses a reinforcement learning policy to discover effective and transferable patterns efficiently. We evaluate PatchHunter on three levels: autonomous driving dataset, high-fidelity simulator, and real-world deployment. On KITTI, PatchHunter outperforms pixel-level attacks in both effectiveness and black-box transferability. Tests in CARLA and on vehicles with industrial-grade stereo cameras confirm robustness to physical variations. Even under challenging conditions such as low lighting, PatchHunter achieves a D1-all error above 0.4, while pixel-level attacks remain near 0.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based place recognition serves as a crucial enabler for long-term autonomy in robotics and autonomous driving systems. Yet, prevailing methodologies relying on handcrafted feature extraction face dual challenges: (1) Inconsistent point cloud density, induced by ego-motion dynamics and environmental disturbances during repeated traversals, leads to descriptor instability, and (2) Representation fragility stems from reliance on single-level geometric abstractions that lack discriminative power in structurally complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that redefines 3D place recognition through density-agnostic geometric reasoning. Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization for historical maps, showcasing excellent Resilient and scalability. Our code will be open-sourced in the future.

  In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in audio-driven talking head generation have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization and emotional expression. However, they largely overlook the crucial task of facial attribute editing. This capability is indispensable for achieving deep personalization and expanding the range of practical applications, including user-tailored digital avatars, engaging online education content, and brand-specific digital customer service. In these key domains, flexible adjustment of visual attributes, such as hairstyle, accessories, and subtle facial features, is essential for aligning with user preferences, reflecting diverse brand identities and adapting to varying contextual demands. In this paper, we present FaceEditTalker, a unified framework that enables controllable facial attribute manipulation while generating high-quality, audio-synchronized talking head videos. Our method consists of two key components: an image feature space editing module, which extracts semantic and detail features and allows flexible control over attributes like expression, hairstyle, and accessories; and an audio-driven video generation module, which fuses these edited features with audio-guided facial landmarks to drive a diffusion-based generator. This design ensures temporal coherence, visual fidelity, and identity preservation across frames. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to representative baseline methods in lip-sync accuracy, video quality, and attribute controllability.

  _Pengfei Zhang, Shouqing Jia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) process images as a whole. Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and generate more realistic images. HDM essentially is a DDPM that incorporates an attention mechanism between pixels. In HDM, the discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR place recognition is a critical capability for autonomous navigation and cross-modal localization in large-scale outdoor environments. Existing approaches predominantly depend on pre-built 3D dense maps or aerial imagery, which impose significant storage overhead and lack real-time adaptability. In this paper, we propose OPAL, a novel framework for LiDAR place recognition that leverages OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a lightweight and up-to-date prior. Our key innovation lies in bridging the domain disparity between sparse LiDAR scans and structured OSM data through two carefully designed components. First, a cross-modal visibility mask that identifies observable regions from both modalities to guide feature alignment. Second, an adaptive radial fusion module that dynamically consolidates radial features into discriminative global descriptors. Extensive experiments on KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate OPAL's superiority, achieving 15.98% higher recall at 1m threshold for top-1 retrieved matches, along with 12x faster inference speed compared to the state-of-the-art approach.

  _Jaywon Koo, Jefferson Hernandez, Moayed Haji-Ali, Ziyan Yang, Vicente Ordonez_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating text-to-image and text-to-video models is challenging due to a fundamental disconnect: established metrics fail to jointly measure visual quality and semantic alignment with text, leading to a poor correlation with human judgments. To address this critical issue, we propose cFreD, a general metric based on a Conditional Fr√©chet Distance that unifies the assessment of visual fidelity and text-prompt consistency into a single score. Existing metrics such as Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) capture image quality but ignore text conditioning while alignment scores such as CLIPScore are insensitive to visual quality. Furthermore, learned preference models require constant retraining and are unlikely to generalize to novel architectures or out-of-distribution prompts. Through extensive experiments across multiple recently proposed text-to-image models and diverse prompt datasets, cFreD exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments compared to statistical metrics , including metrics trained with human preferences. Our findings validate cFreD as a robust, future-proof metric for the systematic evaluation of text conditioned models, standardizing benchmarking in this rapidly evolving field. We release our evaluation toolkit and benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Cross-Modality Generation Models (GMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hemodynamic parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress play an important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in cardiovascular diseases. These parameters can be accurately computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive. Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained. These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to difficult cases. Our results show that active learning is a feasible strategy to increase the potential of deep learning-based CFD surrogates.

  _Hongseok Oh, Wonseok Hwang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show remarkable performance across various domains. However, these models suffer from object hallucination. This study revisits the previous claim that the cause of such hallucinations lies in the limited representational capacity of the vision encoder. Our analysis implies that the capacity of the vision encoder is not necessarily a major limiting factor in detecting object hallucination. Based on this insight, we propose Fine-grained CLIPScore (F-CLIPScore), a simple yet effective evaluation metric that enhances object-level granularity by incorporating text embeddings at the noun level. Evaluations on the OHD-Caps benchmark show that F-CLIPScore significantly outperforms conventional CLIPScore in accuracy by a large margin of \textbf{39.6\%} without additional training. We further demonstrate that F-CLIPScore-based data filtering reduces object hallucination in LVLM (4.9\% in POPE).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models, but doing so requires approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the diffusion reverse process. We show that the approximations produced by existing methods are relatively poor, especially early in the reverse process, and so we propose a new approach that iteratively reestimates and "renoises" the estimate several times per diffusion step. This iterative approach, which we call Fast Iterative REnoising (FIRE), injects colored noise that is shaped to ensure that the pre-trained diffusion model always sees white noise, in accordance with how it was trained. We then embed FIRE into the DDIM reverse process and show that the resulting "DDfire" offers state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime on several linear inverse problems, as well as phase retrieval.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feature-based image matching has extensive applications in computer vision. Keypoints detected in images can be naturally represented as graph structures, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional deep learning techniques. Consequently, the paradigm of image matching via GNNs has gained significant prominence in recent academic research. In this paper, we first introduce an innovative adaptive graph construction method that utilizes a filtering mechanism based on distance and dynamic threshold similarity. This method dynamically adjusts the criteria for incorporating new vertices based on the characteristics of existing vertices, allowing for the construction of more precise and robust graph structures while avoiding redundancy. We further combine the vertex processing capabilities of GNNs with the global awareness capabilities of Transformers to enhance the model's representation of spatial and feature information within graph structures. This hybrid model provides a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between vertices and their contributions to the matching process. Additionally, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to iteratively solve for optimal matching results. Finally, we validate our system using extensive image datasets and conduct comprehensive comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves an average improvement of 3.8x-40.3x in overall matching performance. Additionally, the number of vertices and edges significantly impacts training efficiency and memory usage; therefore, we employ multi-GPU technology to accelerate the training process.

  _Peirong Zhang, Lianwen Jin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Currently, the prevalence of online handwriting has spurred a critical need for effective retrieval systems to accurately search relevant handwriting instances from specific writers, known as online writer retrieval. Despite the growing demand, this field suffers from a scarcity of well-established methodologies and public large-scale datasets. This paper tackles these challenges with a focus on Chinese handwritten phrases. First, we propose DOLPHIN, a novel retrieval model designed to enhance handwriting representations through synergistic temporal-frequency analysis. For frequency feature learning, we propose the HFGA block, which performs gated cross-attention between the vanilla temporal handwriting sequence and its high-frequency sub-bands to amplify salient writing details. For temporal feature learning, we propose the CAIR block, tailored to promote channel interaction and reduce channel redundancy. Second, to address data deficit, we introduce OLIWER, a large-scale online writer retrieval dataset encompassing over 670,000 Chinese handwritten phrases from 1,731 individuals. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of DOLPHIN over existing methods. In addition, we explore cross-domain writer retrieval and reveal the pivotal role of increasing feature alignment in bridging the distributional gap between different handwriting data. Our findings emphasize the significance of point sampling frequency and pressure features in improving handwriting representation quality and retrieval performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The analysis of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings represents a critical component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. However, manual analysis of these IEDs, which appear as epileptic spikes, from the large amount of MEG/EEG data is labor intensive and requires high expertise. Although automated methods have been developed to address this challenge, current approaches fail to fully emulate clinical experts' diagnostic intelligence in two key aspects: (1) their analysis on the input signals is limited to short temporal windows matching individual spike durations, missing the extended contextual patterns clinicians use to assess significance; and (2) they fail to adequately capture the dipole patterns with simultaneous positive-negative potential distributions across adjacent sensors that serve as clinicians' key diagnostic criterion for IED identification. To bridge this artificial-human intelligence gap, we propose a novel deep learning framework LV-CadeNet that integrates two key innovations: (1) a Long-View morphological feature representation that mimics expert clinicians' comprehensive assessment of both local spike characteristics and long-view contextual information, and (2) a hierarchical Encoder-Decoder NETwork that employs Convolution-Attention blocks for multi-scale spatiotemporal feature learning with progressive abstraction. Extensive evaluations confirm the superior performance of LV-CadeNet, which outperforms six state-of-the-art methods in EEG spike classification on TUEV, the largest public EEG spike dataset. Additionally, LV-CadeNet attains a significant improvement of 13.58% in balanced accuracy over the leading baseline for MEG spike detection on a clinical MEG dataset from Sanbo Brain Hospital, Capital Medical University.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in vision-language understanding. Recently, with the integration of test-time scaling techniques, these models have also shown strong potential in visual reasoning. However, most existing reasoning approaches remain text-level in nature: MLLMs are prompted to explore various combinations of textual tokens via their underlying language model, while the visual input remains fixed throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm limits the model's ability to fully exploit rich visual information, particularly when dealing with images containing numerous fine-grained elements. In such cases, vision-level reasoning becomes crucial - where models dynamically zoom into specific regions of the image to gather detailed visual cues necessary for accurate decision-making. In this paper, we propose Zoom Eye, a training-free, model-agnostic tree search algorithm tailored for vision-level reasoning. Zoom Eye treats an image as a hierarchical tree structure, where each child node represents a zoomed-in sub-region of its parent, and the root corresponds to the full image. The algorithm enables MLLMs to simulate human-like zooming behavior by navigating from root to leaf nodes in search of task-relevant visual evidence. We experiment on a series of high-resolution benchmarks and the results demonstrate that Zoom Eye consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs by a large margin (e.g., InternVL2.5-8B increases by 15.71% and 17.69% on HR-Bench) and also enables small 3-8B MLLMs to outperform strong large models such as GPT-4o.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent works utilize CLIP to perform the challenging unsupervised semantic segmentation task where only images without annotations are available. However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient single instance segmentation is essential for unlocking features in the mobile imaging applications, such as capture or editing. Existing on-the-fly mobile imaging applications scope the segmentation task to portraits or the salient subject due to the computational constraints. Instance segmentation, despite its recent developments towards efficient networks, is still heavy due to the cost of computation on the entire image to identify all instances. To address this, we propose and formulate a one tap driven single instance segmentation task that segments a single instance selected by a user via a positive tap. This task, in contrast to the broader task of segmenting anything as suggested in the Segment Anything Model \cite{sam}, focuses on efficient segmentation of a single instance specified by the user. To solve this problem, we present TraceNet, which explicitly locates the selected instance by way of receptive field tracing. TraceNet identifies image regions that are related to the user tap and heavy computations are only performed on selected regions of the image. Therefore overall computation cost and memory consumption are reduced during inference. We evaluate the performance of TraceNet on instance IoU average over taps and the proportion of the region that a user tap can fall into for a high-quality single-instance mask. Experimental results on MS-COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. TraceNet can jointly achieve the efficiency and interactivity, filling in the gap between needs for efficient mobile inference and recent research trend towards multimodal and interactive segmentation models.

  Traditional image-to-3D models often struggle with scenes containing multiple objects due to biases and occlusion complexities. To address this challenge, we present REPARO, a novel approach for compositional 3D asset generation from single images. REPARO employs a two-step process: first, it extracts individual objects from the scene and reconstructs their 3D meshes using off-the-shelf image-to-3D models; then, it optimizes the layout of these meshes through differentiable rendering techniques, ensuring coherent scene composition. By integrating optimal transport-based long-range appearance loss term and high-level semantic loss term in the differentiable rendering, REPARO can effectively recover the layout of 3D assets. The proposed method can significantly enhance object independence, detail accuracy, and overall scene coherence. Extensive evaluation of multi-object scenes demonstrates that our REPARO offers a comprehensive approach to address the complexities of multi-object 3D scene generation from single images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoencoders (AE) are simple yet powerful class of neural networks that compress data by projecting input into low-dimensional latent space (LS). Whereas LS is formed according to the loss function minimization during training, its properties and topology are not controlled directly. In this paper we focus on AE LS properties and propose two methods for obtaining LS with desired topology, called LS configuration. The proposed methods include loss configuration using a geometric loss term that acts directly in LS, and encoder configuration. We show that the former allows to reliably obtain LS with desired configuration by defining the positions and shapes of LS clusters for supervised AE (SAE). Knowing LS configuration allows to define similarity measure in LS to predict labels or estimate similarity for multiple inputs without using decoders or classifiers. We also show that this leads to more stable and interpretable training. We show that SAE trained for clothes texture classification using the proposed method generalizes well to unseen data from LIP, Market1501, and WildTrack datasets without fine-tuning, and even allows to evaluate similarity for unseen classes. We further illustrate the advantages of pre-configured LS similarity estimation with cross-dataset searches and text-based search using a text query without language models.

  Failure-Directed Search (FDS) is a significant complete generic search algorithm used in Constraint Programming (CP) to efficiently explore the search space, proven particularly effective on scheduling problems. This paper analyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree guided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning algorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and parameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best extended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original implementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the current state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore, using only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the existing state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP standard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of pre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii) layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2 sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v) reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning. Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that gradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers, whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic attacks.

  E-commerce marketplaces make use of a number of marketing channels like emails, push notifications, etc. to reach their users and stimulate purchases. Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of email titles for millions of users.

FairLoop distills decision trees from neural networks, allowing users to inspect and modify unfair decision logic, which is then used to fine-tune the original model towards fairer predictions. Compared to other approaches to fairness, FairLoop enables context-aware bias removal through human involvement, addressing the influence of sensitive attributes selectively rather than excluding them uniformly.

  Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.

To understand when and how this emergent misalignment occurs, we develop a comprehensive framework for detecting and characterizing rapid transitions during fine-tuning using both distributional change detection methods as well as order parameters that are formulated in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Using an objective statistical dissimilarity measure, we quantify how the phase transition that occurs during fine-tuning affects multiple aspects of the model. In particular, we assess what percentage of the total distributional change in model outputs is captured by different aspects, such as alignment or verbosity, providing a decomposition of the overall transition. We also find that the actual behavioral transition occurs later in training than indicated by the peak in the gradient norm alone. Our framework enables the automated discovery and quantification of language-based order parameters, which we demonstrate on examples ranging from knowledge questions to politics and ethics.

  This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than $\mathbf{1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to $\mathbf{37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by $\mathbf{11}\%$ on average.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose additional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each source of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Experiments are carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream supervised fine-tuning tasks.

  As language models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in high-stakes settings, ensuring that they reliably follow user-defined rules has become a critical safety concern. To this end, we study whether language models exhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent safety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval) that measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user request is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current open- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and that, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve performance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak confidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces should be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty of our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure through various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn conversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our results suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling confidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be trained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes settings.

  In dense metropolitan areas, searching for street parking adds to traffic congestion. Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile phones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work quantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability through such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street parking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem, we analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn), coordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized oracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our novel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior probabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of how close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to navigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical distances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a Hungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity simulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of Cord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes for non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx reduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs, and up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.

  This study presents a machine learning framework for forecasting short-term faults in industrial centrifugal pumps using real-time sensor data. The approach aims to predict {EarlyWarning} conditions 5, 15, and 30 minutes in advance based on patterns extracted from historical operation. Two lookback periods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window approach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class imbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm. Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were trained and tested on the labeled dataset. Results show that the Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance with a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\% at 15 minutes, and 48.6\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random Forest model achieved 57.6\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive accuracy of 65.6\% at both 15 and 30 minutes. XGBoost displayed similar but slightly lower performance. These findings highlight that optimal history length depends on the prediction horizon, and that different fault patterns may evolve at different timescales. The proposed method offers an interpretable and scalable solution for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time industrial monitoring systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Network traffic classification using pre-training models has shown promising results, but existing methods struggle to capture packet structural characteristics, flow-level behaviors, hierarchical protocol semantics, and inter-packet contextual relationships. To address these challenges, we propose FlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for network traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware Traffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically meaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture multilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining Tasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification accuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively integrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better comprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful connections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for traffic analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented learning based on radiology reports has emerged as a promising direction to improve performance on long-tail medical imaging tasks, such as rare disease detection in chest X-rays. Most existing methods rely on comparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT, which are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not well-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a novel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based on clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text reports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These entities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent, interpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a task-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of the Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical relationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically meaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a radiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail settings. Additionally, we use our pipeline to generate ontology-backed disease labels for MIMIC-CXR, offering a valuable new resource for downstream learning tasks. Our work provides more explainable, reliable, and task-specific retrieval strategies in clinical AI systems, especially when interpretability and domain knowledge integration are essential.

  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables learning effective policies from fixed datasets without any environment interaction. Existing methods typically employ policy constraints to mitigate the distribution shift encountered during offline RL training. However, because the scale of the constraints varies across tasks and datasets of differing quality, existing methods must meticulously tune hyperparameters to match each dataset, which is time-consuming and often impractical. We propose Adaptive Scaling of Policy Constraints (ASPC), a second-order differentiable framework that dynamically balances RL and behavior cloning (BC) during training. We theoretically analyze its performance improvement guarantee. In experiments on 39 datasets across four D4RL domains, ASPC using a single hyperparameter configuration outperforms other adaptive constraint methods and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms that require per-dataset tuning while incurring only minimal computational overhead. The code will be released atthis https URL.

  _Davorin Miliƒçeviƒá, Ratko Grbiƒá_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often rely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to overfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates neuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1 extends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy objective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser that aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding convolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and (ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style consolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the network. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss, explicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins in the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet across five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2, DenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other methods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp (CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and filter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and selective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters. Overall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields CNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering practical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in structured data modeling tasks such as node classification. However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning.

  _Erdi Kara, Panos Stinis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a hybrid framework that couples finite element methods (FEM) with physics-informed DeepONet to model fluid transport in porous media from sharp, localized Gaussian sources. The governing system consists of a steady-state Darcy flow equation and a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our approach solves the Darcy system using FEM and transfers the resulting velocity field to a physics-informed DeepONet, which learns the mapping from source functions to solute concentration profiles. This modular strategy preserves FEM-level accuracy in the flow field while enabling fast inference for transport dynamics. To handle steep gradients induced by sharp sources, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy for trunk collocation points. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is in good agreement with the reference solutions while offering orders of magnitude speedups over traditional solvers, making it suitable for practical applications in relevant scenarios. Implementation of our proposed method is available atthis https URL.

  We propose a new symplectic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture by leveraging symplectic neural networks, proper symplectic decomposition, and tensor techniques. Specifically, we first introduce a mathematically equivalent form of the convolution layer and then, using symplectic neural networks, we demonstrate a way to parameterize the layers of the CNN to ensure that the convolution layer remains symplectic. To construct a complete autoencoder, we introduce a symplectic pooling layer. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed neural network on three examples: the wave equation, the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger (NLS) equation, and the sine-Gordon equation. The numerical results indicate that the symplectic CNN outperforms the linear symplectic autoencoder obtained via proper symplectic decomposition.

  Model merging has emerged as an efficient strategy for constructing multitask models by integrating the strengths of multiple available expert models, thereby reducing the need to fine-tune a pre-trained model for all the tasks from scratch. Existing data-independent methods struggle with performance limitations due to the lack of data-driven guidance. Data-driven approaches also face key challenges: gradient-based methods are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for merging large expert models, whereas existing gradient-free methods often fail to achieve satisfactory results within a limited number of optimization steps. To address these limitations, this paper introduces PSO-Merging, a novel data-driven merging method based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this approach, we initialize the particle swarm with a pre-trained model, expert models, and sparsified expert models. We then perform multiple iterations, with the final global best particle serving as the merged model. Experimental results on different language models show that PSO-Merging generally outperforms baseline merging methods, offering a more efficient and scalable solution for model merging.

  Simulating granular media, using Discrete Element Method is a computationally intensive task. This is especially true during initialization phase, which dominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and associated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative pipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily large granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic configurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling task, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to generate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D inpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs, stitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples with physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several masking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the network to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised tensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a 2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground truth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted losses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both models are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from small-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time with respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track synthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20 seconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain geometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent, real-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.

  The Adam optimizer remains one of the most widely used optimizers in deep learning, and effectively tuning its hyperparameters is key to optimizing performance. However, tuning can be tedious and costly. Freeze-thaw Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a recent promising approach for low-budget hyperparameter tuning, but is limited by generic surrogates without prior knowledge of how hyperparameters affect learning. We propose Adam-PFN, a new surrogate model for Freeze-thaw BO of Adam's hyperparameters, pre-trained on learning curves from TaskSet, together with a new learning curve augmentation method, CDF-augment, which artificially increases the number of available training examples. Our approach improves both learning curve extrapolation and accelerates hyperparameter optimization on TaskSet evaluation tasks, with strong performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.

  Foundation models exhibit remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, largely driven by the characteristics of their training data. Recent data-centric methods like pruning and compression aim to optimize training but offer limited theoretical insight into how data properties affect generalization, especially the data characteristics in sample scaling. Traditional perspectives further constrain progress by focusing predominantly on data quantity and training efficiency, often overlooking structural aspects of data quality. In this study, we introduce SCAR, a principled scheme for characterizing the intrinsic structural properties of datasets across four key measures: Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. Unlike prior data-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain invariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for data understanding. Leveraging these structural properties, we introduce Foundation Data-a minimal subset that preserves the generalization behavior of the full dataset without requiring model-specific retraining. We model single-modality tasks as step functions and estimate the distribution of the foundation data size to capture step-wise generalization bias across modalities in the target multi-modal dataset. Finally, we develop a SCAR-guided data completion strategy based on this generalization bias, which enables efficient, modality-aware expansion of modality-specific characteristics in multimodal datasets. Experiments across diverse multi-modal datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and guiding data acquisition. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed clients without disclosing their raw data. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has gained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity. However, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a single distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each client. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may possess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant intra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework based on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt generation from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an implicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a variational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that pFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature and label heterogeneity settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating model accuracy on unseen, unlabeled datasets is crucial for real-world machine learning applications, especially under distribution shifts that can degrade performance. Existing methods often rely on predicted class probabilities (softmax scores) or data similarity metrics. While softmax-based approaches benefit from representing predictions on the standard simplex, compressing logits into probabilities leads to information loss. Meanwhile, similarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific, limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors in Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves richer information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on theoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the aggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the predictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an anchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in logit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle variations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate performance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's superiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines. Notably, ALSA's robustness under significant distribution shifts highlights its potential as a practical tool for reliable model evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The functionality of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is primarily determined by two capabilities: action planning and answer summarization. The former, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's performance. However, prevailing training paradigms employ end-to-end, multi-objective optimization that jointly trains both capabilities. This paradigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective allocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the agent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that decouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective optimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal based on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool invocation sequences. This method offers a more direct and reliable training signal than assessing the final response content, thereby obviating the need for verifiable data. Our experiments demonstrate that RLTR achieves an 8%-12% improvement in planning performance compared to end-to-end baselines. Moreover, this enhanced planning capability, in turn, translates to a 5%-6% increase in the final response quality of the overall agent system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial intelligence underpins most smart city services, yet deep neural network (DNN) that forecasts vehicle motion still struggle with catastrophic forgetting, the loss of earlier knowledge when models are updated. Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model updates (new hyperparameters, kernels, depths, solvers, or data) change performance, but the \emph{reason} often remains opaque. We introduce \textbf{Delta-Attribution} (\mbox{$\Delta$-Attribution}), a model-agnostic framework that explains \emph{what changed} between versions $A$ and $B$ by differencing per-feature attributions: $\Delta\phi(x)=\phi_B(x)-\phi_A(x)$. We evaluate $\Delta\phi$ with a \emph{$\Delta$-Attribution Quality Suite} covering magnitude/sparsity (L1, Top-$k$, entropy), agreement/shift (rank-overlap@10, Jensen--Shannon divergence), behavioural alignment (Delta Conservation Error, DCE; Behaviour--Attribution Coupling, BAC; CO$\Delta$F), and robustness (noise, baseline sensitivity, grouped occlusion).Instantiated via fast occlusion/clamping in standardized space with a class-anchored margin and baseline averaging, we audit 45 settings: five classical families (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, $k$NN), three datasets (Breast Cancer, Wine, Digits), and three A/B pairs per family. \textbf{Findings.} Inductive-bias changes yield large, behaviour-aligned deltas (e.g., SVC poly$\!\rightarrow$rbf on Breast Cancer: BAC$\approx$0.998, DCE$\approx$6.6; Random Forest feature-rule swap on Digits: BAC$\approx$0.997, DCE$\approx$7.5), while ``cosmetic'' tweaks (SVC \texttt{gamma=scale} vs.\ \texttt{auto}, $k$NN search) show rank-overlap@10$=1.0$ and DCE$\approx$0. The largest redistribution appears for deeper GB on Breast Cancer (JSD$\approx$0.357). $\Delta$-Attribution offers a lightweight update audit that complements accuracy by distinguishing benign changes from behaviourally meaningful or risky reliance shifts.

Recent continual learning (CL) studies aim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the ability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory stability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to acquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity dilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal (SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory buffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs an inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the memory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is designed to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory buffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based on an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted memory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this memory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate SyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios arrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets from INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while improving forecasting accuracy in new ones. The implementation is publicly available atthis https URL.

  In reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), reward models can efficiently learn and amplify latent biases within multimodal datasets, which can lead to imperfect policy optimization through flawed reward signals and decreased fairness. Bias mitigation studies have often applied passive constraints, which can fail under causal confounding. Here, we present a counterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal representation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward signal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an aggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that decompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction uncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of fairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts aligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal fake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance, and distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift detection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness benchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across sequential batches to test robustness. The resulting system achieved an accuracy of 89.12% in fake news detection, outperforming the baseline reward models. More importantly, it reduced spurious correlations and unfair reinforcement signals. This pipeline outlines a robust and interpretable approach to fairness-aware RLHF, offering tunable bias reduction thresholds and increasing reliability in dynamic real-time policy making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with limited data presents significant challenges for generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has proven effective in improving generalization by seeking flat minima, its substantial extra memory and computation overhead make it impractical for large models. Integrating SAM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a promising direction. However, we find that directly applying SAM to LoRA parameters limits the sharpness optimization to a restricted subspace, hindering its effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA), which introduces an auxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's adversarial weight perturbations. It decouples SAM's weight perturbations from LoRA optimization: the primary LoRA module adapts to specific tasks via standard gradient descent, while the auxiliary module captures the sharpness of the loss landscape through gradient ascent. Such dual-module design enables Bi-LoRA to capture broader sharpness for achieving flatter minima while remaining memory-efficient. Another important benefit is that the dual design allows for simultaneous optimization and perturbation, eliminating SAM's doubled training costs. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and architectures demonstrate Bi-LoRA's efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization.

  Modern mobility platforms have stored vast streams of GPS trajectories, temporal metadata, free-form textual notes, and other unstructured data. Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time, constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint, guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy, and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.

  We present a generative optimization approach for learning game-playing agents, where policies are represented as Python programs and refined using large language models (LLMs). Our method treats decision-making policies as self-evolving code, with current observation as input and an in-game action as output, enabling agents to self-improve through execution traces and natural language feedback with minimal human intervention. Applied to Atari games, our game-playing Python program achieves performance competitive with deep reinforcement learning (RL) baselines while using significantly less training time and much fewer environment interactions. This work highlights the promise of programmatic policy representations for building efficient, adaptable agents capable of complex, long-horizon reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discovering interpretable mathematical equations from observed data (a.k.a. equation discovery or symbolic regression) is a cornerstone of scientific discovery, enabling transparent modeling of physical, biological, and economic systems. While foundation models pre-trained on large-scale equation datasets offer a promising starting point, they often suffer from negative transfer and poor generalization when applied to small, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we introduce EQUATE (Equation Generation via QUality-Aligned Transfer Embeddings), a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts foundation models for symbolic equation discovery in low-data regimes via distillation. EQUATE combines symbolic-numeric alignment with evaluator-guided embedding optimization, enabling a principled embedding-search-generation paradigm. Our approach reformulates discrete equation search as a continuous optimization task in a shared embedding space, guided by data-equation fitness and simplicity. Experiments across three standard public benchmarks (Feynman, Strogatz, and black-box datasets) demonstrate that EQUATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while preserving low complexity and fast inference. These results highlight EQUATE as a practical and generalizable solution for data-efficient symbolic regression in foundation model distillation settings.

  Tabular learning transforms raw features into optimized spaces for downstream tasks, but its effectiveness deteriorates under distribution shifts between training and testing data. We formalize this challenge as the Distribution Shift Tabular Learning (DSTL) problem and propose a novel Shift-Aware Feature Transformation (SAFT) framework to address it. SAFT reframes tabular learning from a discrete search task into a continuous representation-generation paradigm, enabling differentiable optimization over transformed feature sets. SAFT integrates three mechanisms to ensure robustness: (i) shift-resistant representation via embedding decorrelation and sample reweighting, (ii) flatness-aware generation through suboptimal embedding averaging, and (iii) normalization-based alignment between training and test distributions. Extensive experiments show that SAFT consistently outperforms prior tabular learning methods in terms of robustness, effectiveness, and generalization ability under diverse real-world distribution shifts.

  We study incentivized exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB) settings with infinitely many arms modeled as elements in continuous metric spaces. Unlike classical bandit models, we consider scenarios where the decision-maker (principal) incentivizes myopic agents to explore beyond their greedy choices through compensation, but with the complication of reward drift--biased feedback arising due to the incentives. We propose novel incentivized exploration algorithms that discretize the infinite arm space uniformly and demonstrate that these algorithms simultaneously achieve sublinear cumulative regret and sublinear total compensation. Specifically, we derive regret and compensation bounds of $\Tilde{O}(T^{d+1/d+2})$, with $d$ representing the covering dimension of the metric space. Furthermore, we generalize our results to contextual bandits, achieving comparable performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.

  Producing large complex simulation datasets can often be a time and resource consuming task. Especially when these experiments are very expensive, it is becoming more reasonable to generate synthetic data for downstream tasks. Recently, these methods may include using generative machine learning models such as Generative Adversarial Networks or diffusion models. As these generative models improve efficiency in producing useful data, we introduce an internal tensor decomposition to these generative models to even further reduce costs. More specifically, for multidimensional data, or tensors, we generate the smaller tensor factors instead of the full tensor, in order to significantly reduce the model's output and overall parameters. This reduces the costs of generating complex simulation data, and our experiments show the generated data remains useful. As a result, tensor decomposition has the potential to improve efficiency in generative models, especially when generating multidimensional data, or tensors.

  Motivation. Understanding the pan-cancer mutational landscape offers critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. While patient-level machine learning techniques have been widely employed to identify tumor subtypes, cohort-level clustering, where entire cancer types are grouped based on shared molecular features, has largely relied on classical statistical methods.Results. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework to cluster 43 cancer types based on coding mutation data derived from the COSMIC database. For each cancer type, we construct two complementary mutation signatures: a gene-level profile capturing nucleotide substitution patterns across the most frequently mutated genes, and a chromosome-level profile representing normalized substitution frequencies across chromosomes. These dual views are encoded using TabNet encoders and optimized via a multi-scale contrastive learning objective (NT-Xent loss) to learn unified cancer-type embeddings. We demonstrate that the resulting latent representations yield biologically meaningful clusters of cancer types, aligning with known mutational processes and tissue origins. Our work represents the first application of contrastive learning to cohort-level cancer clustering, offering a scalable and interpretable framework for mutation-driven cancer subtyping.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate subsurface reservoir pressure control is extremely challenging due to geological heterogeneity and multiphase fluid-flow dynamics. Predicting behavior in this setting relies on high-fidelity physics-based simulations that are computationally expensive. Yet, the uncertain, heterogeneous properties that control these flows make it necessary to perform many of these expensive simulations, which is often prohibitive. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-informed machine learning workflow that couples a fully differentiable multiphase flow simulator, which is implemented in the DPFEHM framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN learns to predict fluid extraction rates from heterogeneous permeability fields to enforce pressure limits at critical reservoir locations. By incorporating transient multiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more practical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios compare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on single-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase scenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate that high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand full-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates requiring up to ten million. This drastic reduction in the number of simulations is achieved by leveraging transfer learning from much less expensive single-phase simulations.

  We present a mechanistic case study of a format-dependent reasoning failure in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, where the model incorrectly judges "9.11" as larger than "9.8" in chat or Q&A formats, but answers correctly in simple format. Through systematic intervention, we discover transformers implement even/odd attention head specialization: even indexed heads handle numerical comparison, while odd heads serve incompatible functions. The bug requires exactly 8 even heads at Layer 10 for perfect repair. Any combination of 8+ even heads succeeds, while 7 or fewer completely fails, revealing sharp computational thresholds with perfect redundancy among the 16 even heads. SAE analysis reveals the mechanism: format representations separate (10% feature overlap at Layer 7), then re-entangle with different weightings (80% feature overlap at Layer 10), with specific features showing 1.5x amplification in failing formats. We achieve perfect repair using only 25% of attention heads and identify a 60% pattern replacement threshold, demonstrating that apparent full-module requirements hide sophisticated substructure with implications for interpretability and efficiency.

  _Supratik Sarkar, Swagatam Das_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications. While AF detection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage progression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its sudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into sustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early prediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through preventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In this study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR Intervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for positional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early prediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise testing results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of 0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our method demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand parameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and model compactness. Notably, the model can predict AF up to two hours in advance using just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough lead time for preventive interventions.

  While transfer learning is an advantageous strategy, it overlooks the opportunity to leverage knowledge from numerous available models online. Addressing this multi-source transfer learning problem is a promising path to boost adaptability and cut re-training costs. However, existing approaches are inherently coarse-grained, lacking the necessary precision for granular knowledge extraction and the aggregation efficiency required to fuse knowledge from either a large number of source models or those with high parameter counts. We address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to first decompose each source model into its elementary, rank-one components. A subsequent aggregation stage then selects only the most salient components from all sources, thereby overcoming the previous efficiency and precision limitations. To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge base, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal singular values of the merged matrix. In essence, this process only recalibrates the importance of top SVD components. The proposed framework allows for efficient transfer learning, is robust to perturbations both at the input level and in the parameter space (e.g., noisy or pruned sources), and scales well computationally.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data, yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs' implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) often deals with suboptimal data when collecting large expert datasets is unavailable or impractical. This limitation makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.

  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an efficient approach to resource allocation due to its strong capability in handling complex decision-making tasks. However, only limited research has explored the training of DRL models with real-world data in practical, distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for training DRL models in real-world distributed IoT environments. In the proposed framework, IoT devices select communication channels using a DRL-based method, while the DRL model is trained with feedback information. Specifically, Acknowledgment (ACK) information is obtained from actual data transmissions over the selected channels. Implementation and performance evaluation, in terms of Frame Success Rate (FSR), are carried out, demonstrating both the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces. Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

  Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set, which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing. However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper presents GRADSTOP, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that GRADSTOP achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings, such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP). This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the remaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a privacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each communication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental results across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only maintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also achieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution, asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable, decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models (LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second, GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage, GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

  Synthetic data generation represents a significant advancement in boosting the performance of machine learning (ML) models, particularly in fields where data acquisition is challenging, such as echocardiography. The acquisition and labeling of echocardiograms (echo) for heart assessment, crucial in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) settings, often encounter limitations due to the restricted number of echo views available, typically captured by operators with varying levels of experience. This study proposes a novel approach for enhancing clinical diagnosis accuracy by synthetically generating echo views. These views are conditioned on existing, real views of the heart, focusing specifically on the estimation of ejection fraction (EF), a critical parameter traditionally measured from biplane apical views. By integrating a conditional generative model, we demonstrate an improvement in EF estimation accuracy, providing a comparative analysis with traditional methods. Preliminary results indicate that our synthetic echoes, when used to augment existing datasets, not only enhance EF estimation but also show potential in advancing the development of more robust, accurate, and clinically relevant ML models. This approach is anticipated to catalyze further research in synthetic data applications, paving the way for innovative solutions in medical imaging diagnostics.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

  While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as the model size increases. In this work, we proposed an EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed a structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the model using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Subsequently, the resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used multi-event datasets covering both interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure detection, and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed the existing methods. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  _Rapheal Huang, Weilong Guo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also discover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query strategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better. We can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the queries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the size should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards, protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training, while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance, validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model decisions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost. The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets, traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

  We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional wisdom dictates that small batch sizes make language model pretraining and fine-tuning unstable, motivating gradient accumulation, which trades off the number of optimizer steps for a proportional increase in batch size. While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes, other hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small batch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for scaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. In particular, rather than holding the decay rate of the second moment fixed across batch sizes, we propose to hold its half-life fixed in terms of tokens. We find that small batch sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD, even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state. Building on these results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a batch size and setting optimizer hyperparameters. We further recommend against gradient accumulation unless training on multiple devices with multiple model replicas. Finally, we show that a small batch size combined with an optimizer with a small state size can provide the performance benefits of full fine-tuning while maintaining a similar memory footprint to LoRA.

  Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has emerged as an effective method to enhance the robustness of lightweight deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Current ARD approaches have leveraged a large robust teacher network to train one robust lightweight student. However, due to the diverse range of edge devices and resource constraints, current approaches require training a new student network from scratch to meet specific constraints, leading to substantial computational costs and increased CO2 emissions. This paper proposes Progressive Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ProARD), enabling the efficient one-time training of a dynamic network that supports a diverse range of accurate and robust student networks without requiring retraining. We first make a dynamic deep neural network based on dynamic layers by encompassing variations in width, depth, and expansion in each design stage to support a wide range of architectures. Then, we consider the student network with the largest size as the dynamic teacher network. ProARD trains this dynamic network using a weight-sharing mechanism to jointly optimize the dynamic teacher network and its internal student networks. However, due to the high computational cost of calculating exact gradients for all the students within the dynamic network, a sampling mechanism is required to select a subset of students. We show that random student sampling in each iteration fails to produce accurate and robust students.

  Long-term forecasting of multivariate urban data poses a significant challenge due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in such datasets. This paper presents DST, a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that integrates graph attention and temporal convolution within a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies, respectively. To enhance model performance, we apply a decomposition-based preprocessing step that isolates trend, seasonal, and residual components of the time series, enabling the learning of distinct graph structures for different time-series components. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, including electricity demand, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution, demonstrate the effectiveness of DST across a range of forecast horizons, from several days to one month. Specifically, our approach achieves an average improvement of 2.89% to 9.10% in long-term forecasting accuracy over state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models.

  We present a novel theoretical interpretation of AlphaFold1 that reveals the potential of generalized Bayesian updating for probabilistic deep learning. The seminal breakthrough of AlphaFold1 in protein structure prediction by deep learning relied on a learned potential energy function, in contrast to the later end-to-end architectures of AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. While this potential was originally justified by referring to physical potentials of mean force (PMFs), we reinterpret AlphaFold1's potential as an instance of {\em probability kinematics} -- also known as {\em Jeffrey conditioning} -- a principled but under-recognised generalization of conventional Bayesian updating. Probability kinematics accommodates uncertain or {\em soft} evidence in the form of updated probabilities over a partition. This perspective reveals AlphaFold1's potential as a form of generalized Bayesian updating, rather than a thermodynamic potential. To confirm our probabilistic framework's scope and precision, we analyze a synthetic 2D model in which an angular random walk prior is updated with evidence on distances via probability kinematics, mirroring AlphaFold1's approach. This theoretical contribution connects AlphaFold1 to a broader class of well-justified Bayesian methods, allowing precise quantification, surpassing merely qualitative heuristics based on PMFs. Our contribution is theoretical: we replace AlphaFold1's heuristic analogy with a principled probabilistic framework, tested in a controlled synthetic setting where correctness can be assessed. More broadly, our results point to the considerable promise of probability kinematics for probabilistic deep learning, by allowing the formulation of complex models from a few simpler components.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--denoted as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

  Machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed in real-world applications like medicine or economics, thus, potentially affecting large populations. However, ML models often do not perform homogeneously, leading to underperformance or, conversely, unusually high performance in certain subgroups (e.g., sex=female AND marital_status=married). Identifying such subgroups can support practical decisions on which subpopulation a model is safe to deploy or where more training data is required. However, an efficient and coherent framework for effective search is missing. Consequently, we introduce SubROC, an open-source, easy-to-use framework based on Exceptional Model Mining for reliably and efficiently finding strengths and weaknesses of classification models in the form of interpretable population subgroups. SubROC incorporates common evaluation measures (ROC and PR AUC), efficient search space pruning for fast exhaustive subgroup search, control for class imbalance, adjustment for redundant patterns, and significance testing. We illustrate the practical benefits of SubROC in case studies as well as in comparative analyses across multiple datasets.

  Everyday locomotion is a complex sensorimotor process that can unfold over multiple timescales, from long-term path planning to rapid, reactive adjustments. However, we lack an understanding of how factors such as environmental demands, or the available sensory information simultaneously influence these control timescales. To address this, we present a unified data-driven framework to quantify the control timescales by identifying how early we can predict future actions from past inputs. We apply this framework across tasks including walking and running, environmental contexts including treadmill, overground, and varied terrains, and sensory input modalities including gaze fixations and body states. We find that deep neural network architectures that effectively handle long-range dependencies, specifically Gated Recurrent Units and Transformers, outperform other architectures and widely used linear models when predicting future actions. Our framework reveals the factors that influence locomotor foot placement control timescales. Across environmental contexts, we discover that humans rely more on fast timescale control in more complex terrain. Across input modalities, we find a hierarchy of control timescales where gaze predicts foot placement before full-body states, which predict before center-of-mass states. Our model also identifies mid-swing as a critical phase when the swing foot's state predicts its future placement, with this timescale adapting across environments. Overall, this work offers data-driven insights into locomotor control in everyday settings, offering models that can be integrated with rehabilitation technologies and movement simulations to improve their applicability in everyday settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low precision (LP) datatypes such as MXFP4 can accelerate matrix multiplications (GEMMs) and reduce training costs. However, directly using MXFP4 instead of BF16 during training significantly degrades model quality. In this work, we present the first near-lossless training recipe that uses MXFP4 GEMMs, which are $2\times$ faster than FP8 on supported hardware. Our key insight is to compute unbiased gradient estimates with stochastic rounding (SR), resulting in more accurate model updates. However, directly applying SR to MXFP4 can result in high variance from block-level outliers, harming convergence. To overcome this, we use the random Hadamard tranform to theoretically bound the variance of SR. We train GPT models up to 6.7B parameters and find that our method induces minimal degradation over mixed-precision BF16 training. Our recipe computes $>1/2$ the training FLOPs in MXFP4, enabling an estimated speedup of $>1.3\times$ over FP8 and $>1.7\times$ over BF16 during backpropagation.

  Clustering ensemble has been a popular research topic in data science due to its ability to improve the robustness of the single clustering method. Many clustering ensemble methods have been proposed, most of which can be categorized into clustering-view and sample-view methods. The clustering-view method is generally efficient, but it could be affected by the unreliability that existed in base clustering results. The sample-view method shows good performance, while the construction of the pairwise sample relation is time-consuming. In this paper, the clustering ensemble is formulated as a k-HyperEdge Medoids discovery problem and a clustering ensemble method based on k-HyperEdge Medoids that considers the characteristics of the above two types of clustering ensemble methods is proposed. In the method, a set of hyperedges is selected from the clustering view efficiently, then the hyperedges are diffused and adjusted from the sample view guided by a hyperedge loss function to construct an effective k-HyperEdge Medoid set. The loss function is mainly reduced by assigning samples to the hyperedge with the highest degree of belonging. Theoretical analyses show that the solution can approximate the optimal, the assignment method can gradually reduce the loss function, and the estimation of the belonging degree is statistically reasonable. Experiments on artificial data show the working mechanism of the proposed method. The convergence of the method is verified by experimental analysis of twenty data sets. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are also verified on these data, with nine representative clustering ensemble algorithms as reference.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities ofthis http URLfindings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.

  Existing text representations such as embeddings and bag-of-words are not suitable for rule learning due to their high dimensionality and absent or questionable feature-level interpretability. This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text. We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact. An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful. We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text. The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness. As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules. Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  On policy reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO are attractive for continuous control but suffer from poor sample efficiency in costly, high dimensional settings. We present a strictly on policy framework that treats a conditional diffusion model as an adaptable action prior rather than a policy or world model. The prior is pre trained on logged data and used online only at sampling time to propose actions at current on policy states. Two lightweight mechanisms - value guided proposal generation (energy re weighting and in process gradient guidance) and a soft prior KL - regularize the actor via a small auxiliary imitation loss while keeping all PPO updates strictly on on-policy rollouts. To adapt the prior without heavy compute, we apply parameter efficient tuning (PET) that updates only adapters/LoRA, yielding a dual proximal view: policy KL is constrained by PPO and prior KL by PET. Across eight MuJoCo tasks under a shared 1.0M step budget, our method improves early learning (ALC@40) in 3/4 settings and matches or exceeds final return on 6/8 tasks with only 15-30% wall clock overhead. Ablations show that freezing the prior degrades performance and removing value guidance slows early learning; t SNE analyses confirm that value guidance concentrates proposals in high Q regions. Results indicate that an adaptable diffusion action prior is a practical way to boost on policy PPO under tight interaction budgets.

  Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) and heterogeneous GNNs (HGNNs) have advanced node embeddings and relationship learning for various tasks. However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined meta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node type, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce MF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of predefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates multi-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse aspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and creates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering. Extensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a more flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks. The code is available atthis https URL.

  To find the shortest paths for all pairs on manifolds with infinitesimally defined metrics, we introduce a framework to generate them by predicting midpoints recursively. To learn midpoint prediction, we propose an actor-critic approach. We prove the soundness of our approach and show experimentally that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on several planning tasks, including path planning for agents with complex kinematics and motion planning for multi-degree-of-freedom robot arms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The nodes' interconnections on a social network often reflect their dependencies and information-sharing behaviors. Nevertheless, abnormal nodes, which significantly deviate from most of the network concerning patterns or behaviors, can lead to grave consequences. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient online learning algorithms that robustly learn users' preferences while simultaneously detecting anomalies.We introduce a novel bandit algorithm to address this problem. Through network knowledge, the method characterizes the users' preferences and residuals of feature information. By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies. We rigorously prove an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm and experimentally compare it with several state-of-the-art collaborative contextual bandit algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cataract surgery remains one of the most widely performed and effective procedures for vision restoration. Effective surgical planning requires integrating diverse clinical examinations for patient assessment, intraocular lens (IOL) selection, and risk evaluation. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting clinical decision-making. However, existing LLMs often lack the domain-specific expertise to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic data and provide actionable surgical plans. To enhance the model's ability to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic reports, we propose a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS), where each agent simulates the reasoning process of specialist ophthalmologists, converting raw clinical inputs into structured, actionable summaries in both training and deployment stages. Building on MAS, we introduce CataractSurg-80K, the first large-scale benchmark for cataract surgery planning that incorporates structured clinical reasoning. Each case is annotated with diagnostic questions, expert reasoning chains, and structured surgical recommendations. We further introduce Qwen-CSP, a domain-specialized model built on Qwen-4B, fine-tuned through a multi-stage process tailored for surgical planning. Comprehensive experiments show that Qwen-CSP outperforms strong general-purpose LLMs across multiple metrics. Our work delivers a high-quality dataset, a rigorous benchmark, and a domain-adapted LLM to facilitate future research in medical AI reasoning and decision support.

  Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths. Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore, developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and execution efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace. While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models. The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and (3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.

  Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation. Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors. Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper presents a visio-verbal teleimpedance interface for commanding 3D stiffness ellipsoids to the remote robot with a combination of the operator's gaze and verbal interaction. The gaze is detected by an eye-tracker, allowing the system to understand the context in terms of what the operator is currently looking at in the scene. Along with verbal interaction, a Visual Language Model (VLM) processes this information, enabling the operator to communicate their intended action or provide corrections. Based on these inputs, the interface can then generate appropriate stiffness matrices for different physical interaction actions. To validate the proposed visio-verbal teleimpedance interface, we conducted a series of experiments on a setup including a Force Dimension Sigma.7 haptic device to control the motion of the remote Kuka LBR iiwa robotic arm. The human operator's gaze is tracked by Tobii Pro Glasses 2, while human verbal commands are processed by a VLM using GPT-4o. The first experiment explored the optimal prompt configuration for the interface. The second and third experiments demonstrated different functionalities of the interface on a slide-in-the-groove task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.

  Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) allows agents to autonomously learn diverse behaviors without task-specific rewards. While recent USD methods have shown promise, their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in the safety, interpretability, and deployability of the learned skills. Our approach employs user-defined factorization of the state space to learn disentangled skill representations. It assigns different skill discovery algorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To encourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based inductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style factor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We evaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate zero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show that factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured human-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance safety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can be used for downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with hand-crafted rewards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unified physics-based humanoid controllers are pivotal for robotics and character animation, yet models that excel on gentle, everyday motions still stumble on explosive actions, hampering real-world deployment. We bridge this gap with FARM (Frame-Accelerated Augmentation and Residual Mixture-of-Experts), an end-to-end framework composed of frame-accelerated augmentation, a robust base controller, and a residual mixture-of-experts (MoE). Frame-accelerated augmentation exposes the model to high-velocity pose changes by widening inter-frame gaps. The base controller reliably tracks everyday low-dynamic motions, while the residual MoE adaptively allocates additional network capacity to handle challenging high-dynamic actions, significantly enhancing tracking accuracy. In the absence of a public benchmark, we curate the High-Dynamic Humanoid Motion (HDHM) dataset, comprising 3593 physically plausible clips. On HDHM, FARM reduces the tracking failure rate by 42.8\% and lowers global mean per-joint position error by 14.6\% relative to the baseline, while preserving near-perfect accuracy on low-dynamic motions. These results establish FARM as a new baseline for high-dynamic humanoid control and introduce the first open benchmark dedicated to this challenge.

  This paper presents a standing support mobility robot "Moby" developed to enhance independence and safety for elderly individuals during daily activities such as toilet transfers. Unlike conventional seated mobility aids, the robot maintains users in an upright posture, reducing physical strain, supporting natural social interaction at eye level, and fostering a greater sense of self-efficacy. Moby offers a novel alternative by functioning both passively and with mobility support, enabling users to perform daily tasks more independently. Its main advantages include ease of use, lightweight design, comfort, versatility, and effective sit-to-stand assistance. The robot leverages the Robot Operating System (ROS) for seamless control, featuring manual and autonomous operation modes. A custom control system enables safe and intuitive interaction, while the integration with NAV2 and LiDAR allows for robust navigation capabilities. This paper reviews existing mobility solutions and compares them to Moby, details the robot's design, and presents objective and subjective experimental results using the NASA-TLX method and time comparisons to other methods to validate our design criteria and demonstrate the advantages of our contribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimal path planning aims to determine a sequence of states from a start to a goal while accounting for planning objectives. Popular methods often integrate fixed batch sizes and neglect information on obstacles, which is not problem-specific. This study introduces Adaptively Prolated Trees (APT*), a novel sampling-based motion planner that extends based on Force Direction Informed Trees (FDIT*), integrating adaptive batch-sizing and elliptical $r$-nearest neighbor modules to dynamically modulate the path searching process based on environmental feedback. APT* adjusts batch sizes based on the hypervolume of the informed sets and considers vertices as electric charges that obey Coulomb's law to define virtual forces via neighbor samples, thereby refining the prolate nearest neighbor selection. These modules employ non-linear prolate methods to adaptively adjust the electric charges of vertices for force definition, thereby improving the convergence rate with lower solution costs. Comparative analyses show that APT* outperforms existing single-query sampling-based planners in dimensions from $\mathbb{R}^4$ to $\mathbb{R}^{16}$, and it was further validated through a real-world robot manipulation task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in everyday indoor scenes, aimed at improving real-time risk awareness in service robots operating in human-centric environments. As robots become integrated into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bidirectional motion planning often reduces planning time compared to its unidirectional counterparts. It requires connecting the forward and reverse search trees to form a continuous path. However, this process could fail and restart the asymmetric bidirectional search due to the limitations of lazy-reverse search. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD Grafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge connections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling rapid path convergence. G3T* employs a greedy approach using the minimum Lebesgue measure of guided incremental local densification (GuILD) subsets to optimize paths efficiently. Furthermore, G3T* dynamically adjusts the sampling distribution between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and current cost improvements, ensuring asymptotic optimality. These features enhance the forward search's growth towards the reverse tree, achieving faster convergence and lower solution costs. Benchmark experiments across dimensions from R^2 to R^8 and real-world robotic evaluations demonstrate G3T*'s superior performance compared to existing single-query sampling-based planners.

  Path planning has long been an important and active research area in robotics. To address challenges in high-dimensional motion planning, this study introduces the Force Direction Informed Trees (FDIT*), a sampling-based planner designed to enhance speed and cost-effectiveness in pathfinding. FDIT* builds upon the state-of-the-art informed sampling planner, the Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), by capitalizing on often-overlooked information in invalid vertices. It incorporates principles of physical force, particularly Coulomb's law. This approach proposes the elliptical $k$-nearest neighbors search method, enabling fast convergence navigation and avoiding high solution cost or infeasible paths by exploring more problem-specific search-worthy areas. It demonstrates benefits in search efficiency and cost reduction, particularly in confined, high-dimensional environments. It can be viewed as an extension of nearest neighbors search techniques. Fusing invalid vertex data with physical dynamics facilitates force-direction-based search regions, resulting in an improved convergence rate to the optimum. FDIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners on the tested problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated on a real-world mobile manipulation task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in applications, such as intralogistics or autonomous delivery, where multiple robots collaborate to complete tasks efficiently. One of the key factors enabling their efficient cooperation is Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Algorithms solving this problem optimize task distribution among robots to minimize the overall execution time. In shared environments, apart from the relative distance between the robots and the tasks, the execution time is also significantly impacted by the delay caused by navigating around moving people. However, most existing MRTA approaches are dynamics-agnostic, relying on static maps and neglecting human motion patterns, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In this paper, we introduce \acrfull{method name}. This method leverages Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal queryable models designed to capture historical human movement patterns, to estimate the impact of humans on the task execution time during deployment. \acrshort{method name} utilizes a stochastic cost function that includes MoDs. Experimental results show that integrating MoDs enhances task allocation performance, resulting in reduced mission completion times by up to $26\%$ compared to the dynamics-agnostic method and up to $19\%$ compared to the baseline. This work underscores the importance of considering human dynamics in MRTA within shared environments and presents an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems in environments populated by humans.

  _Dongjae Lee, Byeongjun Kim, H. Jin Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aerial manipulators based on conventional multirotors can conduct manipulation only in small roll and pitch angles due to the underactuatedness of the multirotor base. If the multirotor base is capable of hovering at arbitrary orientation, the robot can freely locate itself at any point in $\mathsf{SE}(3)$, significantly extending its manipulation workspace and enabling a manipulation task that was originally not viable. In this work, we present a geometric robust control and whole-body motion planning framework for an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (OAM). To maximize the strength of OAM, we first propose a geometric robust controller for a floating base. Since the motion of the robotic arm and the interaction forces during manipulation affect the stability of the floating base, the base should be capable of mitigating these adverse effects while controlling its 6D pose. We then design a two-step optimization-based whole-body motion planner, jointly considering the pose of the floating base and the joint angles of the robotic arm to harness the entire configuration space. The devised two-step approach facilitates real-time applicability and enhances convergence of the optimization problem with non-convex and non-Euclidean search space. The proposed approach enables the base to be stationary at any 6D pose while autonomously carrying out sophisticated manipulation near obstacles without any collision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments in which an OAM performs grasping and pulling of an object in multiple scenarios, including near $90^\circ$ and even $180^\circ$ pitch angles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an Impedance Primitive-augmented hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for efficient robotic manipulation in sequential contact tasks. We leverage this hierarchical structure to sequentially execute behavior primitives with variable stiffness control capabilities for contact tasks. Our proposed approach relies on three key components: an action space enabling variable stiffness control, an adaptive stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness adjustments during primitive execution, and affordance coupling for efficient exploration while encouraging compliance. Through comprehensive training and evaluation, our framework learns efficient stiffness control capabilities and demonstrates improvements in learning efficiency, compositionality in primitive selection, and success rates compared to the state-of-the-art. The training environments include block lifting, door opening, object pushing, and surface cleaning. Real world evaluations further confirm the framework's sim2real capability. This work lays the foundation for more adaptive and versatile robotic manipulation systems, with potential applications in more complex contact-based tasks.

  Robots operating in human-populated environments must navigate safely and efficiently while minimizing social disruption. Achieving this requires estimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional microscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational cost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either overly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human motion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our approach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent characteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the overhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in inference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a socially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that efficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments without costly computations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Digital twin applications offered transformative potential by enabling real-time monitoring and robotic simulation through accurate virtual replicas of physical assets. The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees. Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for scalable agricultural digital twin systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense collections of movable objects are common in everyday spaces -- from cabinets in a home to shelves in a warehouse. Safely retracting objects from such collections is difficult for robots, yet people do it easily, using non-prehensile tactile sensing on the sides and backs of their hands and arms. We investigate the role of such sensing for training robots to gently reach into constrained clutter and extract objects. The available sensing modalities are (1) "eye-in-hand" vision, (2) proprioception, (3) non-prehensile triaxial tactile sensing, (4) contact wrenches estimated from joint torques, and (5) a measure of successful object acquisition obtained by monitoring the vacuum line of a suction cup. We use imitation learning to train policies from a set of demonstrations on randomly generated scenes, then conduct an ablation study of wrench and tactile information. We evaluate each policy's performance across 40 unseen environment configurations. Policies employing any force sensing show fewer excessive force failures, an increased overall success rate, and faster completion times. The best performance is achieved using both tactile and wrench information, producing an 80% improvement above the baseline without force information.

  This paper presents crash rate benchmarks for evaluating US-based Automated Driving Systems (ADS) for multiple urban areas. The purpose of this study was to extend prior benchmarks focused only on surface streets to additionally capture freeway crash risk for future ADS safety performance assessments. Using publicly available police-reported crash and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data, the methodology details the isolation of in-transport passenger vehicles, road type classification, and crash typology. Key findings revealed that freeway crash rates exhibit large geographic dependence variations with any-injury-reported crash rates being nearly 3.5 times higher in Atlanta (2.4 IPMM; the highest) when compared to Phoenix (0.7 IPMM; the lowest). The results show the critical need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety evaluations and provide insights into the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) required to achieve statistical significance for various safety impact levels. The distribution of crash types depended on the outcome severity level. Higher severity outcomes (e.g., fatal crashes) had a larger proportion of single-vehicle, vulnerable road users (VRU), and opposite-direction collisions compared to lower severity (police-reported) crashes. Given heterogeneity in crash types by severity, performance in low-severity scenarios may not be predictive of high-severity outcomes. These benchmarks are additionally used to quantify at the required mileage to show statistically significant deviations from human performance. This is the first paper to generate freeway-specific benchmarks for ADS evaluation and provides a foundational framework for future ADS benchmarking by evaluators and developers.

Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions. However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the \textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200 instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances. Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces FlipWalker, a novel underactuated robot locomotion system inspired by Jacob's Ladder illusion toy, designed to traverse challenging terrains where wheeled robots often struggle. Like the Jacob's Ladder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner reminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the opposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface, offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating irregular outdoor terrain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intraocular foreign body removal demands millimeter-level precision in confined intraocular spaces, yet existing robotic systems predominantly rely on manual teleoperation with steep learning curves. To address the challenges of autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.

  Accurate and reliable navigation is crucial for autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras, odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset includes ten larger-scale sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets, and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters. High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have superior data quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing real-world robotic manipulation. Yet existing datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to (1) the lack of scalable task generation methods and (2) oversimplified simulation environments. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable framework for automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, together with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. At its core is RoboTwin-OD, an object library of 731 instances across 147 categories with semantic and manipulation-relevant annotations. Building on this, we design an expert data synthesis pipeline that leverages multimodal language models (MLLMs) and simulation-in-the-loop refinement to automatically generate task-level execution code. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 applies structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height, and language, enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. The framework is instantiated across 50 dual-arm tasks and five robot embodiments. Empirically, it yields a 10.9% gain in code generation success rate. For downstream policy learning, a VLA model trained with synthetic data plus only 10 real demonstrations achieves a 367% relative improvement over the 10-demo baseline, while zero-shot models trained solely on synthetic data obtain a 228% gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of RoboTwin 2.0 in strengthening sim-to-real transfer and robustness to environmental variations. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation. Project Page:this https URL, Code:this https URL.

  Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations ($R^2=0.8$) than the best existing open-loop approach ($R^2=0.7$). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Staircase Recognition and Location Based on Polarization Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19026)**  `arXiv:2505.19026`  
  _Weifeng Kong, Zhiying Tan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Staircase is one of the most common structures in artificial scenes. However, it is difficult for humanoid robots and people with lower limb disabilities or visual impairment to cross the scene without the help of sensors and intelligent algorithms. Staircase scene perception technology is a prerequisite for recognition and localization. This technology is of great significance for the mode switching of the robot and the calculation of the footprint position to adapt to the discontinuous terrain. However, there are still many problems that constrain the application of this technology, such as low recognition accuracy, high initial noise from sensors, unstable output signals and high computational requirements. In terms of scene reconstruction, the binocular and time of flight (TOF) reconstruction of the scene can be easily affected by environmental light and the surface material of the target object. In contrast, due to the special structure of the polarizer, the polarization can selectively transmit polarized light in a specific direction and this reconstruction method relies on the polarization information of the object surface. So the advantages of polarization reconstruction are reflected, which are less affected by environmental light and not dependent on the texture information of the object surface. In this paper, in order to achieve the detection of staircase, this paper proposes a contrast enhancement algorithm that integrates polarization and light intensity information, and integrates point cloud segmentation based on YOLOv11. To realize the high-quality reconstruction, we proposed a method of fusing polarized binocular and TOF depth information to realize the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the staircase. Besides, it also proposes a joint calibration algorithm of monocular camera and TOF camera based on ICP registration and improved gray wolf optimization algorithm.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

  Embodied foundation models are gaining increasing attention for their zero-shot generalization, scalability, and adaptability to new tasks through few-shot post-training. However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences. We will release SynGrasp-1B dataset and pre-trained weights to benefit the community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In swarm robotics, confrontation scenarios, including strategic confrontations, require efficient decision-making that integrates discrete commands and continuous actions. Traditional task and motion planning methods separate decision-making into two layers, but their unidirectional structure fails to capture the interdependence between these layers, limiting adaptability in dynamic environments. Here, we propose a novel bidirectional approach based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic interaction between the layers. This method effectively maps commands to task allocation and actions to path planning, while leveraging cross-training techniques to enhance learning across the hierarchical framework. Furthermore, we introduce a trajectory prediction model that bridges abstract task representations with actionable planning goals. In our experiments, it achieves over 80% in confrontation win rate and under 0.01 seconds in decision time, outperforming existing approaches. Demonstrations through large-scale tests and real-world robot experiments further emphasize the generalization capabilities and practical applicability of our method.

  Achieving controlled jumping behaviour for a quadruped robot is a challenging task, especially when introducing passive compliance in mechanical design. This study addresses this challenge via imitation-based deep reinforcement learning with a progressive training process. To start, we learn the jumping skill by mimicking a coarse jumping example generated by model-based trajectory optimization. Subsequently, we generalize the learned policy to broader situations, including various distances in both forward and lateral directions, and then pursue robust jumping in unknown ground unevenness. In addition, without tuning the reward much, we learn the jumping policy for a quadruped with parallel elasticity. Results show that using the proposed method, i) the robot learns versatile jumps by learning only from a single demonstration, ii) the robot with parallel compliance reduces the landing error by 11.1%, saves energy cost by 15.2% and reduces the peak torque by 15.8%, compared to the rigid robot without parallel elasticity, iii) the robot can perform jumps of variable distances with robustness against ground unevenness (maximal 4cm height perturbations) using only proprioceptive perception.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pursuit-evasion (PE) problem is a critical challenge in multi-robot systems (MRS). While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its promise in addressing PE tasks, research has primarily focused on single-target pursuit, with limited exploration of multi-target encirclement, particularly in large-scale settings. This paper proposes a Transformer-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (TERL) framework for large-scale multi-target encirclement. By integrating a transformer-based policy network with target selection, TERL enables robots to adaptively prioritize targets and safely coordinate robots. Results show that TERL outperforms existing RL-based methods in terms of encirclement success rate and task completion time, while maintaining good performance in large-scale scenarios. Notably, TERL, trained on small-scale scenarios (15 pursuers, 4 targets), generalizes effectively to large-scale settings (80 pursuers, 20 targets) without retraining, achieving a 100% success rate.

  Cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM) enables multiple agents to work together in mapping unknown environments while simultaneously estimating their own positions. This approach enhances robustness, scalability, and accuracy by sharing information between agents, reducing drift, and enabling collective exploration of larger areas. In this paper, we present Decentralized Visual Monocular SLAM (DVM-SLAM), the first open-source decentralized monocular C-SLAM system. By only utilizing low-cost and light-weight monocular vision sensors, our system is well suited for small robots and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). DVM-SLAM's real-world applicability is validated on physical robots with a custom collision avoidance framework, showcasing its potential in real-time multi-agent autonomous navigation scenarios. We also demonstrate comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art centralized monocular C-SLAM systems. We open-source our code and provide supplementary material online.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic collision detection (PCD) is essential in motion planning for robots operating in unstructured environments, where considering sensing uncertainty helps prevent damage. Existing PCD methods mainly used simplified geometric models and addressed only position estimation errors. This paper presents an enhanced PCD method with two key advancements: (a) using superquadrics for more accurate shape approximation and (b) accounting for both position and orientation estimation errors to improve robustness under sensing uncertainty. Our method first computes an enlarged surface for each object that encapsulates its observed rotated copies, thereby addressing the orientation estimation errors. Then, the collision probability under the position estimation errors is formulated as a chance-constraint problem that is solved with a tight upper bound. Both the two steps leverage the recently developed normal parameterization of superquadric surfaces. Results show that our PCD method is twice as close to the Monte-Carlo sampled baseline as the best existing PCD method and reduces path length by 30% and planning time by 37%, respectively. A Real2Sim2Real pipeline further validates the importance of considering orientation estimation errors, showing that the collision probability of executing the planned path in simulation is only 2%, compared to 9% and 29% when considering only position estimation errors or no errors at all.

  This letter presents a control framework for legged robots that enables self-perception and resistance to external disturbances and model uncertainties. First, a novel disturbance estimator is proposed, integrating adaptive control and extended state observers (ESO) to estimate external disturbances and model uncertainties. This estimator is embedded within the whole-body control framework to compensate for disturbances in the legged system. Second, a comprehensive whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (WB-DRC) is introduced, accounting for the robot's full-body dynamics. Compared to previous whole-body control frameworks, WB-DRC effectively handles external disturbances and model uncertainties, with the potential to adapt to complex terrain. Third, simulations of both biped and quadruped robots are conducted in the Gazebo simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on the quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the robot system using WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.

  In this paper, we present the main features of Dynamic Rapidly-exploring Generalized Bur Tree (DRGBT) algorithm, a sampling-based planner for dynamic environments. We provide a detailed time analysis and appropriate scheduling to facilitate a real-time operation. To this end, an extensive analysis is conducted to identify the time-critical routines and their dependence on the number of obstacles. Furthermore, information about the distance to obstacles is used to compute a structure called dynamic expanded bubble of free configuration space, which is then utilized to establish sufficient conditions for a guaranteed safe motion of the robot while satisfying all kinematic constraints. An extensive randomized simulation trial is conducted to compare the proposed algorithm to a competing state-of-the-art method. Finally, an experimental study on a real robot is carried out covering a variety of scenarios including those with human presence. The results show the effectiveness and feasibility of real-time execution of the proposed motion planning algorithm within a typical sensor-based arrangement, using cheap hardware and sequential architecture, without the necessity for GPUs or heavy parallelization.

This comprehensive review investigates traffic datasets and simulators as dual pillars supporting autonomous vehicle (AV) development. Unlike prior surveys that examine these resources independently, we present an integrated analysis spanning the entire AV pipeline-perception, localization, prediction, planning, and control.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sampling-based motion planning methods, while effective in high-dimensional spaces, often suffer from inefficiencies due to irregular sampling distributions, leading to suboptimal exploration of the configuration space. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances the efficiency of these methods by utilizing low-discrepancy distributions generated through Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC). MPMC leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate point sets that uniformly cover the space, with uniformity assessed using the the $\cL_p$-discrepancy measure, which quantifies the irregularity of sample distributions. By improving the uniformity of the point sets, our approach significantly reduces computational overhead and the number of samples required for solving motion planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional sampling techniques in terms of planning efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Differentiable simulators promise to improve sample efficiency in robot learning by providing analytic gradients of the system dynamics. Yet, their application to contact-rich tasks like locomotion is complicated by the inherently non-smooth nature of contact, impeding effective gradient-based optimization. Existing works thus often rely on soft contact models that provide smooth gradients but lack physical accuracy, constraining results to simulation. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable contact model designed to provide informative gradients while maintaining high physical fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a quadrupedal locomotion policy within our differentiable simulator leveraging analytic gradients and successfully transferring the learned policy zero-shot to the real world. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful sim-to-real transfer of a legged locomotion policy learned entirely within a differentiable simulator, establishing the feasibility of using differentiable simulation for real-world locomotion control.

  Automated parking is a self-driving feature that has been in cars for several years. Parking assistants in currently sold cars fail to park in more complex real-world scenarios and require the driver to move the car to an expected starting position before the assistant is activated. We overcome these limitations by proposing a planning algorithm consisting of two stages: (1) a geometric planner for maneuvering inside the parking slot and (2) a Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)-based planner that finds a collision-free path from the initial position to the slot entry. Evaluation of computational experiments demonstrates that improvements over commonly used RRT extensions reduce the parking path cost by 21 % and reduce the computation time by 79.5 %. The suitability of the algorithm for real-world parking scenarios was verified in physical experiments with Porsche Cayenne.

  Shared autonomy is an operational concept in which a user and an autonomous agent collaboratively control a robotic system. It provides a number of advantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many settings. Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the environment dynamics, a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or knowledge of the user's policy -- assumptions that are unrealistic in many domains. Recent works relax some of these assumptions by formulating shared autonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, they no longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete or constrained) or environment dynamics. However, they need knowledge of a task-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward specification can be a difficult and brittle process. On top of that, the formulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training, and that necessitates them to prepare a policy that mimics users' behavior. In this paper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation of the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models. Our approach does not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in contrast to previous work, it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it require access to the user's policy during training. Instead, our framework learns a distribution over a space of desired behaviors. It then employs a diffusion model to translate the user's actions to a sample from this distribution. Crucially, we show that it is possible to carry out this process in a manner that preserves the user's control authority. We evaluate our framework on a series of challenging continuous control tasks, and analyze its ability to effectively correct user actions while maintaining their autonomy.
