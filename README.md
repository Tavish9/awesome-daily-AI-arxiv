- **[Privileged Self-Access Matters for Introspection in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14802)**  `arXiv:2508.14802`  
  _Siyuan Song, Harvey Lederman, Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined. Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any process which yields information about internal states through a process more reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

- **[Data-Driven Probabilistic Evaluation of Logic Properties with PAC-Confidence on Mealy Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14710)**  `arXiv:2508.14710`  
  _Swantje Plambeck, Ali Salamati, Eyke Huellermeier, Goerschwin Fey_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

- **[MCP-Universe: Benchmarking Large Language Models with Real-World Model Context Protocol Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14704)**  `arXiv:2508.14704`  
  _Ziyang Luo, Zhiqi Shen, Wenzhuo Yang, Zirui Zhao, Prathyusha Jwalapuram, Amrita Saha, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.

- **[Entropy-Constrained Strategy Optimization in Urban Floods: A Multi-Agent Framework with LLM and Knowledge Graph Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14654)**  `arXiv:2508.14654`  
  _Peilin Ji, Xiao Xue, Simeng Wang, Wenhao Yan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation) requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency. Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban flood response.

  _Chendong Song, Zihan Wang, Frederick Pu, Haiming Wang, Xiaohan Lin, Junqi Liu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields. Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of LeanGeo atthis https URL.

- **[The Agent Behavior: Model, Governance and Challenges in the AI Digital Age](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14415)**  `arXiv:2508.14415`  
  _Qiang Zhang, Pei Yan, Yijia Xu, Chuanpo Fu, Yong Fang, Yang Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6 stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity (HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency, intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns. The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

- **[Automated Optimization Modeling through Expert-Guided Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14410)**  `arXiv:2508.14410`  
  _Beinuo Yang, Qishen Zhou, Junyi Li, Xingchen Su, Simon Hu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations: high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes, providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization modeling.

- **[Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14294)**  `arXiv:2508.14294`  
  _Maria Leonor Pacheco, Fabio Somenzi, Dananjay Srinivas, Ashutosh Trivedi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However, they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for, or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear, disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence) organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

  _Yang Cheng, Zilai Wang, Weiyu Ma, Wenhui Zhu, Yue Deng, Jian Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However, their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in real-world, high-complexity domains.

- **[EoH-S: Evolution of Heuristic Set using LLMs for Automated Heuristic Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03082)**  `arXiv:2508.03082`  
  _Fei Liu, Yilu Liu, Qingfu Zhang, Xialiang Tong, Mingxuan Yuan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances, often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings. To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances, such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics. Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\% performance improvements.

- **[SE-Agent: Self-Evolution Trajectory Optimization in Multi-Step Reasoning with LLM-Based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02085)**  `arXiv:2508.02085`  
  _Jiaye Lin, Yifu Guo, Yuzhen Han, Sen Hu, Ziyi Ni, Licheng Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations: revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories, and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly available atthis https URL.

- **[The NordDRG AI Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13790)**  `arXiv:2506.13790`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are being piloted for clinical coding and decision support, yet no open benchmark targets the hospital-funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) determine reimbursement. In most OECD systems, DRGs route a substantial share of multi-trillion-dollar health spending through governed grouper software, making transparency and auditability first-order concerns. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first public, rule-complete test bed for DRG reasoning. The package includes (i) machine-readable approximately 20-sheet NordDRG definition tables and (ii) expert manuals and change-log templates that capture governance workflows. It exposes two suites: a 13-task Logic benchmark (code lookup, cross-table inference, grouping features, multilingual terminology, and CC/MCC validity checks) and a 13-task Grouper benchmark that requires full DRG grouper emulation with strict exact-match scoring on both the DRG and the triggeringthis http URL. Lightweight reference agents (LogicAgent, GrouperAgent) enable artefact-only evaluation. Under an artefact-only (no web) setting, on the 13 Logic tasks GPT-5 Thinking and Opus 4.1 score 13/13, o3 scores 12/13; mid-tier models (GPT-5 Thinking Mini, o4-mini, GPT-5 Fast) achieve 6-8/13, and remaining models score 5/13 or below. On full grouper emulation across 13 tasks, GPT-5 Thinking solves 7/13, o3 6/13, o4-mini 3/13; GPT-5 Thinking Mini solves 1/13, and all other tested endpoints score 0/13. To our knowledge, this is the first public report of an LLM partially emulating the complete NordDRG grouper logic with governance-grade traceability. Coupling a rule-complete release with exact-match tasks and open scoring provides a reproducible yardstick for head-to-head and longitudinal evaluation in hospital funding.

- **[Robust Finite-Memory Policy Gradients for Hidden-Model POMDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09518)**  `arXiv:2505.09518`  
  _Maris F. L. Galesloot, Roman Andriushchenko, Milan ƒåe≈°ka, Sebastian Junges, Nils Jansen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model specific environments in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP, and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs, and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.

  _Xinji Mai, Haotian Xu, Zhong-Zhi Li, Xing W, Weinong Wang, Jian Hu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

  _Yimeng Min, Carla P. Gomes_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce PLUME search, a data-driven framework that enhances search efficiency in combinatorial optimization through unsupervised learning. Unlike supervised or reinforcement learning, PLUME search learns directly from problem instances using a permutation-based loss with a non-autoregressive approach. We evaluate its performance on the quadratic assignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard problem that encompasses various combinatorial optimization problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PLUME search consistently improves solution quality. Furthermore, we study the generalization behavior and show that the learned model generalizes across different densities and sizes.

  _Steve Huntsman, Jewell Thomas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We devise an algorithm to generate propositions that objectively instantiate graphs supporting coherence-driven inference. We also benchmark the ability of large language models (LLMs) to reconstruct coherence graphs from (a simple transformation of) propositions expressed in natural language, with promising results from a single prompt to reasoning-optimized LLMs. For example, o1/3/4-mini achieve perfect reconstruction half of the time on sparse graphs. Coherence-driven inference on consistency evaluations by LLMs may advance machine cognition capabilities.

  _Haokun Lin, Haobo Xu, Yichen Wu, Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Zhichao Lu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support the community.

  Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

  Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2) generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations, dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing strong generalization and cross-task adaptability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever for improving multilingual robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing, which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs. The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover, LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.

  We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency (BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy, and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and {\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging (SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of linguistic probing tasks.

  Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies. Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection, trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

  Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers, Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other low-resource languages.

  _Guilhem Faur√©, Mostafa Sadeghi, Sam Bigeard, Slim Ouni_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity, aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based SLP models.

  _Krunal Shah, Dan Roth_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument. While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability, they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation (which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

  We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However, performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm (IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs, DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence, correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance, our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available atthis https URL.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations: 1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation, Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP), shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective, they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms (e.g., kitap vs. kitabƒ±), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept activations for each class and language version. We average the different language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself. The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of internal network states with higher accuracy.

  As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles, abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR 2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source (DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap, semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4 Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to $\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

- **[DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)**  `arXiv:2508.14090`  
  _Chen Xu, Dawei Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a 16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention - clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods; 2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic, making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs, which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling (TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3) Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g., subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs and have implications for interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0% while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

  _Yiran Rex Ma_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3) When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of English-Chinese information structure.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision & Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

  _Xiao Liang, Zhongzhi Li, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Ying Nian Wu, Zhijiang Guo, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations, we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS) strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of SvS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases, where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch. It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL, leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and scalability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples} (STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

  We examine the role of transcription inconsistencies in the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition benchmark, a challenging low-resource ASR benchmark. With the help of a small, hand-constructed lexicon, we conclude that find that, while inconsistencies do exist in the transcriptions, they are not the main challenge in the task. We also demonstrate that bigram word-based language modelling is of no added benefit, but that constraining decoding to a finite lexicon can be beneficial. The task remains extremely difficult.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention. Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following, reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex, interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at improving these critical capabilities.

  _Xiao Zhang, Johan bos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural semantic parsers have shown good overall performance for a variety of linguistic phenomena, reaching semantic matching scores of more than 90%. But how do such parsers perform on strongly context-sensitive phenomena, where large pieces of semantic information need to be duplicated to form a meaningful semantic representation? A case in point is English verb phrase ellipsis, a construct where entire verb phrases can be abbreviated by a single auxiliary verb. Are the otherwise known as powerful semantic parsers able to deal with ellipsis or aren't they? We constructed a corpus of 120 cases of ellipsis with their fully resolved meaning representation and used this as a challenge set for a large battery of neural semantic parsers. Although these parsers performed very well on the standard test set, they failed in the instances with ellipsis. Data augmentation helped improve the parsing results. The reason for the difficulty of parsing elided phrases is not that copying semantic material is hard, but that usually occur in linguistically complicated contexts causing most of the parsing errors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity; however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG, respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various domains. We will release our code upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks. Specifically, Critique-GRPO improves average pass@1 scores across all compared methods by approximately +4.4% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and +3.8% on Qwen3-8B. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing, achieving significant gains over GRPO, e.g., +16.7% pass@1 improvement on AIME 2024.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Translating chart images into executable plotting scripts-referred to as the chart-to-code generation task-requires Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform fine-grained visual parsing, precise code synthesis, and robust cross-modal reasoning. However, this task is inherently under-constrained: multiple valid code implementations can produce the same visual chart, and evaluation must consider both code correctness and visual fidelity across diverse dimensions. This makes it difficult to learn accurate and generalizable mappings through standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a dual preference-guided refinement framework that combines a feedback-driven, dual-modality reward mechanism with iterative preference learning. Our approach introduces a structured variant generation strategy and a visual reward model to efficiently produce high-quality, aspect-aware preference pairs-making preference collection scalable and supervision more targeted. These preferences are used in an offline reinforcement learning setup to optimize the model toward multi-dimensional fidelity. Experimental results show that our framework significantly enhances the performance of general-purpose open-source MLLMs, enabling them to generate high-quality plotting code that rivals specialized chart-centric models and even some proprietary systems. The code and datasets are publicly available atthis https URL.

  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a scalable alternative to human annotation, yet existing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for judges approaches often fall short in domains requiring complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples - highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks requiring deep reasoning.

  LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, a substantial body of work in visually grounded natural language processing has focused on real-life multimodal scenarios such as describing content depicted in images or videos. However, comparatively less attention has been devoted to study the nature and degree of interaction between the different modalities in these scenarios. In this paper, we argue that any task dealing with natural language generation from sequences of images or frames is an instance of the broader, more general problem of modeling the intricate relationships between visual events unfolding over time and the features of the language used to interpret, describe, or narrate them. Therefore, solving these tasks requires models to be capable of identifying and managing such intricacies. We consider five seemingly different tasks, which we argue are compelling instances of this broader multimodal problem. Subsequently, we survey the modeling and evaluation approaches adopted for these tasks in recent years and examine the common set of challenges these tasks pose. Building on this perspective, we identify key open questions and propose several research directions for future investigation.

  We propose a novel paradigm for automatic fact-checking that leverages frame semantics to enhance the structured understanding of claims and guide the process of fact-checking them. To support this, we introduce a pilot dataset of real-world claims extracted from PolitiFact, specifically annotated for large-scale structured data. This dataset underpins two case studies: the first investigates voting-related claims using the Vote semantic frame, while the second explores various semantic frames based on data sources from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of frame semantics in improving evidence retrieval and explainability for fact-checking. Finally, we conducted a survey of frames evoked in fact-checked claims, identifying high-impact frames to guide future work in this direction.

  Open-domain semantic parsing remains a challenging task, as neural models often rely on heuristics and struggle to handle unseen concepts. In this paper, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for this task and introduce Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP), a simple yet effective approach that integrates external symbolic knowledge into the parsing process. Our experiments not only show that LLMs outperform previous encoder-decoder baselines for semantic parsing, but that RASP further enhances their ability to predict unseen concepts, nearly doubling the performance of previous models on out-of-distribution concepts. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging large language models and retrieval mechanisms for robust and open-domain semantic parsing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Faced with an expensive human annotation process, creators of NLP systems increasingly turn to synthetic data generation. While this method shows promise, the extent to which synthetic data can replace human annotation is poorly understood. We investigate the use of synthetic data in Fact Verification (FV) and Question Answering (QA) by studying the effects of incrementally replacing human generated data with synthetic points on eight diverse datasets. Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be reliably improved by including as few as 125 human generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of just a little additional human data (only 200 points) requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data and estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution. Our results suggest that even when human annotation at scale is infeasible, there is great value to having a small proportion of the dataset being human generated.

  Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet their ability to handle long documents is constrained by computational limitations. Traditional approaches, such as truncating inputs, sparse self-attention, and chunking, attempt to mitigate these issues, but they often lead to information loss and hinder the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce ChuLo, a novel chunk representation method for long document understanding that addresses these limitations. Our ChuLo groups input tokens using unsupervised keyphrase extraction, emphasizing semantically important keyphrase based chunks to retain core document content while reducing input length. This approach minimizes information loss and improves the efficiency of Transformer-based models. Preserving all tokens in long document understanding, especially token classification tasks, is important to ensure that fine-grained annotations, which depend on the entire sequence context, are not lost. We evaluate our method on multiple long document classification tasks and long document token classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis.

  Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods.

  Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without the need for expensive human annotations. However, existing methods often generate data that can be low quality or contrived. In this paper, we introduce Source2Synth, a scalable approach for synthetic data generation and curation that is grounded in real-world data sources. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data examples with intermediate reasoning steps. Our method improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two tasks that leverage two different types of data: multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where we test complex reasoning abilities leveraging documents, and tabular question answering (TQA), where we test tool usage leveraging tables. Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotpotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.

  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have dramatically advanced the research field and delivered powerful vision-language understanding capabilities. However, these models often inherit deep-rooted social biases from their training data, leading to uncomfortable responses with respect to attributes such as race and gender. This paper addresses the issue of social biases in MLLMs by i) introducing a comprehensive counterfactual dataset with multiple social concepts (CMSC), which complements existing datasets by providing 18 diverse and balanced social concepts; and ii) proposing a counter-stereotype debiasing (CSD) strategy that mitigates social biases in MLLMs by leveraging the opposites of prevalent stereotypes. CSD incorporates both a novel bias-aware data sampling method and a loss rescaling method, enabling the model to effectively reduce biases. We conduct extensive experiments with four prevalent MLLM architectures. The results demonstrate the advantage of the CMSC dataset and the edge of CSD strategy in reducing social biases compared to existing competing methods, without compromising the overall performance on general multi-modal reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in human-level reasoning and generation capabilities, which encourages extensive research on their application in mathematical problem solving. However, current work has been largely focused on text-based mathematical problems, with limited investigation in problems involving geometric information. Addressing this gap, we aim to enable LLMs to solve geometric problems by understanding image input. We first analyze the limitations of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this area: they struggle to accurately comprehending basic geometric elements and their relationships. To overcome these challenges, we take advantage of the unique characteristics of geometric problems (such as unique geometric logical form, and geometric scalability) and the capacity of the textual LLMs to build an enriched multimodal geometry dataset based on existing data. The augmented dataset, Geo170K, contains more than 170K geometric image-caption and question-answer pairs. Utilizing our constructed Geo170K dataset, we develop G-LLaVA, which demonstrates exceptional performance in solving geometric problems, significantly outperforming GPT-4-V on the MathVista benchmark with only 7B parameters.

  The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization. To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention, which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme. Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

  Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution, segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends. Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2 diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with type 2 diabetes.Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13 morphological features were significantly different between patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas measurements than CT using our AI-based method.Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and 675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a clinical setting.

  Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce. To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning, eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and addresses the lack of labeled events.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets, injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal. The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination harmonization and editing.

  The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs, including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

  _Canyu Zhao, Xiaoman Li, Tianjian Feng, Zhiyue Zhao, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing. Project webpage:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks, the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general solution for clinical registration without additional training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement, crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.

  _Zhichao Li, Arren Glover, Chiara Bartolozzi, Lorenzo Natale_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range, that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

  _Fabian Holst, Emre G√ºlsoylu, Simone Frintrop_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods (homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation. Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for ship detection from the same scene.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras, and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of training a neural ISP. Link to project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical robotics.

  _Jiaxin Wei, Stefan Leutenegger, Simon Schaefer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile, diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available. Project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results, inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this, we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events: (4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from severely blurred inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps (DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

  Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and temporal stability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.

  Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models (SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity, the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.

  Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure, necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and autonomous monitoring applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and track IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and LiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the OpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties, leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models. Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework, coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation (CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance (FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510. Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

  _Yonghan Shin, SeungKyu Kim, Won-Ki Jeong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

  The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows. Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently, Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions. Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions. Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance, particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely through semantic instructions.

  State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.

  Weed management represents a critical challenge in agriculture, significantly impacting crop yields and requiring substantial resources for control. Effective weed monitoring and analysis strategies are crucial for implementing sustainable agricultural practices and site-specific management approaches. We introduce WeedSense, a novel multi-task learning architecture for comprehensive weed analysis that jointly performs semantic segmentation, height estimation, and growth stage classification. We present a unique dataset capturing 16 weed species over an 11-week growth cycle with pixel-level annotations, height measurements, and temporal labels. WeedSense leverages a dual-path encoder incorporating Universal Inverted Bottleneck blocks and a Multi-Task Bifurcated Decoder with transformer-based feature fusion to generate multi-scale features and enable simultaneous prediction across multiple tasks. WeedSense outperforms other state-of-the-art models on our comprehensive evaluation. On our multi-task dataset, WeedSense achieves mIoU of 89.78% for segmentation, 1.67cm MAE for height estimation, and 99.99% accuracy for growth stage classification while maintaining real-time inference at 160 FPS. Our multitask approach achieves 3$\times$ faster inference than sequential single-task execution and uses 32.4% fewer parameters. Please see our project page atthis http URL.

  We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge, we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency.

  The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4 hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen environments.

  With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided, subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Our approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods. We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

  A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore, we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth, and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI, NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat, highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios.

  Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts. However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the frontier of controllable image synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However, balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for dense prediction.FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images. This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands, which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets, achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

  _Bing Han, Yuhua Huang, Pan Gao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process. Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty, alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir√© patterns that severely degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir√©ing models have been proposed to remove such moir√© patterns, these approaches still suffer from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii) channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across frames. We address these issues with the Moir√© Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled Moir√© Adaptive Demoir√©ing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir√©ing (STAD). DMAD separates moir√© and content via a Moir√© Decoupling Block (MDB) and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir√©-adaptive features using a Moir√© Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze moir√© characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

  _Yue Gong, Shanyuan Liu, Liuzhuozheng Li, Jian Zhu, Bo Cheng, Liebucha Wu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets. Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities. Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges. Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR, a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series, delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW, reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing criticalthis http URLwith the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA) representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.

  Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research. However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive, labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN, which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research in vision-based biomedical analysis.

  _Dian Ning, Dong Seog Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union (IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper, we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study: (1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance. We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6% in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without any additional hyperparameter tuning.

  Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.

  We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

  Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively. OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention variants attained similar performance. Source code is available atthis https URL

  Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally, prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI) framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training, our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object recognition. The code will be made available online.

  3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity, yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings. This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

  Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis, using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance, and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic, localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data augmentation in dental AI workflows.

  The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures -- ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms, CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

However, these models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

  Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data. In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the regular GCN.

  Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields, we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection, including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to real-world deployment.

  Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision, and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available atthis https URL.

  We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture, RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding, object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data. Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks.

  Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available 3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to 5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more generalizable Segment Anything models.

  We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, and 270¬∞. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0¬∞) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180¬∞) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90¬∞ and 270¬∞. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90¬∞ and 270¬∞ rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180¬∞ images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.

  Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2) the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future FIQA researchthis https URL.

  Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities, the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity, achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap. Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

  The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

  Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

  Foundation models in medical imaging have shown promising label efficiency, achieving high performance on downstream tasks using only a fraction of the annotated data otherwise required. In this study, we evaluate this potential in the context of prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a recently developed domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI datasets. We investigate the impact of variable image quality on the label-efficient finetuning, by quantifying the generalisability of the finetuned models. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments by systematically varying the ratios of high- and low-quality images in the finetuning and evaluation sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate cancer detection. Importantly, experimental results also show that, although finetuning requires significantly less labeled data compared to training from scratch when the quality ratio is consistent, this label efficiency is not independent of the image quality distribution. For example, we show cases that, without sufficient high-quality images in finetuning, finetuned models may fail to outperform those without pretraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

  Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

  Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

  Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6% / +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution (target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution. We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'', or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

  Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet 50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs. FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19) with a 400% compression ratio. Furthermore, our highest compression model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768, outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

The best performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision. We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the dataset with different labels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators (FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion) parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of tokens for both.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.

  Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation by enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a significant advance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves an accuracy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on the anomaly detection task. The approach requires only 1 million parameters while surpassing the current baselines.

  Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}: Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline, guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation, facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL) from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is criti-cal for ensuring the reliability of semantic segmentation models, particularly in complex road environments where safety and accuracy are paramount. Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, which significantly enhanced multimodal reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, the application of CoT-based visual reasoning for OOD semantic segmentation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, through extensive analyses of the road scene anomalies, we identify three challenging scenarios where current state-of-the-art OOD segmentation methods consistently struggle: (1) densely packed and overlapping objects, (2) distant scenes with small objects, and (3) large foreground-dominant objects. To address the presented challenges, we propose a novel CoT-based framework targeting OOD detection in road anomaly scenes. Our method leverages the extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of foundation models, such as GPT-4, to enhance OOD detection through improved image understanding and prompt-based reasoning aligned with observed problematic scene attributes. Extensive experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both standard benchmarks and our newly defined challenging subset of the RoadAnomaly dataset, offering a robust and interpretable solution for OOD semantic segmentation in complex driving environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is challenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to issues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Capsule endoscopy is a method to capture images of the gastrointestinal tract and screen for diseases which might remain hidden if investigated with standard endoscopes. Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models directly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and thus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of available data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective anomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address this challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies, requiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the training and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly effective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased computational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world applications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each individual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the anomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on the two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images, the Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on the Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our approach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters across all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial intelligence into capsule endoscopies.

  Despite the remarkable success, recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) methods via diffusion modeling still involve fine-grained noise-strength tuning and computationally expensive multi-step denoising, leading to a fundamental tension between fidelity and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel inversion-based AD approach - detection via noising in latent space - which circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing detection via denoising in RGB space paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we only enforce very few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analysis across three widely used image AD datasets under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, regarding state-of-the-art AD performance, and about 2 times inference time speedup without diffusion distillation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a multi-view collaborative matching strategy for reliable track construction in complex scenarios. We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks. Extensive experiments on various complex scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over the mainstream two-view matching paradigm.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.

  Accurate depth and camera pose estimation is essential for achieving high-quality 3D visualisations in robotic-assisted surgery. Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.

  We introduce DuCos, a novel depth super-resolution framework grounded in Lagrangian duality theory, offering a flexible integration of multiple constraints and reconstruction objectives to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our DuCos is the first to significantly improve generalization across diverse scenarios with foundation models as prompts. The prompt design consists of two key components: Correlative Fusion (CF) and Gradient Regulation (GR). CF facilitates precise geometric alignment and effective fusion between prompt and depth features, while GR refines depth predictions by enforcing consistency with sharp-edged depth maps derived from foundation models. Crucially, these prompts are seamlessly embedded into the Lagrangian constraint term, forming a synergistic and principled framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuCos outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

  High-fidelity text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but their widespread use raises significant ethical concerns, including intellectual property protection and the misuse of synthetic media. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generatedthis http URL, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality.

  Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) methods have made remarkable progress, with most existing HMER approaches based on either a hybrid CNN/RNN-based with GRU architecture or Transformer architectures. Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses. Leveraging different model structures as viewers and effectively integrating their diverse capabilities presents an intriguing avenue for exploration. This involves addressing two key challenges: 1) How to fuse these two methods effectively, and 2) How to achieve higher performance under an appropriate level of complexity. This paper proposes an efficient CNN-Transformer multi-viewer, multi-task approach to enhance the model's recognition performance. Our MMHMER model achieves 63.96%, 62.51%, and 65.46% ExpRate on CROHME14, CROHME16, and CROHME19, outperforming Posformer with an absolute gain of 1.28%, 1.48%, and 0.58%. The main contribution of our approach is that we propose a new multi-view, multi-task framework that can effectively integrate the strengths of CNN and Transformer. By leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the sequence modeling capabilities of Transformer, our model can better handle the complexity of handwritten mathematical expressions.

  Identifying individual animals within large wildlife populations is essential for effective wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. Recent advancements in computer vision have shown promise in animal re-identification (Animal ReID) by leveraging data from camera traps. However, existing Animal ReID datasets rely exclusively on visual data, overlooking environmental metadata that ecologists have identified as highly correlated with animal behavior and identity, such as temperature and circadian rhythms. Moreover, the emergence of multimodal models capable of jointly processing visual and textual data presents new opportunities for Animal ReID, but existing datasets fail to leverage these models' text-processing capabilities, limiting their full potential. Additionally, to facilitate the use of metadata in existing ReID methods, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module that can be incorporated into existing vision-language model (VLM)-based Animal ReID methods, allowing ReID models to leverage both environmental metadata and visual information to improve ReID performance. Experiments on MetaWild show that combining baseline ReID models with MFA to incorporate metadata consistently improves performance compared to using visual information alone, validating the effectiveness of incorporating metadata in re-identification. We hope that our proposed dataset can inspire further exploration of multimodal approaches for Animal ReID.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-modal contrastive distillation has recently been explored for learning effective 3D representations. However, existing methods focus primarily on modality-shared features, neglecting the modality-specific features during the pre-training process, which leads to suboptimal representations. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the limitations of current contrastive methods for 3D representation learning and propose a new framework, namely CMCR, to address these shortcomings. Our approach improves upon traditional methods by better integrating both modality-shared and modality-specific features. Specifically, we introduce masked image modeling and occupancy estimation tasks to guide the network in learning more comprehensive modality-specific features. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal unified codebook that learns an embedding space shared across different modalities. Besides, we introduce geometry-enhanced masked image modeling to further boost 3D representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method mitigates the challenges faced by traditional approaches and consistently outperforms existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces UnZipLoRA, a method for decomposing an image into its constituent subject and style, represented as two distinct LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations). Unlike existing personalization techniques that focus on either subject or style in isolation, or require separate training sets for each, UnZipLoRA disentangles these elements from a single image by training both the LoRAs simultaneously. UnZipLoRA ensures that the resulting LoRAs are compatible, i.e., they can be seamlessly combined using direct addition. UnZipLoRA enables independent manipulation and recontextualization of subject and style, including generating variations of each, applying the extracted style to new subjects, and recombining them to reconstruct the original image or create novel variations. To address the challenge of subject and style entanglement, UnZipLoRA employs a novel prompt separation technique, as well as column and block separation strategies to accurately preserve the characteristics of subject and style, and ensure compatibility between the learned LoRAs. Evaluation with human studies and quantitative metrics demonstrates UnZipLoRA's effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including DreamBooth-LoRA, Inspiration Tree, and B-LoRA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-duration talking video synthesis faces persistent challenges in simultaneously achieving high video quality, portrait and temporal consistency, and computational efficiency. As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, loss of identity consistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly prominent, severely impacting the realism and reliability of generated results. To address these issues, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework that incorporates multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient long-duration talking video generation. Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have been demonstrated with undesired generation due to unfiltered large-scale training data, such as sexual images and copyrights, necessitating the erasure of undesired concepts. Most existing methods focus on modifying the generation probabilities conditioned on the texts containing target concepts. However, they fail to guarantee the desired generation of texts unseen in the training phase, especially for the adversarial texts from malicious attacks. In this paper, we analyze the erasure task and point out that existing methods cannot guarantee the minimization of the total probabilities of undesired generation. To tackle this problem, we propose Dark Miner. It entails a recurring three-stage process that comprises mining, verifying, and circumventing. This method greedily mines embeddings with maximum generation probabilities of target concepts and more effectively reduces their generation. In the experiments, we evaluate its performance on the inappropriateness, object, and style concepts. Compared with the previous methods, our method achieves better erasure and defense results, especially under multiple adversarial attacks, while preserving the native generation capability of the models. Our code will be available on GitHub.

  This paper presents VisioPhysioENet, a novel multimodal system that leverages visual and physiological signals to detect learner engagement. It employs a two-level approach for extracting both visual and physiological features. For visual feature extraction, Dlib is used to detect facial landmarks, while OpenCV provides additional estimations. The face recognition library, built on Dlib, is used to identify the facial region of interest specifically for physiological signal extraction. Physiological signals are then extracted using the plane-orthogonal-toskin method to assess cardiovascular activity. These features are integrated using advanced machine learning classifiers, enhancing the detection of various levels of engagement. We thoroughly tested VisioPhysioENet on the DAiSEE dataset. It achieved an accuracy of 63.09%. This shows it can better identify different levels of engagement compared to many existing methods. It performed 8.6% better than the only other model that uses both physiological and visual features.

  Human body actions are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions. This paper specifically focuses on a subset of body actions known as micro-actions, which are subtle, low-intensity body movements with promising applications in human emotion analysis. In real-world scenarios, human micro-actions often temporally co-occur, with multiple micro-actions overlapping in time, such as concurrent head and hand movements. However, current research primarily focuses on recognizing individual micro-actions while overlooking their co-occurring nature. To address this gap, we propose a new task named Multi-label Micro-Action Detection (MMAD), which involves identifying all micro-actions in a given short video, determining their start and end times, and categorizing them. Accomplishing this requires a model capable of accurately capturing both long-term and short-term action relationships to detect multiple overlapping micro-actions. To facilitate the MMAD task, we introduce a new dataset named Multi-label Micro-Action-52 (MMA-52) and propose a baseline method equipped with a dual-path spatial-temporal adapter to address the challenges of subtle visual change in MMAD. We hope that MMA-52 can stimulate research on micro-action analysis in videos and prompt the development of spatio-temporal modeling in human-centric video understanding. The proposed MMA-52 dataset is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and most existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper establishes a formal information-theoretic framework for image captioning, conceptualizing captions as compressed linguistic representations that selectively encode semantic units in images. Our framework posits that good image captions should balance three key aspects: informationally sufficient, minimally redundant, and readily comprehensible by humans. By formulating these aspects as quantitative measures with adjustable weights, our framework provides a flexible foundation for analyzing and optimizing image captioning systems across diverse task requirements. To demonstrate its applicability, we introduce the Pyramid of Captions (PoCa) method, which generates enriched captions by integrating local and global visual information. We present both theoretical proof that PoCa improves caption quality under certain assumptions, and empirical validation of its effectiveness across various image captioning models and datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deepfakes have recently raised significant trust issues and security concerns among the public. Compared to CNN face forgery detectors, ViT-based methods take advantage of the expressivity of transformers, achieving superior detection performance. However, these approaches still exhibit the following limitations: (1) Fully fine-tuning ViT-based models from ImageNet weights demands substantial computational and storage resources; (2) ViT-based methods struggle to capture local forgery clues, leading to model bias; (3) These methods limit their scope on only one or few face forgery features, resulting in limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this work introduces Mixture-of-Experts modules for Face Forgery Detection (MoE-FFD), a generalized yet parameter-efficient ViT-based approach. MoE-FFD only updates lightweight Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Adapter layers while keeping the ViT backbone frozen, thereby achieving parameter-efficient training. Moreover, MoE-FFD leverages the expressivity of transformers and local priors of CNNs to simultaneously extract global and local forgery clues. Additionally, novel MoE modules are designed to scale the model's capacity and smartly select optimal forgery experts, further enhancing forgery detection performance. Our proposed learning scheme can be seamlessly adapted to various transformer backbones in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art face forgery detection performance with significantly reduced parameter overhead.

  Given 2D point correspondences between an image pair, inferring the camera motion is a fundamental issue in the computer vision community. The existing works generally set out from the epipolar constraint and estimate the essential matrix, which is not optimal in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense. In this paper, we dive into the original measurement model with respect to the rotation matrix and normalized translation vector and formulate the ML problem. We then propose a two-step algorithm to solve it: In the first step, we estimate the variance of measurement noises and devise a consistent estimator based on bias elimination; In the second step, we execute a one-step Gauss-Newton iteration on manifold to refine the consistent estimate. We prove that the proposed estimate owns the same asymptotic statistical properties as the ML estimate: The first is consistency, i.e., the estimate converges to the ground truth as the point number increases; The second is asymptotic efficiency, i.e., the mean squared error of the estimate converges to the theoretical lower bound -- Cramer-Rao bound. In addition, we show that our algorithm has linear time complexity. These appealing characteristics endow our estimator with a great advantage in the case of dense point correspondences. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that when the point number reaches the order of hundreds, our estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of estimation accuracy and CPU time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework for enhancing 3D perception in autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, our approach, namely NCLR, focuses on 2D-3D neural calibration, a novel pretext task that estimates the rigid pose aligning camera and LiDAR coordinate systems. First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching. Second, we identify the overlapping area between the image and point cloud with the fused features. Third, we establish dense 2D-3D correspondences to estimate the rigid pose. The framework not only learns fine-grained matching from points to pixels but also achieves alignment of the image and point cloud at a holistic level, understanding the LiDAR-to-camera extrinsic parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of NCLR by applying the pre-trained backbone to downstream tasks, such as LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation, object detection, and panoptic segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets illustrate the superiority of NCLR over existing self-supervised methods. The results confirm that joint learning from different modalities significantly enhances the network's understanding abilities and effectiveness of learned representation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online, value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning but adapted to TD learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges: effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets; they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness. We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs. Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately predicting enzyme functionality remains one of the major challenges in computational biology, particularly for enzymes with limited structural annotations or sequence homology. We present a novel multimodal Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC) classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities: protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other QML models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models, each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However, the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data. However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach, named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA), that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework, which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field. The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of manual annotation projects across various fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and effective model compression.

  Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities: molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

  Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less graphs.

MissionHD uses an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

  In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns. Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for future research. The benchmark code is available at:this https URL.

  In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently, various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender. Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.

  Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.

  Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization. However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex. These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively. In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data points and outperforms strong baselines.

  Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using Poincar√© embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar√© embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar√© embeddings resulted in modest and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models, particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar√© embedding, showed enhanced calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across configurations.Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical knowledge.

  Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI) framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores, were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying operational conditions.

  The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However, there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further research to enhance their reliability.

  The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

  Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention, as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions -- and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision, enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed, covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios, and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior capability in complex cloud environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features, severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only, capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic) M√∂bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable, axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions generated by structured probabilistic models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making. Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations. For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations. However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

  _Alexander Geiger, Lars Wagner, Daniel Rueckert, Dirk Wilhelm, Alissa Jell_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge, particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline choices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms. However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packagesthis http URLand TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate ofthis http URLfrom 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%. Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

  Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring, yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy (e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility (median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes, showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on individual responses to lifestyle changes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models. We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on two different datasets.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g., cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care.

  _Junwei Su, Shan Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization, with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space. This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns, significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

  Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

  Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However, existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed, highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk (generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions, \emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and selection in practice.}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance for mobile devices.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches.

- **[Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313)**  `arXiv:2508.14313`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.

  There is an increasing appreciation that one may need to consider multiple measures of fairness, e.g., considering multiple group and individual fairness notions. The relative weights of the fairness regularisers are a priori unknown, may be time varying, and need to be learned on the fly. We consider the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures with limited graph-structured feedback.

  Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive, prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality. Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics. Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary predictors or adding any inference overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust in performance across different training and architecture settings.

  The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost, functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization. Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically, ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet, a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST) mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer computations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations, this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

  _Xin Wu, Fei Teng, Ji Zhang, Xingwang Li, Yuxuan Liang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps, mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142 and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping scientific discovery, evolving from specialized computational tools into autonomous research partners. We position Agentic Science as a pivotal stage within the broader AI for Science paradigm, where AI systems progress from partial assistance to full scientific agency. Enabled by large language models (LLMs), multimodal systems, and integrated research platforms, agentic AI shows capabilities in hypothesis generation, experimental design, execution, analysis, and iterative refinement -- behaviors once regarded as uniquely human. This survey provides a domain-oriented review of autonomous scientific discovery across life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics. We unify three previously fragmented perspectives -- process-oriented, autonomy-oriented, and mechanism-oriented -- through a comprehensive framework that connects foundational capabilities, core processes, and domain-specific realizations. Building on this framework, we (i) trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities underpinning scientific agency, (iii) model discovery as a dynamic four-stage workflow, (iv) review applications across the above domains, and (v) synthesize key challenges and future opportunities. This work establishes a domain-oriented synthesis of autonomous scientific discovery and positions Agentic Science as a structured paradigm for advancing AI-driven research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains, including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance. Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

  Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training: prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks when using GRPO.

  Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines (pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable, expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

  While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large models often incurred high computational costs during both training and inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases. In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight. These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current FMs. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI. This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for \underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently received considerable attention across various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher. Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP), a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model (MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets. Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models, traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC, characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image. Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning. We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal systems for complex real-world scenarios.

  Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size, and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these design choices influence generalization remains an open question with significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3 adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date. While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising research directions and offering practical guidance.

  This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck. Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

  Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

  This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants, including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000 customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the observed improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide, leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning (ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE) on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration, GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

  _Rapheal Huang, Weilong Guo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

  _Frederik L. Dennig, Daniel A. Keim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy (DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this, the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1 percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of 14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for 180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality. Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements, potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

  _Andrew Gracyk_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We offer a theoretical mathematical background to Transformers through Lagrangian optimization across the token space. The Transformer, as a flow map, exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts, we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding, oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the Transformer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing attention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models while keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients, ensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often employed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global model. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not always yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The reason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which, while being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for the knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous Federated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature information via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous models better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge distillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to maintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align the features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize the projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and thus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  Satellite remote sensing enables a wide range of downstream applications, including habitat mapping, carbon accounting, and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. However, satellite time series are voluminous and often corrupted, making them challenging to use. We present TESSERA, an open, global, land-oriented remote sensing foundation model that uses self-supervised learning to generate `ready-to-use' embeddings at 10~m scale from pixel-level satellite time-series data. TESSERA uses two encoders to combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10~m resolution to create embeddings that are fused with a multilayer perceptron to create annual global embedding maps. We compare our work with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models in five diverse downstream tasks and find that TESSERA closely matches or outperforms these baselines. We believe that TESSERA's ease of use, state-of-the-art performance, openness, and computation- and labelled data-efficiency will prove transformative in a wide range of ecological applications.

  _Yajie Zhou, Xiaoyi Pang, Zhibo Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous environments in the real world.

  _Quan Nguyen, Thanh Nguyen-Tang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but powerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively applying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to largest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are not sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited small model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large model, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore propose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of small and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy for the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence to enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to improve post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves cascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy model to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the proposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding improvements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in deferrals to more costly models.

  Recently, neural networks have gained attention for creating parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections. Parametric projections allow for embedding previously unseen data without recomputing the projection as a whole, while invertible projections enable the generation of new data points. However, these properties have never been explored simultaneously for arbitrary projection methods. We evaluate three autoencoder (AE) architectures for creating parametric and invertible projections. Based on a given projection, we train AEs to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping into the original space. We perform a quantitative and qualitative comparison on four datasets of varying dimensionality and pattern complexity using t-SNE. Our results indicate that AEs with a customized loss function can create smoother parametric and inverse projections than feed-forward neural networks while giving users control over the strength of the smoothing effect.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have provided new opportunities for decision-making, particularly in the task of automated feature selection. In this paper, we first comprehensively evaluate LLM-based feature selection methods, covering the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4.5. Then, we propose a new hybrid strategy called LLM4FS that integrates LLMs with traditional data-driven methods. Specifically, input data samples into LLMs, and directly call traditional data-driven techniques such as random forest and forward sequential selection. Notably, our analysis reveals that the hybrid strategy leverages the contextual understanding of LLMs and the high statistical reliability of traditional data-driven methods to achieve excellent feature selection performance, even surpassing LLMs and traditional data-driven methods. Finally, we point out the limitations of its application in decision-making. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  In the field of sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), deep neural networks provide advanced technical support. Many studies have proven that recognition accuracy can be improved by increasing the depth or width of the network. However, for wearable devices, the balance between network performance and resource consumption is crucial. With minimum resource consumption as the basic principle, we propose a universal attention feature purification mechanism, called MSAP, which is suitable for multi-scale networks. The mechanism effectively solves the feature redundancy caused by the superposition of multi-scale features by means of inter-scale attention screening and connection method. In addition, we have designed a network correction module that integrates seamlessly between layers of individual network modules to mitigate inherent problems in deep networks. We also built an embedded deployment system that is in line with the current level of wearable technology to test the practical feasibility of the HAR model, and further prove the efficiency of the method. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that the proposed method model effectively reduces redundant features in filtered data and provides excellent performance with little resource consumption.

  We explore the low-rank structure of the weight matrices in neural networks at the stationary points (limiting solutions of optimization algorithms) with $L2$ regularization (also known as weight decay). We show several properties of such deep neural networks, induced by $L2$ regularization. In particular, for a stationary point we show alignment of the parameters and the gradient, norm preservation across layers, and low-rank bias: properties previously known in the context of solution of gradient descent/flow type algorithms. Experiments show that the assumptions made in the analysis only mildly affect the observations.In addition, we investigate a multitask learning phenomenon enabled by $L2$ regularization and low-rank bias. In particular, we show that if two networks are trained, such that the inputs in the training set of one network are approximately orthogonal to the inputs in the training set of the other network, the new network obtained by simply summing the weights of the two networks will perform as well on both training sets as the respective individual networks. We demonstrate this for shallow ReLU neural networks trained by gradient descent, as well as deep linear networks trained by gradient flow.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative approach for generative modeling over discrete domains. Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Growing evidence suggests that the brain uses an attention schema, or a simplified model of attention, to help control what it attends to. One proposed benefit of this model is to allow agents to model the attention states of other agents, and thus predict and interact with other agents. The effects of an attention schema may be examined in artificial agents. Although attention mechanisms in artificial agents are different from in biological brains, there may be some principles in common. In both cases, select features or representations are emphasized for better performance. Here, using neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, we asked whether the addition of an attention schema affected the ability of agents to make judgements about and cooperate with each other. First, we found that an agent with an attention schema is better at categorizing the attention states of other agents (higher accuracy). Second, an agent with an attention schema develops a pattern of attention that is easier for other agents to categorize. Third, in a joint task where two agents must predict each other to paint a scene together, adding an attention schema improves performance. Finally, the performance improvements are not caused by a general increase in network complexity. Instead, improvement is specific to tasks involving judging, categorizing, or predicting the attention of other agents. These results support the hypothesis that an attention schema has computational properties beneficial to mutual interpretability and interactive behavior. We speculate that the same principles might pertain to biological attention and attention schemas in people.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), spectral GNNs have received increasing popularity by virtue of their ability to retrieve graph signals in the spectral domain. These models feature uniqueness in efficient computation as well as rich expressiveness, which stems from advanced management and profound understanding of graph data. However, few systematic studies have been conducted to assess spectral GNNs, particularly in benchmarking their efficiency, memory consumption, and effectiveness in a unified and fair manner. There is also a pressing need to select spectral models suitable for learning specific graph data and deploying them to massive web-scale graphs, which is currently constrained by the varied model designs and training settings.In this work, we extensively benchmark spectral GNNs with a focus on the spectral perspective, demystifying them as spectral graph filters. We analyze and categorize 35 GNNs with 27 corresponding filters, spanning diverse formulations and utilizations of the graph data. Then, we implement the filters within a unified spectral-oriented framework with dedicated graph computations and efficient training schemes. In particular, our implementation enables the deployment of spectral GNNs over million-scale graphs and various tasks with comparable performance and less overhead. Thorough experiments are conducted on the graph filters with comprehensive metrics on effectiveness and efficiency, offering novel observations and practical guidelines that are only available from our evaluations across graph scales. Different from the prevailing belief, our benchmark reveals an intricate landscape regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of spectral graph filters, demonstrating the potential to achieve desirable performance through tailored spectral manipulation of graph data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in logical reasoning, in-context learning, and code generation. However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growth of large language models underscores the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Despite its popularity, LoRA encounters storage and computational challenges when deploying multiple task- or user-specific modules. To address this, we introduce LoRA-XS, a novel fine-tuning method backed by a theoretical derivation. LoRA-XS drastically reduces trainable parameters by incorporating a small, trainable weight matrix between frozen low-rank matrices derived from the Singular Value Decomposition of pre-trained weights. This design enables LoRA-XS to reduce storage requirements by over 100x in 7B models compared to LoRA. Additionally, unlike other methods, LoRA-XS imposes no lower bound on trainable parameters - it can scale from a single parameter per module to arbitrarily large values, adapting to any storage or computational constraint. Evaluations on GLUE, GSM8K, MATH, and commonsense reasoning benchmarks across different model scales reveal that LoRA-XS consistently outperforms or matches LoRA and VeRA in accuracy, offering unmatched parameter efficiency. Our ablation studies highlight the significance of singular vectors in transformer weights, establishing LoRA-XS as a powerful, storage-efficient solution for scaling and personalizing large language models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While machine learning algorithms hold promise for personalised medicine, their clinical adoption remains limited, partly due to biases that can compromise the reliability of predictions. In this paper, we focus on sample selection bias (SSB), a specific type of bias where the study population is less representative of the target population, leading to biased and potentially harmful decisions. Despite being well-known in the literature, SSB remains scarcely studied in machine learning for healthcare. Moreover, the existing machine learning techniques try to correct the bias mostly by balancing distributions between the study and the target populations, which may result in a loss of predictive performance. To address these problems, our study illustrates the potential risks associated with SSB by examining SSB's impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms. Most importantly, we propose a new research direction for addressing SSB, based on the target population identification rather than the bias correction. Specifically, we propose two independent networks(T-Net) and a multitasking network (MT-Net) for addressing SSB, where one network/task identifies the target subpopulation which is representative of the study population and the second makes predictions for the identified subpopulation. Our empirical results with synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets highlight that SSB can lead to a large drop in the performance of an algorithm for the target population as compared with the study population, as well as a substantial difference in the performance for the target subpopulations that are representative of the selected and the non-selected patients from the study population. Furthermore, our proposed techniques demonstrate robustness across various settings, including different dataset sizes, event rates, and selection rates, outperforming the existing bias correction techniques.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine Learning (ML) has revolutionized various domains, offering predictive capabilities in several areas. However, with the increasing accessibility of ML tools, many practitioners, lacking deep ML expertise, adopt a "push the button" approach, utilizing user-friendly interfaces without a thorough understanding of underlying algorithms. While this approach provides convenience, it raises concerns about the reliability of outcomes, leading to challenges such as incorrect performance evaluation. This paper addresses a critical issue in ML, known as data leakage, where unintended information contaminates the training data, impacting model performance evaluation. Users, due to a lack of understanding, may inadvertently overlook crucial steps, leading to optimistic performance estimates that may not hold in real-world scenarios. The discrepancy between evaluated and actual performance on new data is a significant concern. In particular, this paper categorizes data leakage in ML, discussing how certain conditions can propagate through the ML workflow. Furthermore, it explores the connection between data leakage and the specific task being addressed, investigates its occurrence in Transfer Learning, and compares standard inductive ML with transductive ML frameworks. The conclusion summarizes key findings, emphasizing the importance of addressing data leakage for robust and reliable ML applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, a radiomics approach was extended to optical fluorescence molecular imaging data for tissue classification, termed 'optomics'. Fluorescence molecular imaging is emerging for precise surgical guidance during head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) resection. However, the tumor-to-normal tissue contrast is confounded by intrinsic physiological limitations of heterogeneous expression of the target molecule, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Optomics seek to improve tumor identification by probing textural pattern differences in EGFR expression conveyed by fluorescence. A total of 1,472 standardized optomic features were extracted from fluorescence image samples. A supervised machine learning pipeline involving a support vector machine classifier was trained with 25 top-ranked features selected by minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion. Model predictive performance was compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method by classifying testing set image patches of resected tissue with histologically confirmed malignancy status. The optomics approach provided consistent improvement in prediction accuracy on all test set samples, irrespective of dose, compared to fluorescence intensity thresholding method (mean accuracies of 89% vs. 81%; P = 0.0072). The improved performance demonstrates that extending the radiomics approach to fluorescence molecular imaging data offers a promising image analysis technique for cancer detection in fluorescence-guided surgery.

  We propose an improved algorithm by identifying and encouraging cooperative behavior in multi-agent environments. First, we analyze the shortcomings of existing algorithms in addressing multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. Then, based on the existing algorithm MADDPG, we introduce a new parameter to increase the reward that an agent can obtain when cooperative behavior among agents is identified. Finally, we compare our improved algorithm with MADDPG in environments from PettingZoo. The results show that the new algorithm helps agents achieve both higher team rewards and individual rewards.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In high-density environments where numerous autonomous agents move simultaneously in a distributed manner, streamlining global flows to mitigate local congestion is crucial to maintain overall navigation efficiency. This paper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path planning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function, defined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a flow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows steeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition that congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from different directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level, time-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their own local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two solvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small instances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which quickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively refines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting state-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces local congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and continuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the performance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics and autonomous-vehicle operations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots. For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's actions which we validate through a user study.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency. The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its application in a variety of real-world settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world monitoring scenarios.

  The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor, prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and architectural improvements.

  Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks. To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance. In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments. Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.

The planner, augmented by environment, balancing environmental exploration, target tracking precision, and energy efficiency. Physical experiments demonstrate 81% tracking error reduction, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift across indoor maze and 60-meter-scale outdoor scenarios. This work proposes a hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, offering a robust solution for UAV autonomy in post-disaster search and rescue missions.

  This technical report presents the champion solution of the Table Service Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a series of demanding tasks under strict requirements for speed, precision, and reliability: unfolding a tablecloth (deformable-object manipulation), placing a pizza onto the table (pick-and-place), and opening and closing a food container with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the first place in the competition.

  Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics. Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

  We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning. When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}. Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints. Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner with minor delays as a trade-off.

  Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications. In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints. Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency.

  LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both robustness and accuracy.

  This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles. During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts, object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions, achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance on our project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths. The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots, as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP) framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid loco-manipulation problem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical, these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands, efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies: Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45¬∞). Despite improvements, limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and computational optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field.

  _Jiming Ren, Xuan Lin, Roman Mineyev, Karen M. Feigh, Samuel Coogan, Ye Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems, which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion, introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present 3D FlowMatch Actor (3DFA), a 3D policy architecture for robot manipulation that combines flow matching for trajectory prediction with 3D pretrained visual scene representations for learning from demonstration. 3DFA leverages 3D relative attention between action and visual tokens during action denoising, building on prior work in 3D diffusion-based single-arm policy learning. Through a combination of flow matching and targeted system-level and architectural optimizations, 3DFA achieves over 30x faster training and inference than previous 3D diffusion-based policies, without sacrificing performance. On the bimanual PerAct2 benchmark, it establishes a new state of the art, outperforming the next-best method by an absolute margin of 41.4%. In extensive real-world evaluations, it surpasses strong baselines with up to 1000x more parameters and significantly more pretraining. In unimanual settings, it sets a new state of the art on 74 RLBench tasks by directly predicting dense end-effector trajectories, eliminating the need for motion planning. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the importance of our design choices for both policy effectiveness and efficiency.

  Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD) systems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines, end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments, with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla. A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm, which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon, goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving pose critical challenges, as planners often fail to generalize beyond their training experience, leading to unsafe or unexpected behavior. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in handling such scenarios by providing high-level scene understanding and user-aligned decisions. However, existing VLMs often exhibit a misalignment between their language-based reasoning and the low-level trajectories required for action-level planning. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to fine-tune VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that LaViPlan improves planning performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. While linguistic fidelity slightly decreases after RLVR-based fine-tuning, qualitative evaluation indicates that the outputs remain coherent. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of sampling ratio and reasoning guidance, highlighting how these design choices influence performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of RLVR as a post-training paradigm for aligning language-guided reasoning with action-level planning in autonomous driving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.

  Video Generation Models (VGMs) have become powerful backbones for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging large-scale pretraining for robust dynamics modeling. However, current methods underutilize their distribution modeling capabilities for predicting future states. Two challenges hinder progress: integrating generative processes into feature learning is both technically and conceptually underdeveloped, and naive frame-by-frame video diffusion is computationally inefficient for real-time robotics. To address these, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a dual-system world model for real-time, risk-aware planning. MinD uses two asynchronous diffusion processes: a low-frequency visual generator (LoDiff) that predicts future scenes and a high-frequency diffusion policy (HiDiff) that outputs actions. Our key insight is that robotic policies do not require fully denoised frames but can rely on low-resolution latents generated in a single denoising step. To connect early predictions to actions, we introduce DiffMatcher, a video-action alignment module with a novel co-training strategy that synchronizes the two diffusion models. MinD achieves a 63% success rate on RL-Bench, 60% on real-world Franka tasks, and operates at 11.3 FPS, demonstrating the efficiency of single-step latent features for control signals. Furthermore, MinD identifies 74% of potential task failures in advance, providing real-time safety signals for monitoring and intervention. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and reliable robotic manipulation using generative world models.

  Imitation learning is a promising approach for enabling generalist capabilities in humanoid robots, but its scaling is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality expert demonstrations. This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging suboptimal, open-ended play data, often easier to collect and offering greater diversity. This work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, specifically Flow Matching, an alternative to Diffusion models. We introduce a method for estimating the minimum or maximum of the learned distribution by leveraging the unique properties of Flow Matching, namely, deterministic transport and support for arbitrary source distributions. We apply this method to develop several goal-conditioned imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms based on Flow Matching, where policies are conditioned on both current and goal observations. We explore and compare different architectural configurations by combining core components, such as critic, planner, actor, or world model, in various ways. We evaluated our agents on the OGBench benchmark and analyzed how different demonstration behaviors during data collection affect performance in a 2D non-prehensile pushing task. Furthermore, we validated our approach on real hardware by deploying it on the Talos humanoid robot to perform complex manipulation tasks based on high-dimensional image observations, featuring a sequence of pick-and-place and articulated object manipulation in a realistic kitchen environment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose a factor graph optimization (FGO) framework to simultaneously solve the calibration problem for Ultra-WideBand (UWB) anchors and the robot localization problem. Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imagine a robot learning locomotion skills from any single video, without labels or reward engineering. We introduce SDS ("See it. Do it. Sorted."), an automated pipeline for skill acquisition from unstructured demonstrations. Using GPT-4o, SDS applies novel prompting techniques, in the form of spatio-temporal grid-based visual encoding ($G_{v}$) and structured input decomposition (SUS). These produce executable reward functions (RF) from the raw input videos. The RFs are used to train PPO policies and are optimized through closed-loop evolution, using training footage and performance metrics as self-supervised signals. SDS allows quadrupeds (e.g. Unitree Go1) to learn four gaits -- trot, bound, pace, and hop -- achieving 100% gait matching fidelity, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance in the order of $10^{-6}$, and stable locomotion with zero failures, both in simulation and the real world. SDS generalizes to morphologically different quadrupeds (e.g. ANYmal) and outperforms prior work in data efficiency, training time and engineering effort. Further materials and the code are open-source under:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present a real-time photo-realistic SLAM method based on marrying Gaussian Splatting with LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM. Most existing radiance-field-based SLAM systems mainly focus on bounded indoor environments, equipped with RGB-D or RGB sensors. However, they are prone to decline when expanding to unbounded scenes or encountering adverse conditions, such as violent motions and changing illumination. In contrast, oriented to general scenarios, our approach additionally tightly fuses LiDAR, IMU, and camera for robust pose estimation and photo-realistic online mapping. To compensate for regions unobserved by the LiDAR, we propose to integrate both the triangulated visual points from images and LiDAR points for initializing 3D Gaussians. In addition, the modeling of the sky and varying camera exposure have been realized for high-quality rendering. Notably, we implement our system purely with C++ and CUDA, and meticulously design a series of strategies to accelerate the online optimization of the Gaussian-based scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms its counterparts while maintaining real-time capability. Impressively, regarding photo-realistic mapping, our method with our estimated poses even surpasses all the compared approaches that utilize privileged ground-truth poses for mapping. Our code has been released onthis https URL.
