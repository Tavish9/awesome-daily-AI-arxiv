- **[Agent RL Scaling Law: Agent RL with Spontaneous Code Execution for Mathematical Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07773)**  `arXiv:2505.07773`  
  _Xinji Mai, Haotian Xu, Xing W, Weinong Wang, Yingying Zhang, Wenqiang Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

- **["I Apologize For Not Understanding Your Policy": Exploring the Specification and Evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies by AI Virtual Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07759)**  `arXiv:2505.07759`  
  _Jennifer Mondragon, Carlos Rubio-Medrano, Gael Cruz, Dvijesh Shastri_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Virtual Assistants (VAs) e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and High-Flyer Deepseek has turned them into convenient interfaces for managing emerging technologies such as Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Electronic Health Records, by means of explicit commands,e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, thus providing a very convenient interface for end-users. However, the proper specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs), the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data and device functionality - within these VAs presents significant challenges, since such a process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This study provides an initial exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes.

- **[Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive RSI (Part I): Theoretical Foundations and Single-Agent Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07757)**  `arXiv:2505.07757`  
  _Rintaro Ando_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive Recursive Self-Improvement (EG-MRSI) framework, a novel architecture that integrates introspective metacognition, emotion-based intrinsic motivation, and recursive self-modification into a unified theoretical system. The framework is explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation, EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration, emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part IV). Together, the EG-MRSI series provides a rigorous, extensible foundation for open-ended and safe AGI.

- **[Belief Injection for Epistemic Control in Linguistic State Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07693)**  `arXiv:2505.07693`  
  _Sebastian Dumbrava_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces belief injection, a proactive epistemic control mechanism for artificial agents whose cognitive states are structured as dynamic ensembles of linguistic belief fragments. Grounded in the Semantic Manifold framework, belief injection directly incorporates targeted linguistic beliefs into an agent's internal cognitive state, influencing reasoning and alignment proactively rather than reactively. We delineate various injection strategies, such as direct, context-aware, goal-oriented, and reflective approaches, and contrast belief injection with related epistemic control mechanisms, notably belief filtering. Additionally, this work discusses practical applications, implementation considerations, ethical implications, and outlines promising directions for future research into cognitive governance using architecturally embedded belief injection.

- **[S-GRPO: Early Exit via Reinforcement Learning in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07686)**  `arXiv:2505.07686`  
  _Muzhi Dai, Chenxu Yang, Qingyi Si_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of thinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate compatibility with state-of-the-art reasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill models, achieving 35.4% ~ 61.1\% sequence length reduction with 0.72% ~ 6.08% accuracy improvements across GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

- **[QuantX: A Framework for Hardware-Aware Quantization of Generative AI Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07531)**  `arXiv:2505.07531`  
  _Khurram Mazher, Saad Bin Nasir_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present QuantX: a tailored suite of recipes for LLM and VLM quantization. It is capable of quantizing down to 3-bit resolutions with minimal loss in performance. The quantization strategies in QuantX take into account hardware-specific constraints to achieve efficient dequantization during inference ensuring flexible trade-off between runtime speed, memory requirement and model accuracy. Our results demonstrate that QuantX achieves performance within 6% of the unquantized model for LlaVa-v1.6 quantized down to 3-bits for multiple end user tasks and outperforms recently published state-of-the-art quantization techniques. This manuscript provides insights into the LLM quantization process that motivated the range of recipes and options that are incorporated in QuantX.

- **[HALO: Half Life-Based Outdated Fact Filtering in Temporal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07509)**  `arXiv:2505.07509`  
  _Feng Ding, Tingting Wang, Yupeng Gao, Shuo Yu, Jing Ren, Feng Xia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Outdated facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) result from exceeding the expiration date of facts, which negatively impact reasoning performance on TKGs. However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts. Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering outdated facts (Codes are available atthis https URL).

- **[Web-Bench: A LLM Code Benchmark Based on Web Standards and Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07473)**  `arXiv:2505.07473`  
  _Kai Xu, YiWei Mao, XinYi Guan, ZiLong Feng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of coding is evolving rapidly: from code assistants, to autonomous coding agents, and then to generating complete projects through natural language. Early LLM code benchmarks primarily focused on code generation accuracy, but these benchmarks have gradually become saturated. Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%. Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence, simulating real-world human development workflows. When designing Web-Bench, we aim to cover the foundational elements of Web development: Web Standards and Web Frameworks. Given the scale and complexity of these projects, which were designed by engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience, each presents a significant challenge. On average, a single project takes 4 to 8 hours for a senior engineer to complete. On our given benchmark agent (Web-Agent), SOTA (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) achieves only 25.1% Pass@1, significantly lower (better) than SWE-Bench's Verified (65.4%) and Full (33.8%) scores. Finally, we discuss that in any development field, Standards and Frameworks represent foundational knowledge and efficiency tools, respectively, and LLMs require optimization tailored to them.

- **[A Survey on Collaborative Mechanisms Between Large and Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07460)**  `arXiv:2505.07460`  
  _Yi Chen, JiaHao Zhao, HaoHao Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion), key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial intelligence.

- **[How well do LLMs reason over tabular data, really?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07453)**  `arXiv:2505.07453`  
  _Cornelius Wolff, Madelon Hulsebos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

- **[AIS Data-Driven Maritime Monitoring Based on Transformer: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07374)**  `arXiv:2505.07374`  
  _Zhiye Xie, Enmei Tu, Xianping Fu, Guoliang Yuan, Yi Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the increasing demands for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in global shipping, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays an increasingly important role in maritime monitoring. AIS data contains spatial-temporal variation patterns of vessels that hold significant research value in the marine domain. However, due to its massive scale, the full potential of AIS data has long remained untapped. With its powerful sequence modeling capabilities, particularly its ability to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal dynamics, the Transformer model has emerged as an effective tool for processing AIS data. Therefore, this paper reviews the research on Transformer-based AIS data-driven maritime monitoring, providing a comprehensive overview of the current applications of Transformer models in the marine field. The focus is on Transformer-based trajectory prediction methods, behavior detection, and prediction techniques. Additionally, this paper collects and organizes publicly available AIS datasets from the reviewed papers, performing data filtering, cleaning, and statistical analysis. The statistical results reveal the operational characteristics of different vessel types, providing data support for further research on maritime monitoring tasks. Finally, we offer valuable suggestions for future research, identifying two promising research directions. Datasets are available atthis https URL.

- **[FedIFL: A federated cross-domain diagnostic framework for motor-driven systems with inconsistent fault modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07315)**  `arXiv:2505.07315`  
  _Zexiao Wang, Yankai Wang, Xiaoqiang Liao, Xinguo Ming, Weiming Shen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the scarcity of industrial data, individual equipment users, particularly start-ups, struggle to independently train a comprehensive fault diagnosis model; federated learning enables collaborative training while ensuring data privacy, making it an ideal solution. However, the diversity of working conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in inconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic scenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on client-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to map different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens the aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this article proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype contrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently, feature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other clients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a feature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain shifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is designed to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between different clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and an orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from the invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising generalization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for target clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces. Experiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of FedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.

- **[Measuring General Intelligence with Generated Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07215)**  `arXiv:2505.07215`  
  _Vivek Verma, David Huang, William Chen, Dan Klein, Nicholas Tomlin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

- **[Accountability of Generative AI: Exploring a Precautionary Approach for "Artificially Created Nature"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07178)**  `arXiv:2505.07178`  
  _Yuri Nakao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies raises concerns about the accountability of sociotechnical systems. Current generative AI systems rely on complex mechanisms that make it difficult for even experts to fully trace the reasons behind the outputs. This paper first examines existing research on AI transparency and accountability and argues that transparency is not a sufficient condition for accountability but can contribute to its improvement. We then discuss that if it is not possible to make generative AI transparent, generative AI technology becomes ``artificially created nature'' in a metaphorical sense, and suggest using the precautionary principle approach to consider AI risks. Finally, we propose that a platform for citizen participation is needed to address the risks of generative AI.

- **[RefPentester: A Knowledge-Informed Self-Reflective Penetration Testing Framework Based on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07089)**  `arXiv:2505.07089`  
  _Hanzheng Dai, Yuanliang Li, Zhibo Zhang, Jun Yan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models (LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. In addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\%. Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT stage transitions.

- **[Architectural Precedents for General Agents using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07087)**  `arXiv:2505.07087`  
  _Robert E. Wray, James R. Kirk, John E. Laird_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even different research traditions have somewhat independently identified similar/common patterns of processes and representations or cognitive design patterns that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of mechanism and representation available for exploring the possibilities of general intelligence. In this paper, we summarize a few recurring cognitive design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures. We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs, especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. By examining and applying these recurring patterns, we can also predict gaps or deficiencies in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identify likely subjects of future research towards general intelligence using LLMs and other generative foundation models.

- **[Arbitrarily Applicable Same/Opposite Relational Responding with NARS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07079)**  `arXiv:2505.07079`  
  _Robert Johansson, Patrick Hammer, Tony Lofthouse_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Same/opposite relational responding, a fundamental aspect of human symbolic cognition, allows the flexible generalization of stimulus relationships based on minimal experience. In this study, we demonstrate the emergence of \textit{arbitrarily applicable} same/opposite relational responding within the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), a computational cognitive architecture designed for adaptive reasoning under uncertainty. Specifically, we extend NARS with an implementation of \textit{acquired relations}, enabling the system to explicitly derive both symmetric (mutual entailment) and novel relational combinations (combinatorial entailment) from minimal explicit training in a contextually controlled matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. Experimental results show that NARS rapidly internalizes explicitly trained relational rules and robustly demonstrates derived relational generalizations based on arbitrary contextual cues. Importantly, derived relational responding in critical test phases inherently combines both mutual and combinatorial entailments, such as deriving same-relations from multiple explicitly trained opposite-relations. Internal confidence metrics illustrate strong internalization of these relational principles, closely paralleling phenomena observed in human relational learning experiments. Our findings underscore the potential for integrating nuanced relational learning mechanisms inspired by learning psychology into artificial general intelligence frameworks, explicitly highlighting the arbitrary and context-sensitive relational capabilities modeled within NARS.

- **[Unlocking Non-Block-Structured Decisions: Inductive Mining with Choice Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07052)**  `arXiv:2505.07052`  
  _Humam Kourani, Gyunam Park, Wil M.P. van der Aalst_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from event logs, enabling organizations to analyze and improve their operational processes. Inductive mining algorithms, while prioritizing soundness and efficiency through hierarchical modeling languages, often impose a strict block-structured representation. This limits their ability to accurately capture the complexities of real-world processes. While recent advancements like the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) have addressed the block-structure limitation for concurrency, a significant gap remains in effectively modeling non-block-structured decision points. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing an extension of POWL to handle non-block-structured decisions through the introduction of choice graphs. Choice graphs offer a structured yet flexible approach to model complex decision logic within the hierarchical framework of POWL. We present an inductive mining discovery algorithm that uses our extension and preserves the quality guarantees of the inductive mining framework. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the discovered models, enriched with choice graphs, more precisely represent the complex decision-making behavior found in real-world processes, without compromising the high scalability inherent in inductive mining techniques.

- **[DialogueReason: Rule-Based RL Sparks Dialogue Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07049)**  `arXiv:2505.07049`  
  _Yubo Shu, Zhewei Huang, Xin Wu, Chen Hu, Shuchang Zhou, Daxin Jiang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose DialogueReason, a reasoning paradigm that uncovers the lost roles in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to boost diversity and coherency of the reasoning process. Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason, structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, Artificial Intelligence technology has excelled in various applications across all domains and fields. However, the various algorithms in neural networks make it difficult to understand the reasons behind decisions. For this reason, trustworthy AI techniques have started gaining popularity. The concept of trustworthiness is cross-disciplinary; it must meet societal standards and principles, and technology is used to fulfill these requirements. In this paper, we first surveyed developments from various countries and regions on the ethical elements that make AI algorithms trustworthy; and then focused our survey on the state of the art research into the interpretability of AI. We have conducted an intensive survey on technologies and techniques used in making AI explainable. Finally, we identified new trends in achieving explainable AI. In particular, we elaborate on the strong link between the explainability of AI and the meta-reasoning of autonomous systems. The concept of meta-reasoning is 'reason the reasoning', which coincides with the intention and goal of explainable Al. The integration of the approaches could pave the way for future interpretable AI systems.

- **[A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Cooperative Air-Ground-Human Crowdsensing in Emergency Rescue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06997)**  `arXiv:2505.06997`  
  _Wenhao Lu, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Yonglin Tian, Junjie Zeng, Jun Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel ``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs, alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs, including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42% increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its strong potential for practical application in emergency response.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task model merging offers a promising paradigm for integrating multiple expert models into a unified model without additional training. Existing state-of-the-art techniques, such as Task Arithmetic and its variants, merge models by accumulating task vectors -- the parameter differences between pretrained and finetuned models. However, task vector accumulation is often hindered by knowledge conflicts, leading to performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging), a novel training-free framework that selectively trims conflict-prone components from the task vectors. CAT Merging introduces several parameter-specific strategies, including projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments on vision, language, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that CAT Merging effectively suppresses knowledge conflicts, achieving average accuracy improvements of up to 2.5% (ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) over state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in diverse general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their utility in the scientific domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) is unclear. Hence, it necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids (ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050. Dataset link:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI), which involves intelligent systems with physical presence and real-time interaction with the environment, has emerged as a key research direction in pursuit of AGI. While advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, large-scale language models, and multimodal technologies have significantly contributed to the progress of EAI, most existing reviews focus on specific technologies or applications. A systematic overview, particularly one that explores the direct connection between EAI and AGI, remains scarce. This paper examines EAI as a foundational approach to AGI, systematically analyzing its four core modules: perception, intelligent decision-making, action, and feedback. We provide a detailed discussion of how each module contributes to the six core principles of AGI. Additionally, we discuss future trends, challenges, and research directions in EAI, emphasizing its potential as a cornerstone for AGI development. Our findings suggest that EAI's integration of dynamic learning and real-world interaction is essential for bridging the gap between narrow AI and AGI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness, generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agentic AI systems represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence, where agents often based on large language models(LLMs) interact with tools, environments, and other agents to accomplish tasks with a degree of autonomy. These systems show promise across a range of domains, but their architectural underpinnings remain immature. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of the types of agents, their modes of interaction with the environment, and the infrastructural and architectural challenges that emerge. We identify a gap in how these systems manage tool orchestration at scale and propose a reusable design abstraction: the "Control Plane as a Tool" pattern. This pattern allows developers to expose a single tool interface to an agent while encapsulating modular tool routing logic behind it. We position this pattern within the broader context of agent design and argue that it addresses several key challenges in scaling, safety, and extensibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF) simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions. However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field (BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction. Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents, facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

  Wild salmon are essential to the ecological, economic, and cultural sustainability of the North Pacific Rim. Yet climate variability, habitat loss, and data limitations in remote ecosystems that lack basic infrastructure support pose significant challenges to effective fisheries management. This project explores the integration of multimodal foundation AI and expert-in-the-loop frameworks to enhance wild salmon monitoring and sustainable fisheries management in Indigenous rivers across Pacific Northwest. By leveraging video and sonar-based monitoring, we develop AI-powered tools for automated species identification, counting, and length measurement, reducing manual effort, expediting delivery of results, and improving decision-making accuracy. Expert validation and active learning frameworks ensure ecological relevance while reducing annotation burdens. To address unique technical and societal challenges, we bring together a cross-domain, interdisciplinary team of university researchers, fisheries biologists, Indigenous stewardship practitioners, government agencies, and conservation organizations. Through these collaborations, our research fosters ethical AI co-development, open data sharing, and culturally informed fisheries management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle. These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from 58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page:this https URL.

  _Hua Meng, Zhiguo Long, Michael Sioutis, Zhengchun Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules to constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed to characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading to multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief condition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is important to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief information through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new evidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and expressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision rules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra, including an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision. We prove that the revision result is uniquely determined given the current belief state and new evidence. Furthermore, to make the framework more useful in practice, we develop a particular algorithm for performing the proposed revision process. We argue that this approach may offer a more predictable and principled method for belief revision, making it suitable for real-world applications.

  In the dynamic landscape of Industry 4.0, achieving efficiency, precision, and adaptability is essential to optimize manufacturing operations. Industries suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production and decision-making. We propose SmartPilot, a neurosymbolic, multiagent CoPilot designed for advanced reasoning and contextual decision-making to address these challenges. SmartPilot processes multimodal sensor data and is compact to deploy on edge devices. It focuses on three key tasks: anomaly prediction, production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. By bridging the gap between AI capabilities and real-world industrial needs, SmartPilot empowers industries with intelligent decision-making and drives transformative innovation in manufacturing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The concept of openness in AI has so far been heavily inspired by the definition and community practice of open source software. This positions openness in AI as having positive connotations; it introduces assumptions of certain advantages, such as collaborative innovation and transparency. However, the practices and benefits of open source software are not fully transferable to AI, which has its own challenges. Framing a notion of openness tailored to AI is crucial to addressing its growing societal implications, risks, and capabilities. We argue that considering the fundamental scope of openness in different disciplines will broaden discussions, introduce important perspectives, and reflect on what openness in AI should mean. Toward this goal, we qualitatively analyze 98 concepts of openness discovered from topic modeling, through which we develop a taxonomy of openness. Using this taxonomy as an instrument, we situate the current discussion on AI openness, identify gaps and highlight links with other disciplines. Our work contributes to the recent efforts in framing openness in AI by reflecting principles and practices of openness beyond open source software and calls for a more holistic view of openness in terms of actions, system properties, and ethical objectives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.

Second, the extracted information is represented in a memory consisting of a knowledge graph enhanced by vector embeddings to efficiently manage relational information.

  The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society. Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic, dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

  Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.

  This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

  How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit. Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model.

  As digitalization and cloud technologies evolve, the web is becoming increasingly important in the modern society. Autonomous web agents based on large language models (LLMs) hold a great potential in work automation. It is therefore important to accurately measure and monitor the progression of their capabilities. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the current state of web agents. Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.

  With the advancement of web techniques, they have significantly revolutionized various aspects of people's lives. Despite the importance of the web, many tasks performed on it are repetitive and time-consuming, negatively impacting overall quality of life. To efficiently handle these tedious daily tasks, one of the most promising approaches is to advance autonomous agents based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, referred to as AI Agents, as they can operate continuously without fatigue or performance degradation. In the context of the web, leveraging AI Agents -- termed WebAgents -- to automatically assist people in handling tedious daily tasks can dramatically enhance productivity and efficiency. Recently, Large Foundation Models (LFMs) containing billions of parameters have exhibited human-like language understanding and reasoning capabilities, showing proficiency in performing various complex tasks. This naturally raises the question: `Can LFMs be utilized to develop powerful AI Agents that automatically handle web tasks, providing significant convenience to users?' To fully explore the potential of LFMs, extensive research has emerged on WebAgents designed to complete daily web tasks according to user instructions, significantly enhancing the convenience of daily human life. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies on WebAgents across three key aspects: architectures, training, and trustworthiness. Additionally, several promising directions for future research are explored to provide deeper insights.

  World models aim to learn action-controlled future prediction and have proven essential for the development of intelligent agents. However, most existing world models rely heavily on substantial action-labeled data and costly training, making it challenging to adapt to novel environments with heterogeneous actions through limited interactions. This limitation can hinder their applicability across broader domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose AdaWorld, an innovative world model learning approach that enables efficient adaptation. The key idea is to incorporate action information during the pretraining of world models. This is achieved by extracting latent actions from videos in a self-supervised manner, capturing the most critical transitions between frames. We then develop an autoregressive world model that conditions on these latent actions. This learning paradigm enables highly adaptable world models, facilitating efficient transfer and learning of new actions even with limited interactions and finetuning. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple environments demonstrate that AdaWorld achieves superior performance in both simulation quality and visual planning.

  AI presents a novel tool for deciphering the motivations behind human behaviors. By varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit the full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in classic economic games. By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we infer (decipher) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how one can analyze the prompts to reveal relationships between the classic economic games, providing insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to understand differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations. We show how AI offers a new way to examine the thinking and framing that produce different behaviors.

  This paper introduces ExKLoP, a novel framework designed to evaluate how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate expert knowledge into logical reasoning systems. This capability is especially valuable in engineering, where expert knowledge-such as manufacturer-recommended operational ranges-can be directly embedded into automated monitoring systems. By mirroring expert verification steps, tasks like range checking and constraint validation help ensure system safety and reliability. Our approach systematically evaluates LLM-generated logical rules, assessing both syntactic fluency and logical correctness in these critical validation tasks. We also explore the models' capacity for self-correction via an iterative feedback loop based on code execution outcomes. ExKLoP presents an extensible dataset comprising 130 engineering premises, 950 prompts, and corresponding validation points. It enables comprehensive benchmarking while allowing control over task complexity and scalability of experiments. We leverage the synthetic data creation methodology to conduct extensive empirical evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs including Llama3, Gemma3, Codestral and QwenCoder. The results reveal that most models generate nearly perfect syntactically correct code and exhibit strong performance in translating expert knowledge into correct code. At the same time, while most LLMs produce nearly flawless syntactic output, their ability to correctly implement logical rules varies, as does their capacity for self-improvement. Overall, ExKLoP serves as a robust evaluation platform that streamlines the selection of effective models for self-correcting systems while clearly delineating the types of errors encountered.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Local causal discovery aims to learn and distinguish the direct causes and effects of a target variable from observed data. Existing constraint-based local causal discovery methods use AND or OR rules in constructing the local causal skeleton, but using either rule alone is prone to produce cascading errors in the learned local causal skeleton, and thus impacting the inference of local causal relationships. On the other hand, directly applying score-based global causal discovery methods to local causal discovery may randomly return incorrect results due to the existence of local equivalence classes. To address the above issues, we propose a Hybrid Local Causal Discovery algorithm, called HLCD. Specifically, HLCD initially utilizes a constraint-based approach combined with the OR rule to obtain a candidate skeleton and then employs a score-based method to eliminate redundant portions in the candidate skeleton. Furthermore, during the local causal orientation phase, HLCD distinguishes between V-structures and equivalence classes by comparing the local structure scores between the two, thereby avoiding orientation interference caused by local equivalence classes. We conducted extensive experiments with seven state-of-the-art competitors on 14 benchmark Bayesian network datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that HLCD significantly outperforms existing local causal discovery algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fair allocation of indivisible resources is a fundamental problem. Existing research has developed various allocation mechanisms or algorithms to satisfy different fairness notions. For example, round robin (RR) was proposed to meet the fairness criterion known as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). Expert algorithms without mathematical formulations are used in real-world resource allocation problems to find preferable outcomes for users. Therefore, we aim to design mechanisms that strictly satisfy good properties with replicating expert knowledge. However, this problem is challenging because such heuristic rules are often difficult to formalize mathematically, complicating their integration into theoretical frameworks. Additionally, formal algorithms struggle to find preferable outcomes, and directly replicating these implicit rules can result in unfair allocations because human decision-making can introduce biases. In this paper, we aim to learn implicit allocation mechanisms from examples while strictly satisfying fairness constraints, specifically focusing on learning EF1 allocation mechanisms through supervised learning on examples of reported valuations and corresponding allocation outcomes produced by implicit rules. To address this, we developed a neural RR (NRR), a novel neural network that parameterizes RR. NRR is built from a differentiable relaxation of RR and can be trained to learn the agent ordering used for RR. We conducted experiments to learn EF1 allocation mechanisms from examples, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of the proximity of predicted allocations and other metrics.

  Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.

  We introduce CHARTOM, a visual theory-of-mind benchmark for multimodal large language models. CHARTOM consists of specially designed data visualizing charts. Given a chart, a language model needs to not only correctly comprehend the chart (the FACT question) but also judge if the chart will be misleading to a human reader (the MIND question). Both questions have significant societal benefits. We detail the construction of the CHARTOM benchmark including its calibration on human performance. We benchmark leading LLMs as of late 2024 - including GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Llama, and Llava - on the CHARTOM dataset and found that our benchmark was challenging to all of them, suggesting room for future large language models to improve.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a transformative framework for artificial neural networks over graded vector spaces, tailored to model hierarchical and structured data in fields like algebraic geometry and physics. By exploiting the algebraic properties of graded vector spaces, where features carry distinct weights, we extend classical neural networks with graded neurons, layers, and activation functions that preserve structural integrity. Grounded in group actions, representation theory, and graded algebra, our approach combines theoretical rigor with practical utility.We introduce graded neural architectures, loss functions prioritizing graded components, and equivariant extensions adaptable to diverse gradings. Case studies validate the framework's effectiveness, outperforming standard neural networks in tasks such as predicting invariants in weighted projective spaces and modeling supersymmetric systems.This work establishes a new frontier in machine learning, merging mathematical sophistication with interdisciplinary applications. Future challenges, including computational scalability and finite field extensions, offer rich opportunities for advancing this paradigm.

  In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.

  _M√°t√© Gedeon_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various static word embeddings for Hungarian, including traditional models such as Word2Vec, FastText, as well as static embeddings derived from BERT-based models using different extraction methods. We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For intrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the embeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results indicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in this task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among the BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings demonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate methods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For extrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results reveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted using the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo embeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks, underscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a static form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word embeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods to enhance the utility of BERT-based models. This piece of research contributes to the understanding of embedding performance in the Hungarian language and provides valuable insights for future developments in the field. The training scripts, evaluation codes, restricted vocabulary, and extracted embeddings will be made publicly available to support further research and reproducibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have the ability to self-correct even when they make mistakes in their reasoning paths. However, our study reveals that when the reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes difficult for the model to recover. We refer to this phenomenon as the "Prefix Dominance Trap". Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can promote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate individuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this phenomenon. Specifically, every tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its intermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism, enabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference. However, we observe that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and reflection instructions effectively. To address this, we fine-tune them into our **LeaP-T** model series. Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025, and GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements. For instance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the baseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks with an average gain of 3.3 points. Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024. In-depth analysis reveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong error tolerance and handling varied task difficulty. LeaP marks a milestone by enabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning. Our code, datasets, and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent improvement in large language model performance have, in all likelihood, been accompanied by improvement in how well they can approximate the distribution of their training data. In this work, we explore the following question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in LLM training data -- Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity. We find that the majority of the regenerated distributions show a shifted mean, a lower standard deviation, and a reduction of the long tail, as compared to the human originals.

  _Letian Peng, Jingbo Shang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for behavioral decision-making. Each profile defines a set of functions parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g., if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true, false, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that prompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses against ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and behavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for local deployment of role-play agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody -- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather than categorical.

  Understanding labor market dynamics is essential for policymakers, employers, and job seekers. However, comprehensive datasets that capture real-world career trajectories are scarce. In this paper, we introduce JobHop, a large-scale public dataset derived from anonymized resumes provided by VDAB, the public employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3 million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000 user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics, including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating its value for advancing labor market research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human cognition is deeply intertwined with a sense of time, known as Chronoception. This sense allows us to judge how long facts remain valid and when knowledge becomes outdated. Despite progress in vision, language, and motor control, AI still struggles to reason about temporal validity. We introduce Chronocept, the first benchmark to model temporal validity as a continuous probability distribution over time. Using skew-normal curves fitted along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets: Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages). Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based approaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning, supporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment, demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in guiding LLM behavior.

  We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed.

  Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin - capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive storytelling and automated narrative generation.

  _Ziyang Huang, Xiaowei Yuan, Yiming Ju, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels. Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code and data are available inthis https URL.

  _Lei Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models frequently encounter hallucination phenomena when integrating external information with internal parametric knowledge. Empirical studies demonstrate that the disequilibrium between external contextual information and internal parametric knowledge constitutes a primary factor in hallucination generation. Existing hallucination detection methodologies predominantly emphasize either the external or internal mechanism in isolation, thereby overlooking their synergistic effects. The recently proposed ReDeEP framework decouples these dual mechanisms, identifying two critical contributors to hallucinations: excessive reliance on parametric knowledge encoded in feed-forward networks (FFN) and insufficient utilization of external information by attention mechanisms (particularly copy heads). ReDeEP quantitatively assesses these factors to detect hallucinations and dynamically modulates the contributions of FFNs and copy heads to attenuate their occurrence. Nevertheless, ReDeEP and numerous other hallucination detection approaches have been employed at logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency evaluation, inadequately address the semantic dimensions of model responses, resulting in inconsistent hallucination assessments in RAG implementations. Building upon ReDeEP's foundation, this paper introduces SEReDeEP, which enhances computational processes through semantic entropy captured via trained linear probes, thereby achieving hallucination assessments that more accurately reflect ground truth evaluations.

  The tool-using capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to access up-to-date external information and handle complex tasks. Current approaches to enhancing this capability primarily rely on distilling advanced models by data synthesis. However, this method incurs significant costs associated with advanced model usage and often results in data compatibility issues, led by the high discrepancy in the knowledge scope between the advanced model and the target model. To address these challenges, we propose ToolACE-DEV, a self-improving framework for tool learning. First, we decompose the tool-learning objective into sub-tasks that enhance basic tool-making and tool-using abilities. Then, we introduce a self-evolving paradigm that allows lightweight models to self-improve, reducing reliance on advanced LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across models of varying scales and architectures.

  This paper introduces and evaluates three translations of the Grievance Dictionary, a psycholinguistic dictionary for the analysis of violent, threatening or grievance-fuelled texts. Considering the relevance of these themes in languages beyond English, we translated the Grievance Dictionary to Dutch, German, and Italian. We describe the process of automated translation supplemented by human annotation. Psychometric analyses are performed, including internal reliability of dictionary categories and correlations with the LIWC dictionary. The Dutch and German translations perform similarly to the original English version, whereas the Italian dictionary shows low reliability for some categories. Finally, we make suggestions for further validation and application of the dictionary, as well as for future dictionary translations following a similar approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Commonsense knowledge bases (KB) are a source of specialized knowledge that is widely used to improve machine learning applications. However, even for a large KB such as ConceptNet, capturing explicit knowledge from each industry domain is challenging. For example, only a few samples of general {\em tasks} performed by various industries are available in ConceptNet. Here, a task is a well-defined knowledge-based volitional action to achieve a particular goal. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and present a weakly-supervised framework to augment commonsense KB with tasks carried out by various industry groups (IG). We attempt to {\em match} each task with one or more suitable IGs by training a neural model to learn task-IG affinity and apply clustering to select the top-k tasks per IG. We extract a total of 2339 triples of the form $\langle IG, is~capable~of, task \rangle$ from two publicly available news datasets for 24 IGs with the precision of 0.86. This validates the reliability of the extracted task-IG pairs that can be directly added to existing KBs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of global health crises, such as COVID-19 and Monkeypox (mpox), has underscored the importance of understanding public sentiment to inform effective public health strategies. This study conducts a comparative sentiment analysis of public perceptions surrounding COVID-19 and mpox by leveraging extensive datasets of 147,475 and 106,638 tweets, respectively. Advanced machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa and XLNet, were applied to perform sentiment classification, with results indicating key trends in public emotion and discourse. The analysis highlights significant differences in public sentiment driven by disease characteristics, media representation, and pandemic fatigue. Through the lens of sentiment polarity and thematic trends, this study offers valuable insights into tailoring public health messaging, mitigating misinformation, and fostering trust during concurrent health crises. The findings contribute to advancing sentiment analysis applications in public health informatics, setting the groundwork for enhanced real-time monitoring and multilingual analysis in future research.

  Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available atthis https URL

  Democratic societies need reliable information. Misinformation in popular media such as news articles or videos threatens to impair civic discourse. Citizens are, unfortunately, not equipped to verify this content flood consumed daily at increasing rates. This work aims to semi-automatically quantify scientific accuracy of online media. By semantifying media of unknown veracity, their statements can be compared against equally processed trusted sources. We implemented a workflow using LLM-based statement extraction and knowledge graph analysis. Our neurosymbolic system was able to evidently streamline state-of-the-art veracity quantification. Evaluated via expert interviews and a user survey, the tool provides a beneficial veracity indication. This indicator, however, is unable to annotate public media at the required granularity and scale. Further work towards a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) ground truth and complementary metrics are required to scientifically support civic discourse.

  Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2) Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration), and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, there has been growing interest in collecting reasoning-intensive pretraining data to improve LLMs' complex reasoning ability. Prior approaches typically rely on supervised classifiers to identify such data, which requires labeling by humans or LLMs, often introducing domain-specific biases. Due to the attention heads being crucial to in-context reasoning, we propose AttentionInfluence, a simple yet effective, training-free method without supervision signal. Our approach enables a small pretrained language model to act as a strong data selector through a simple attention head masking operation. Specifically, we identify retrieval heads and compute the loss difference when masking these heads. We apply AttentionInfluence to a 1.3B-parameter dense model to conduct data selection on the SmolLM corpus of 241B tokens, and mix the SmolLM corpus with the selected subset comprising 73B tokens to pretrain a 7B-parameter dense model using 1T training tokens and WSD learning rate scheduling. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements, ranging from 1.4pp to 3.5pp, across several knowledge-intensive and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (i.e., MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGIEval-en, GSM8K, and HumanEval). This demonstrates an effective weak-to-strong scaling property, with small models improving the final performance of larger models-offering a promising and scalable path for reasoning-centric data selection.

  The exponential growth in Large Language Model (LLM) deployment has intensified the need for efficient model compression techniques to reduce computational and memory costs. While pruning and quantization have shown promise, their combined potential remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine joint compression and how strategically combining pruning and quantization could yield superior performance-to-compression ratios compared to single-method approaches. Recognizing the challenges in accurately assessing LLM performance, we address key limitations of previous evaluation frameworks and introduce the Semantic Retention Compression Rate (SrCr), a novel metric that quantifies the trade-off between model compression and semantic preservation, facilitating the optimization of pruning-quantization configurations. Experiments demonstrate that our recommended combination achieves, on average, a 20% performance increase compared to an equivalent quantization-only model at the same theoretical compression rate.

  The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness, reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization, losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch, constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization, where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training.

  Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision boundary.Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5 datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious security risks.

  Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education, standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The model, data and code are available atthis https URL

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to transform healthcare under China's Healthy China 2030 initiative, yet they introduce new ethical and patient-safety challenges. We present a novel 12,000-item Q&A benchmark covering 11 ethics and 9 safety dimensions in medical contexts, to quantitatively evaluate these risks. Using this dataset, we assess state-of-the-art Chinese medical LLMs (e.g., Qwen 2.5-32B, DeepSeek), revealing moderate baseline performance (accuracy 42.7% for Qwen 2.5-32B) and significant improvements after fine-tuning on our data (up to 50.8% accuracy). Results show notable gaps in LLM decision-making on ethics and safety scenarios, reflecting insufficient institutional oversight. We then identify systemic governance shortfalls-including the lack of fine-grained ethical audit protocols, slow adaptation by hospital IRBs, and insufficient evaluation tools-that currently hinder safe LLM deployment. Finally, we propose a practical governance framework for healthcare institutions (embedding LLM auditing teams, enacting data ethics guidelines, and implementing safety simulation pipelines) to proactively manage LLM risks. Our study highlights the urgent need for robust LLM governance in Chinese healthcare, aligning AI innovation with patient safety and ethical standards.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance by leveraging vast pretraining corpora, yet their performance remains suboptimal in knowledge-intensive domains such as medicine and scientific research, where high factual precision is required. While synthetic data provides a promising avenue for augmenting domain knowledge, existing methods frequently generate redundant samples that do not align with the model's true knowledge gaps. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structural Entropy-guided Knowledge Navigator (SENATOR) framework that addresses the intrinsic knowledge deficiencies of LLMs. Our approach employs the Structure Entropy (SE) metric to quantify uncertainty along knowledge graph paths and leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to selectively explore regions where the model lacks domain-specific knowledge. Guided by these insights, the framework generates targeted synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, enabling continuous self-improvement. Experimental results on LLaMA-3 and Qwen2 across multiple domain-specific benchmarks show that SENATOR effectively detects and repairs knowledge deficiencies, achieving notable performance improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing volume of healthcare textual data requires computationally efficient, yet highly accurate classification approaches able to handle the nuanced and complex nature of medical terminology. This research presents Knowledge Distillation for Healthcare Multi-Label Text Classification (KDH-MLTC), a framework leveraging model compression and Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach addresses conventional healthcare Multi-Label Text Classification (MLTC) challenges by integrating knowledge distillation and sequential fine-tuning, subsequently optimized through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning. KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from a more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e., DistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the teacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational requirements. As a result, the classification is enabled to be conducted locally, making it suitable for healthcare textual data characterized by sensitivity and, therefore, ensuring HIPAA compliance. The experiments conducted on three medical literature datasets of different sizes, sampled from the Hallmark of Cancer (HoC) dataset, demonstrate that KDH-MLTC achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, particularly for the largest dataset, reaching an F1 score of 82.70%. Additionally, statistical validation and an ablation study are carried out, proving the robustness of KDH-MLTC. Furthermore, the PSO-based hyperparameter optimization process allowed the identification of optimal configurations. The proposed approach contributes to healthcare text classification research, balancing efficiency requirements in resource-constrained healthcare settings with satisfactory accuracy demands.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to adequately handle polysemy and rare words. This limitation typically results in topics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare topic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM. Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for embedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and similar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities. Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are extracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.

  Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

  A cuneiform tablet KBo 23.1 ++/KUB 30.38, which is known to represent a text of Kizzuwatna rituals, was written by two writers with almost identical content in two iterations. Unlike other cuneiform tablets that contained information such as myths, essays, or business records, the reason why ancient people left such tablets for posterity remains unclear. To study this problem, we develop a new methodology by analyzing images of a tablet quantitatively using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-based image models, without segmenting cuneiforms one-by-one. Our data-driven methodology implies that the writer writing the first half was a `teacher' and the other writer was a `student' who was training his skills of writing cuneiforms. This result has not been reached by classical linguistics. We also discuss related conclusions and possible further directions for applying our method and its generalizations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on diverse NLP tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning the model with a large number of parameters on limited downstream datasets often leads to vulnerability to adversarial attacks, causing overfitting of the model on standard datasets.To address these issues, we propose IM-BERT from the perspective of a dynamic system by conceptualizing a layer of BERT as a solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Under the situation of initial value perturbation, we analyze the numerical stability of two main numerical ODE solvers: the explicit and implicit Euler approaches.Based on these analyses, we introduce a numerically robust IM-connection incorporating BERT's layers. This strategy enhances the robustness of PLMs against adversarial attacks, even in low-resource scenarios, without introducing additional parameters or adversarial training strategies.Experimental results on the adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE) dataset validate the robustness of IM-BERT under various conditions. Compared to the original BERT, IM-BERT exhibits a performance improvement of approximately 8.3\%p on the AdvGLUE dataset. Furthermore, in low-resource scenarios, IM-BERT outperforms BERT by achieving 5.9\%p higher accuracy.

  Gating mechanisms have been widely utilized, from early models like LSTMs and Highway Networks to recent state space models, linear attention, and also softmax attention. Yet, existing literature rarely examines the specific effects of gating. In this work, we conduct comprehensive experiments to systematically investigate gating-augmented softmax attention variants. Specifically, we perform a comprehensive comparison over 30 variants of 15B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and 1.7B dense models trained on a 3.5 trillion token dataset. Our central finding is that a simple modification-applying a head-specific sigmoid gate after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA)-consistently improves performance. This modification also enhances training stability, tolerates larger learning rates, and improves scaling properties. By comparing various gating positions and computational variants, we attribute this effectiveness to two key factors: (1) introducing non-linearity upon the low-rank mapping in the softmax attention, and (2) applying query-dependent sparse gating scores to modulate the SDPA output. Notably, we find this sparse gating mechanism mitigates 'attention sink' and enhances long-context extrapolation performance, and we also release related $\href{this https URL}{codes}$ and $\href{this https URL}{models}$ to facilitate future research.

  Automatic evaluation benchmarks such as MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, and Auto-Arena are seeing growing adoption for the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing research has primarily focused on approximating human-based model rankings using limited data and LLM-as-a-Judge. However, the fundamental premise of these studies, which attempts to replicate human rankings, is flawed. Specifically, these benchmarks typically offer only overall scores, limiting their utility to leaderboard rankings, rather than providing feedback that can guide model optimization and support model profiling. Therefore, we advocate for an evaluation paradigm shift from approximating human-based model rankings to providing feedback with analytical value. To this end, we introduce Feedbacker, an evaluation framework that provides comprehensive and fine-grained results, thereby enabling thorough identification of a model's specific strengths and weaknesses. Such feedback not only supports the targeted optimization of the model but also enhances the understanding of its behavior. Feedbacker comprises three key components: an extensible tree-based query taxonomy builder, an automated query synthesis scheme, and a suite of visualization and analysis tools. Furthermore, we propose a novel LLM-as-a-Judge method: PC2 (Pre-Comparison-derived Criteria) pointwise evaluation. This method derives evaluation criteria by pre-comparing the differences between several auxiliary responses, achieving the accuracy of pairwise evaluation while maintaining the time complexity of pointwise evaluation. Finally, leveraging the evaluation results of 17 mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate the usage of Feedbacker and highlight its effectiveness and potential.

  BERTopic is a topic modeling algorithm that leverages transformer-based embeddings to create dense clusters, enabling the estimation of topic structures and the extraction of valuable insights from a corpus of documents. This approach allows users to efficiently process large-scale text data and gain meaningful insights into its structure. While BERTopic is a powerful tool, embedding preparation can vary, including extracting representations from intermediate model layers and applying transformations to these embeddings. In this study, we evaluate 18 different embedding representations and present findings based on experiments conducted on three diverse datasets. To assess the algorithm's performance, we report topic coherence and topic diversity metrics across all experiments. Our results demonstrate that, for each dataset, it is possible to find an embedding configuration that performs better than the default setting of BERTopic. Additionally, we investigate the influence of stop words on different embedding configurations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decoder-only transformer networks have become incredibly popular for language modeling tasks. State-of-the-art models can have over a hundred transformer blocks, containing billions of trainable parameters, and are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Each transformer block typically consists of a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism and a two-layer fully connected feedforward network (FFN). In this paper, we examine the importance of the FFN during the model pre-training process through a series of experiments, confirming that the FFN is important to model performance. Furthermore, we show that models using a transformer block configuration with three-layer FFNs with fewer such blocks outperform the standard two-layer configuration delivering lower training loss with fewer total parameters in less time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-domain sentiment classification aims to mitigate poor performance models due to the scarcity of labeled data in a single domain, by utilizing data labeled from various domains. A series of models that jointly train domain classifiers and sentiment classifiers have demonstrated their advantages, because domain classification helps generate necessary information for sentiment classification. Intuitively, the importance of sentiment classification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment classification; but domain classification tasks are different because the impact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across different fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper parameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing hyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1) tremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3) high algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information required for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic information modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which would control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields, is determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware modulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input text, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method. In summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset containing 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.

  _Arezoo Hatefi, Xuan-Son Vu, Monowar Bhuyan, Frank Drewes_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We extend and study a semi-supervised model for text classification proposed earlier by Hatefi et al. for classification tasks in which document classes are described by a small number of gold-labeled examples, while the majority of training examples is unlabeled. The model leverages the teacher-student architecture of Meta Pseudo Labels in which a ''teacher'' generates labels for originally unlabeled training data to train the ''student'' and updates its own model iteratively based on the performance of the student on the gold-labeled portion of the data. We extend the original model of Hatefi et al. by an unsupervised pre-training phase based on objective masking, and conduct in-depth performance evaluations of the original model, our extension, and various independent baselines. Experiments are performed using three different datasets in two different languages (English and Swedish).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on ascertaining the logical relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) between a given premise and hypothesis. This task presents significant challenges due to inherent linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI, prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths, operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis. By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the input pair. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on several standard NLI benchmark datasets reveal consistent performance gains achieved by CIRN over competitive baseline approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-level interactive features for complex relational reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling semantic relevance has always been a challenging and critical task in natural language processing. In recent years, with the emergence of massive amounts of annotated data, it has become feasible to train complex models, such as neural network-based reasoning models. These models have shown excellent performance in practical applications and have achieved the current state-ofthe-art performance. However, even with such large-scale annotated data, we still need to think: Can machines learn all the knowledge necessary to perform semantic relevance detection tasks based on this data alone? If not, how can neural network-based models incorporate external knowledge into themselves, and how can relevance detection models be constructed to make full use of external knowledge? In this paper, we use external knowledge to enhance the pre-trained semantic relevance discrimination model. Experimental results on 10 public datasets show that our method achieves consistent improvements in performance compared to the baseline model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion for Persian presents unique challenges due to its complex phonological features, particularly homographs and Ezafe, which exist in formal and informal language contexts. This paper introduces an intermediate language specifically designed for Persian language processing that addresses these challenges through a multi-faceted approach. Our methodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration architecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for constructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple pronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept analysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct datasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the B-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme conversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics, establishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy. This work contributes to the growing research in low-resource language processing and provides a robust solution for Persian text-to-speech systems and demonstrating its applicability beyond Persian. Specifically, the approach can extend to languages with rich homographic phenomena such as Chinese and Arabic

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to balance visual and textual information when summarizing complex multimodal inputs, such as entire TV show episodes. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot video-to-text summarization approach that builds its own screenplay representation of an episode, effectively integrating key video moments, dialogue, and character information into a unified document. Unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously generate screenplays and name the characters in zero-shot, using only the audio, video, and transcripts as input. Additionally, we highlight that existing summarization metrics can fail to assess the multimodal content in summaries. To address this, we introduce MFactSum, a multimodal metric that evaluates summaries with respect to both vision and text modalities. Using MFactSum, we evaluate our screenplay summaries on the SummScreen3D dataset, demonstrating superiority against state-of-the-art VLMs such as Gemini 1.5 by generating summaries containing 20% more relevant visual information while requiring 75% less of the video as input.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference, where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2) response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR. Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in numerous few-shot or zero-shot Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, creating human-annotated instruction data is time-consuming, expensive, and often limited in quantity and task diversity. Previous research endeavors have attempted to address this challenge by proposing frameworks capable of generating instructions in a semi-automated and task-agnostic manner directly from the model itself. Many of these efforts have relied on large API-only parameter-based models such as GPT-3.5 (175B), which are expensive, and subject to limits on a number of queries. This paper explores the performance of three open-source small LLMs such as LLaMA 2-7B, LLama 2-13B, and Mistral 7B, using a semi-automated framework, thereby reducing human intervention, effort, and cost required to generate an instruction dataset for fine-tuning LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based training algorithm into this LLMs-based framework leads to further enhancements. Our evaluation of the dataset reveals that these RL-based frameworks achieve a substantial improvements in 63-66% of the tasks compared to previous approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) has demonstrated broad application potential, yet their safety and reliability remain critical concerns that require systematic exploration. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, a long thought process in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a potential approach to addressing safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on scientific reasoning tasks (e.g., ScienceQA). However, most existing benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have significantly expanded LLM agents' capability to interact dynamically with external tools and APIs. However, existing tool selection frameworks do not integrate MCP servers, instead relying heavily on error-prone manual updates to monolithic local tool repositories, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies. Additionally, current approaches abstract tool selection before the LLM agent is invoked, limiting its autonomy and hindering dynamic re-querying capabilities during multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we introduce ScaleMCP, a novel tool selection approach that dynamically equips LLM agents with a MCP tool retriever, giving agents the autonomy to add tools into their memory, as well as an auto-synchronizing tool storage system pipeline through CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with MCP servers as the single source of truth. We also propose a novel embedding strategy, Tool Document Weighted Average (TDWA), designed to selectively emphasize critical components of tool documents (e.g. tool name or synthetic questions) during the embedding process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a created dataset of 5,000 financial metric MCP servers, across 10 LLM models, 5 embedding models, and 5 retriever types, demonstrate substantial improvements in tool retrieval and agent invocation performance, emphasizing ScaleMCP's effectiveness in scalable, dynamic tool selection and invocation.

  Proper names in Arabic Wikipedia are frequently undiacritized, creating ambiguity in pronunciation and interpretation, especially for transliterated named entities of foreign origin. While transliteration and diacritization have been well-studied separately in Arabic NLP,their intersection remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new manually diacritized dataset of Arabic proper names of various origins with their English Wikipedia equivalent glosses, and present the challenges and guidelines we followed to create it. We benchmark GPT-4o on the task of recovering full diacritization given the undiacritized Arabic and English forms, and analyze its performance. Achieving 73% accuracy, our results underscore both the difficulty of the task and the need for improved models and resources. We release our dataset to facilitate further research on Arabic Wikipedia proper name diacritization.

  Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal strategy for extending their functionality beyond text space. To enhance LLMs' tool-calling abilities, previous approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with trajectories distilled from stronger models, often resulting in imitative reasoning that limits generalization. In this work, we explore rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance tool-calling in LLMs, resulting in Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1, a series of tool-calling reasoning models. Rather than enforcing supervision over intermediate distilled reasoning traces, Tool-N1 is trained with a binary RL reward that assesses only the format validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to develop reasoning strategies independently, without relying on annotated trajectories. Experiments on several major benchmarks show that Tool-N1-7B/14B clearly outperform GPT-4o. We conduct a systematic study on the design of rule-based reinforcement learning strategies for training tool-calling models. Using 5,518 distilled reasoning trajectories, we compare SFT, RL, and the SFT-then-RL pipeline, finding that the widely adopted SFT-then-RL paradigm does not necessarily outperform pure RL.

  Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method, translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code and human evaluation data, has been released to the community:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflows, facilitating their integration into various systems. Many such NLP systems, including ours, directly incorporate LLMs. However, this approach either results in expensive costs or yields suboptimal performance after fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline, comprising prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression, to effectively tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Its high cost-efficiency is manifested not only in simplifying system complexity and producing super-tiny online models with enhanced performance and reduced costs in the results, but also in addressing development cycle constraints, the lack of extensive high-quality data, and limited computational resources during the project development process. In the first stage, we construct an optimal performance prototype system by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, which serves as a teacher model to generate high-quality data. In the second stage, we combine techniques like rejection sampling fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to 0.5B student models, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. In the final stage, we further compress models to 0.4B via quantization and pruning, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. Extensive experimental results and the framework's modular design suggest cross-domain capabilities and potential applicability in other NLP areas.

  Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which complicates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.

  Multimodal Reward Models (MM-RMs) are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, particularly as LLMs increasingly interact with multimodal data. However, we find that MM-RMs trained on existing datasets often struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution data due to their reliance on unimodal spurious correlations, primarily text-only shortcuts within the training distribution, which prevents them from leveraging true multimodal reward functions. To address this, we introduce a Shortcut-aware MM-RM learning algorithm that mitigates this issue by dynamically reweighting training samples, shifting the distribution toward better multimodal understanding, and reducing dependence on unimodal spurious correlations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, downstream task performance, and scalability, establishing a more robust framework for multimodal reward modeling.

  SemEval-2025 Task 3 (Mu-SHROOM) focuses on detecting hallucinations in content generated by various large language models (LLMs) across multiple languages. This task involves not only identifying the presence of hallucinations but also pinpointing their specific occurrences. To tackle this challenge, this study introduces two methods: modified RefChecker and modified SelfCheckGPT. The modified RefChecker integrates prompt-based factual verification into References, structuring them as claim-based tests rather than single external knowledge sources. The modified SelfCheckGPT incorporates external knowledge to overcome its reliance on internal knowledge. In addition, both methods' original prompt designs are enhanced to identify hallucinated words within LLM-generated texts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving a high ranking on the test dataset in detecting hallucinations across various languages, with an average IoU of 0.5310 and an average COR of 0.5669.

  The increasing integration of large language model (LLM) based conversational agents into everyday life raises critical cognitive and social questions about their potential to influence human opinions. Although previous studies have shown that LLM-based agents can generate persuasive content, these typically involve controlled, English-language settings. Addressing this, our preregistered study explored LLM's persuasive capabilities in more ecological, unconstrained scenarios, examining both static (written paragraphs) and dynamic (conversations via Telegram) interaction types. Conducted entirely in Hebrew with 200 participants, the study assessed the persuasive effects of both LLM and human interlocutors on controversial civil policy topics. Results indicated that participants adopted LLM and human perspectives similarly, with significant opinion changes evident across all conditions, regardless of interlocutor type or interaction mode. Confidence levels increased significantly in most scenarios, except in static LLM interactions. These findings demonstrate LLM-based agents' robust persuasive capabilities across diverse sources and settings, highlighting their potential impact on shaping public opinions.

  _Eva S√°nchez Salido, Julio Gonzalo, Guillermo Marco_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In LLM evaluations, reasoning is often distinguished from recall/memorization by performing numerical variations to math-oriented questions. Here we introduce a general variation method for multiple-choice questions that completely dissociates the correct answer from previously seen tokens or concepts, requiring LLMs to understand and reason (rather than memorizing) in order to answer correctly. Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and Spanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset. Results show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our proposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access 2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model in our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust (DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may not be the ones with better reasoning capabilities. Also, we see larger accuracy drops in public (vs private) datasets and questions posed in their original language (vs a manual translation), which are signs of contamination and also point to a relevant role of recall/memorization in current LLMs' answers.

  Visually linking matching cues is a crucial ability in daily life, such as identifying the same person in multiple photos based on their cues, even without knowing who they are. Despite the extensive knowledge that vision-language models (VLMs) possess, it remains largely unexplored whether they are capable of performing this fundamental task. To address this, we introduce VLM2-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across eight open-source VLMs and GPT-4o, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap where even GPT-4o lags 34.80% behind humans. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues.

  Symbolic writing systems are graphical semiotic codes that are ubiquitous in modern society but are otherwise absent in the animal kingdom. Anthropological evidence suggests that the earliest forms of some writing systems originally consisted of iconic pictographs, which signify their referent via visual resemblance. While previous studies have examined the emergence and, separately, the evolution of pictographic systems through a computational lens, most employ non-naturalistic methodologies that make it difficult to draw clear analogies to human and animal cognition. We develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning testbed for emergent communication called a Signification Game, and formulate a model of inferential communication that enables agents to leverage visual theory of mind to communicate actions using pictographs. Our model, which is situated within a broader formalism for animal communication, sheds light on the cognitive and cultural processes underlying the emergence of proto-writing.

  _Bo Gao, Michael W. Spratling_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by decomposing the Softmax operation into a non-linear transformation and the $l_1$-norm. We identify the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. By replacing the non-linear transformation with the Softplus activation function and introducing a dynamic scale factor for different token lengths based on invariance entropy, we create a novel attention mechanism with performance better than conventional Softmax attention across various inference lengths. To further improve the length extrapolation ability of the proposed attention mechanism, we introduce a novel re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attention weights while diminishing weaker ones, enabling the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens. When combined with our proposed attention mechanism, this approach maintains nearly constant validation loss even at 16$\times$ the training token length, ensures numerical stability, and achieves superior results on downstream benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress in mathematical reasoning, yet often rely on single-paradigm reasoning, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. We introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a novel unified framework integrating multiple reasoning paradigms--Natural Language Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning (SR)--to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential answers via different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy for models to progressively master these paradigms, leading to CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving and a 15.0% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic tasks. These results show the enhanced mathematical comprehension ability of our model, enabling zero-shot generalization across tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in environmental perception, reasoning-based decision-making, and simulating complex human behaviors, particularly in interactive role-playing contexts. This paper introduces the Multiverse Interactive Role-play Ability General Evaluation (MIRAGE), a comprehensive framework designed to assess LLMs' proficiency in portraying advanced human behaviors through murder mystery games. MIRAGE features eight intricately crafted scripts encompassing diverse themes and styles, providing a rich simulation. To evaluate LLMs' performance, MIRAGE employs four distinct methods: the Trust Inclination Index (TII) to measure dynamics of trust and suspicion, the Clue Investigation Capability (CIC) to measure LLMs' capability of conducting information, the Interactivity Capability Index (ICI) to assess role-playing capabilities and the Script Compliance Index (SCI) to assess LLMs' capability of understanding and following instructions. Our experiments indicate that even popular models like GPT-4 face significant challenges in navigating the complexities presented by the MIRAGE. The datasets and simulation codes are available in \href{this https URL}{github}.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external information to enhance response accuracy for queries. This approach is widely applied in several fields by taking its advantage of injecting the most up-to-date information, and researchers are focusing on understanding and improving this aspect to unlock the full potential of RAG in such high-stakes applications. However, despite the potential of RAG to address these needs, the mechanisms behind the confidence levels of its outputs remain underexplored, although the confidence of information is very critical in some domains, such as finance, healthcare, and medicine. Our study focuses the impact of RAG on confidence within the medical domain under various configurations and models. We evaluate confidence by treating the model's predicted probability as its output and calculating Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) scores based on the probabilities and accuracy. In addition, we analyze whether the order of retrieved documents within prompts calibrates the confidence. Our findings reveal large variation in confidence and accuracy depending on the model, settings, and the format of input prompts. These results underscore the necessity of optimizing configurations based on the specific model and conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Both encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and large language models (LLMs, e.g., Llama3) have been widely used for text classification tasks. However, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing the performance of encoder-based models and LLMs in text classification, particularly when fine-tuning is involved. This study employed a diverse range of models and methods, varying in size and architecture, and including both fine-tuned and pre-trained approaches. We first assessed the performances of these LLMs on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and MASSIVE datasets, comparing them to encoder-only RoBERTa models. Additionally, we explored the multi-task capabilities of both model types by combining multiple classification tasks, including intent detection and slot-filling, into a single model using data from both datasets. Our results indicate that fully fine-tuned Llama3-70B models outperform RoBERTa-large and other decoder LLMs across various classification tasks and datasets. Moreover, the consolidated multi-task fine-tuned LLMs matched the performance of dual-model setups in both tasks across both datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of encoder-only and LLM models on text classification tasks and demonstrates a method to combine two or more fully fine-tuned decoder LLMs for reduced latency and equivalent performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.

  We have uncovered a powerful jailbreak technique that leverages large language models' ability to diverge from prior context, enabling them to bypass safety constraints and generate harmful outputs. By simply instructing the LLM to deviate and obfuscate previous attacks, our method dramatically outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to a 62.83% higher success rate in compromising ten leading chatbots, including GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama, while using only 12.9% of the queries. This revelation exposes a critical flaw in current LLM safety training, suggesting that existing methods may merely mask vulnerabilities rather than eliminate them. Our findings sound an urgent alarm for the need to revolutionize testing methodologies to ensure robust and reliable LLM security.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural-language assistants are designed to provide users with helpful responses while avoiding harmful outputs, largely achieved through alignment to human preferences. Yet there is limited understanding of whether alignment techniques may inadvertently perpetuate or even amplify harmful biases inherited from their pre-aligned base models. This issue is compounded by the choice of bias evaluation benchmarks in popular preference-finetuned models, which predominantly focus on dominant social categories, such as binary gender, thereby limiting insights into biases affecting underrepresented groups. Towards addressing this gap, we center transgender, nonbinary, and other gender-diverse identities to investigate how alignment procedures interact with pre-existing gender-diverse bias in LLMs. Our key contributions include: 1) a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation modalities across leading preference-finetuned LLMs, highlighting critical gaps in gender-diverse representation, 2) systematic evaluation of gender-diverse biases across 16 models spanning Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) stages, uncovering harms popular bias benchmarks fail to detect, and 3) a flexible framework for measuring harmful biases in implicit reward signals applicable to other social contexts. Our findings reveal that DPO-aligned models are particularly sensitive to supervised finetuning (SFT), and can amplify two forms of real-world gender-diverse harms from their base models: stigmatization and gender non-affirmative language. We conclude with recommendations tailored to DPO and broader alignment practices, advocating for the adoption of community-informed bias evaluation frameworks to more effectively identify and address underrepresented harms in LLMs.

  Story-writing is a fundamental aspect of human imagination, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, effective, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence cue-word-based creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. Multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination. These approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 50 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our case studies focus on detecting direct, instance-level data contamination, which is also referred to as Membership Inference Attacks (MIA). Our analysis reveals that MIA approaches based on these three assumptions can have similar performance to random guessing, on datasets used in LLM pretraining, suggesting that current LLMs might learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Meanwhile, MIA can easily fail when there are data distribution shifts between the seen and unseen instances.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite extensive safety measures, LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial inputs, or jailbreaks, which can elicit unsafe behaviors. In this work, we introduce bijection learning, a powerful attack algorithm which automatically fuzzes LLMs for safety vulnerabilities using randomly-generated encodings whose complexity can be tightly controlled. We leverage in-context learning to teach models bijective encodings, pass encoded queries to the model to bypass built-in safety mechanisms, and finally decode responses back into English. Our attack is extremely effective on a wide range of frontier language models. Moreover, by controlling complexity parameters such as number of key-value mappings in the encodings, we find a close relationship between the capability level of the attacked LLM and the average complexity of the most effective bijection attacks. Our work highlights that new vulnerabilities in frontier models can emerge with scale: more capable models are more severely jailbroken by bijection attacks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to map biomedical ontology terms to their corresponding ontology IDs across the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Gene Ontology (GO), and UniProtKB terminologies. Using counts of ontology IDs in the PubMed Central (PMC) dataset as a surrogate for their prevalence in the biomedical literature, we examined the relationship between ontology ID prevalence and mapping accuracy. Results indicate that ontology ID prevalence strongly predicts accurate mapping of HPO terms to HPO IDs, GO terms to GO IDs, and protein names to UniProtKB accession numbers. Higher prevalence of ontology IDs in the biomedical literature correlated with higher mapping accuracy. Predictive models based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed this relationship.In contrast, this pattern did not apply to mapping protein names to Human Genome Organisation's (HUGO) gene symbols. GPT-4 achieved a high baseline performance (95%) in mapping protein names to HUGO gene symbols, with mapping accuracy unaffected by prevalence. We propose that the high prevalence of HUGO gene symbols in the literature has caused these symbols to become lexicalized, enabling GPT-4 to map protein names to HUGO gene symbols with high accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in mapping ontology terms to low-prevalence ontology IDs and underscore the importance of incorporating ontology ID prevalence into the training and evaluation of LLMs for biomedical applications.

  Quantization has gained attention as a promising solution for the cost-effective deployment of large and small language models. However, most prior work has been limited to perplexity or basic knowledge tasks and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of recent models like Llama-3.3. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of instruction-tuned models spanning 1B to 405B parameters, applying four quantization methods across 13 datasets. Our findings reveal that (1) quantized models generally surpass smaller FP16 baselines, yet they often struggle with instruction-following and hallucination detection; (2) FP8 consistently emerges as the most robust option across tasks, and AWQ tends to outperform GPTQ in weight-only quantization; (3) smaller models can suffer severe accuracy drops at 4-bit quantization, while 70B-scale models maintain stable performance; (4) notably, \textit{hard} tasks do not always experience the largest accuracy losses, indicating that quantization magnifies a model's inherent weaknesses rather than simply correlating with task difficulty; and (5) an LLM-based judge (MT-Bench) highlights significant performance declines in Coding and STEM tasks, though it occasionally reports improvements in reasoning.

  The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for program code generation has gained substantial attention, but their biases and limitations with non-English prompts challenge global inclusivity. This paper investigates the complexities of multilingual prompt-based code generation. Our evaluations of LLMs, including CODELLAMA and CODEGEMMA, reveal significant disparities in code quality for non-English prompts; we also demonstrate the inadequacy of simple approaches like prompt translation, bootstrapped data augmentation, and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a zero-shot cross-lingual approach using a neural projection technique, integrating a cross-lingual encoder like LASER to map multilingual embeddings from it into the LLM's token space. This method requires training only on English data and scales effectively to other languages. Results on a translated and quality-checked MBPP dataset show substantial improvements in code quality. This research promotes a more inclusive code generation landscape by empowering LLMs with multilingual capabilities to support the diverse linguistic spectrum in programming.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Models trained on real-world data often mirror and exacerbate existing social biases. Traditional methods for mitigating these biases typically require prior knowledge of the specific biases to be addressed, such as gender or racial biases, and the social groups associated with each instance. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial training strategy that operates independently of prior bias-type knowledge and protected attribute labels. Our approach proactively identifies biases during model training by utilizing auxiliary models, which are trained concurrently by predicting the performance of the main model without relying on task labels. Additionally, we implement these auxiliary models at various levels of the feature maps of the main model, enabling the detection of a broader and more nuanced range of bias features. Through experiments on racial and gender biases in sentiment and occupation classification tasks, our method effectively reduces social biases without the need for demographic annotations. Moreover, our approach not only matches but often surpasses the efficacy of methods that require detailed demographic insights, marking a significant advancement in bias mitigation techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.

  The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution. We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses. First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment. Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation. Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response. Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models? Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning. A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other. Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis. They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning. Our code and data is available atthis https URL.

  Sentiment Analysis (SA) is a crucial aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP), addressing subjective assessments in textual content. Syntactic parsing is useful in SA because explicit syntactic information can improve accuracy while providing explainability, but it tends to be a computational bottleneck in practice due to the slowness of parsing algorithms. This paper addresses said bottleneck by using a SEquence Labeling Syntactic Parser (SELSP) to inject syntax into SA. By treating dependency parsing as a sequence labeling problem, we greatly enhance the speed of syntax-based SA. SELSP is trained and evaluated on a ternary polarity classification task, demonstrating its faster performance and better accuracy in polarity prediction tasks compared to conventional parsers like Stanza and to heuristic approaches that use shallow syntactic rules for SA like VADER. This increased speed and improved accuracy make SELSP particularly appealing to SA practitioners in both research and industry. In addition, we test several sentiment dictionaries on our SELSP to see which one improves the performance in polarity prediction tasks. Moreover, we compare the SELSP with Transformer-based models trained on a 5-label classification task. The results show that dictionaries that capture polarity judgment variation provide better results than dictionaries that ignore polarity judgment variation. Moreover, we show that SELSP is considerably faster than Transformer-based models in polarity prediction tasks.

  This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google AI Studio, and Cloud Vertex AI.

  Clickbait, which aims to induce users with some surprising and even thrilling headlines for increasing click-through rates, permeates almost all online content publishers, such as news portals and social media. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful instrument and achieved tremendous success in a series of NLP downstream tasks. However, it is not yet known whether LLMs can be served as a high-quality clickbait detection system. In this paper, we analyze the performance of LLMs in the few-shot and zero-shot scenarios on several English and Chinese benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that LLMs cannot achieve the best results compared to the state-of-the-art deep and fine-tuning PLMs methods. Different from human intuition, the experiments demonstrated that LLMs cannot make satisfied clickbait detection just by the headlines.

  Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.

  Conventional wisdom suggests that autoregressive models are used to process discrete data. When applied to continuous modalities such as visual data, Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) typically resorts to quantization-based approaches to cast the data into a discrete space, which can introduce significant information loss. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Continuous VAR framework that enables direct visual autoregressive generation without vector quantization. The underlying theoretical foundation is strictly proper scoring rules, which provide powerful statistical tools capable of evaluating how well a generative model approximates the true distribution. Within this framework, all we need is to select a strictly proper score and set it as the training objective to optimize. We primarily explore a class of training objectives based on the energy score, which is likelihood-free and thus overcomes the difficulty of making probabilistic predictions in the continuous space. Previous efforts on continuous autoregressive generation, such as GIVT and diffusion loss, can also be derived from our framework using other strictly proper scores. Source code:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the 2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.

  We introduce a new type of foundational model for parsing human anatomy in medical images that works for different modalities. It supports supervised or unsupervised training and can perform matching, registration, classification, or segmentation with or without user interaction. We achieve this by training a neural network estimator that maps query locations to atlas coordinates via regression. Efficiency is improved by sparsely sampling the input, enabling response times of less than 1 ms without additional accelerator hardware. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in both CT and MRI modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting AI-synthetic faces presents a critical challenge: it is hard to capture consistent structural relationships between facial regions across diverse generation techniques. Current methods, which focus on specific artifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted with novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce Layer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer designed for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct Region-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation (LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create regional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural inconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM module dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights and gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the behavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across network depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle, hierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such as GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT demonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45% improvement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results demonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for reliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.

  In this work, we enable gamers to share their gaming experience on social media by automatically generating eye-catching highlight reels from their gameplay session Our automation will save time for gamers while increasing audience engagement. We approach the highlight generation problem by first identifying intervals in the video where interesting events occur and then concatenate them. We developed an in-house gameplay event detection dataset containing interesting events annotated by humans using VIA video annotator. Traditional techniques for highlight detection such as game engine integration requires expensive collaboration with game developers. OCR techniques which detect patches of specific images or texts require expensive per game engineering and may not generalize across game UI and different language. We finetuned a multimodal general purpose video understanding model such as X-CLIP using our dataset which generalizes across multiple games in a genre without per game engineering. Prompt engineering was performed to improve the classification performance of this multimodal model. Our evaluation showed that such a finetuned model can detect interesting events in first person shooting games from unseen gameplay footage with more than 90% accuracy. Moreover, our model performed significantly better on low resource games (small dataset) when trained along with high resource games, showing signs of transfer learning. To make the model production ready, we used ONNX libraries to enable cross platform inference. These libraries also provide post training quantization tools to reduce model size and inference time for deployment. ONNX runtime libraries with DirectML backend were used to perform efficient inference on Windows OS. We show that natural language supervision in the X-CLIP model leads to data efficient and highly performant video recognition models.

  Event-based object detection has gained increasing attention due to its advantages such as high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event representation format. We evaluated the HsVT model on GEN1 and Fall Detection datasets across various model sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT achieves significant performance improvements in event detection with fewer parameters.

  Measuring how real images look is a complex task in artificial intelligence research. For example, an image of a boy with a vacuum cleaner in a desert violates common sense. We introduce a novel method, which we call Through the Looking Glass (TLG), to assess image common sense consistency using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Transformer-based encoder. By leveraging LVLMs to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts. We proceed by fine-tuning a compact attention-pooling classifier over encoded atomic facts. Our TLG has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on the WHOOPS! and WEIRD datasets while leveraging a compact fine-tuning component.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data to enhance model performance, addressing the limitations of fully supervised approaches. Among its strategies, pseudo-supervision has proven highly effective, typically relying on one or multiple teacher networks to refine pseudo-labels before training a student network. A common practice in pseudo-supervision is filtering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy. However, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which are often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic feedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of relying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise true-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts thresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label filtering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative pseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without manual threshold tuning. Our method seamlessly integrates into existing pseudo-supervision frameworks and significantly improves segmentation performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating ENCORE with existing pseudo-supervision frameworks enhances performance across multiple datasets and network architectures, validating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study aims to address the problem of multi-domain task incremental learning~(MTIL), which requires that vision-language models~(VLMs) continuously acquire new knowledge while maintaining their inherent zero-shot recognition capability. Existing paradigms delegate the testing of unseen-domain samples to the original CLIP, which only prevents the degradation of the model's zero-shot capability but fails to enhance the generalization of the VLM further. To this end, we propose a novel MTIL framework, named AFA, which comprises two core modules: (1) an against forward-forgetting adapter that learns task-invariant information for each dataset in the incremental tasks to enhance the zero-shot recognition ability of VLMs; (2) an against backward-forgetting adapter that strengthens the few-shot learning capability of VLMs while supporting incremental learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially in few-shot MTIL tasks, and surpasses the inherent zero-shot performance of CLIP in terms of transferability. The code is provided in the Supplementary Material.

  Automated Radiology report generation (RRG) aims at producing detailed descriptions of medical images, reducing radiologists' workload and improving access to high-quality diagnostic services. Existing encoder-decoder models only rely on visual features extracted from raw input images, which can limit the understanding of spatial structures and semantic relationships, often resulting in suboptimal text generation. To address this, we propose Anatomical Attention Alignment Network (A3Net), a framework that enhance visual-textual understanding by constructing hyper-visual representations. Our approach integrates a knowledge dictionary of anatomical structures with patch-level visual features, enabling the model to effectively associate image regions with their corresponding anatomical entities. This structured representation improves semantic reasoning, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and clinical relevance of generated reports. Experimental results on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that A3Net significantly improves both visual perception and text generation quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current diffusion-based text-to-video methods are limited to producing short video clips of a single shot and lack the capability to generate multi-shot videos with discrete transitions where the same character performs distinct activities across the same or different backgrounds. To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number, duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control, outperforming the baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-view geo-localization is a promising solution for large-scale localization problems, requiring the sequential execution of retrieval and metric localization tasks to achieve fine-grained predictions. However, existing methods typically focus on designing standalone models for these two tasks, resulting in inefficient collaboration and increased training overhead. In this paper, we propose UnifyGeo, a novel unified hierarchical geo-localization framework that integrates retrieval and metric localization tasks into a single network. Specifically, we first employ a unified learning strategy with shared parameters to jointly learn multi-granularity representation, facilitating mutual reinforcement between these two tasks. Subsequently, we design a re-ranking mechanism guided by a dedicated loss function, which enhances geo-localization performance by improving both retrieval accuracy and metric localization references. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnifyGeo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both task-isolated and task-associated settings. Remarkably, on the challenging VIGOR benchmark, which supports fine-grained localization evaluation, the 1-meter-level localization recall rate improves from 1.53\% to 39.64\% and from 0.43\% to 25.58\% under same-area and cross-area evaluations, respectively. Code will be made publicly available.

We introduce a benchmark for VAD in the semiconductor domain by leveraging the MIIC dataset. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of modern VAD approaches in this field.

  Kidney abnormality segmentation has important potential to enhance the clinical workflow, especially in settings requiring quantitative assessments. Kidney volume could serve as an important biomarker for renal diseases, with changes in volume correlating directly with kidney function. Currently, clinical practice often relies on subjective visual assessment for evaluating kidney size and abnormalities, including tumors and cysts, which are typically staged based on diameter, volume, and anatomical location. To support a more objective and reproducible approach, this research aims to develop a robust, thoroughly validated kidney abnormality segmentation algorithm, made publicly available for clinical and research use. We employ publicly available training datasets and leverage the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation framework nnU-Net. Validation is conducted using both proprietary and public test datasets, with segmentation performance quantified by Dice coefficient and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, we analyze robustness across subgroups based on patient sex, age, CT contrast phases, and tumor histologic subtypes. Our findings demonstrate that our segmentation algorithm, trained exclusively on publicly available data, generalizes effectively to external test sets and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across all tested datasets. Subgroup analyses reveal consistent high performance, indicating strong robustness and reliability. The developed algorithm and associated code are publicly accessible atthis https URL.

  Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based sensors. These include microsecond temporal resolution, robustness under varying lighting conditions and low power consumption. Nevertheless, the effective processing of their sparse, asynchronous event streams remains challenging. Existing approaches to this problem can be categorised into two distinct groups. The first group involves the direct processing of event data with neural models, such as Spiking Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this approach is often accompanied by a compromise in terms of qualitative performance. The second group involves the conversion of events into dense representations with handcrafted aggregation functions, which can boost accuracy at the cost of temporal fidelity. This paper introduces a novel Self-Supervised Event Representation (SSER) method leveraging Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to achieve precise per-pixel encoding of event timestamps and polarities without temporal discretisation. The recurrent layers are trained in a self-supervised manner to maximise the fidelity of event-time encoding. The inference is performed with event representations generated asynchronously, thus ensuring compatibility with high-throughput sensors. The experimental validation demonstrates that SSER outperforms aggregation-based baselines, achieving improvements of 2.4% mAP and 0.6% on the Gen1 and 1 Mpx object detection datasets. Furthermore, the paper presents the first hardware implementation of recurrent representation for event data on a System-on-Chip FPGA, achieving sub-microsecond latency and power consumption between 1-2 W, suitable for real-time, power-efficient applications.

  The demand for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) to identify fraudulent ID documents in remote verification systems has significantly risen in recent years. This increase is driven by several factors, including the rise of remote work, online purchasing, migration, and advancements in synthetic images. Additionally, we have noticed a surge in the number of attacks aimed at the enrolment process. Training a PAD to detect fake ID documents is very challenging because of the limited number of ID documents available due to privacy concerns.

  Immersive video offers a 6-Dof-free viewing experience, potentially playing a key role in future video technology. Recently, 4D Gaussian Splatting has gained attention as an effective approach for immersive video due to its high rendering efficiency and quality, though maintaining quality with manageable storage remains challenging. To address this, we introduce GIFStream, a novel 4D Gaussian representation using a canonical space and a deformation field enhanced with time-dependent feature streams. These feature streams enable complex motion modeling and allow efficient compression by leveraging temporal correspondence and motion-aware pruning. Additionally, we incorporate both temporal and spatial compression networks for end-to-end compression. Experimental results show that GIFStream delivers high-quality immersive video at 30 Mbps, with real-time rendering and fast decoding on an RTX 4090. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer (Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior -- mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture -- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM. Project Page:this https URL.

  Monitoring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, even under varying physiological conditions, including those influenced by physical activity, drugs and stress, is crucial to accurately assess cardiac health. However, current AI-based methods often fail to account for how these factors interact and alter ECG patterns, ultimately limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This study introduces IKrNet, a novel neural network model, which identifies drug-specific patterns in ECGs amidst certain physiological conditions. IKrNet's architecture incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics by using a convolutional backbone with varying receptive field size to capture spatial features. A bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory module is also employed to model temporal dependencies. By treating heart rate variability as a surrogate for physiological fluctuations, we evaluated IKrNet's performance across diverse scenarios, including conditions with physical stress, drug intake alone, and a baseline without drug presence. Our assessment follows a clinical protocol in which 990 healthy volunteers were administered 80mg of Sotalol, a drug which is known to be a precursor to Torsades-de-Pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. We show that IKrNet outperforms state-of-the-art models' accuracy and stability in varying physiological conditions, underscoring its clinical viability.

We address this by introducing MAIS, a Memory-Attention mechanism for Interactive Segmentation that stores past user inputs and segmentation states, enabling temporal context integration.

  The remote embodied referring expression (REVERIE) task requires an agent to navigate through complex indoor environments and localize a remote object specified by high-level instructions, such as "bring me a spoon", without pre-exploration. Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final success. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using large language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each location. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP) and LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan from REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP generates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level instruction, and current visual observation as input. PEAP-LLM enables the embodied agent to interact with LAP as the path planner on the fly. A simple direct application of LLMs hardly achieves good performance. Also, existing hard-prompt-based methods are error-prone in complicated scenarios and need human intervention. To address these issues and prevent the LLM from generating hallucinations and biased information, we propose a novel two-stage method for fine-tuning the LLM, consisting of supervised fine-tuning (STF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). SFT improves the quality of generated instructions, while DPO utilizes environmental feedback. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model on REVERIE compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

  We propose DocVXQA, a novel framework for visually self-explainable document question answering. The framework is designed not only to produce accurate answers to questions but also to learn visual heatmaps that highlight contextually critical regions, thereby offering interpretable justifications for the model's decisions. To integrate explanations into the learning process, we quantitatively formulate explainability principles as explicit learning objectives. Unlike conventional methods that emphasize only the regions pertinent to the answer, our framework delivers explanations that are \textit{contextually sufficient} while remaining \textit{representation-efficient}. This fosters user trust while achieving a balance between predictive performance and interpretability in DocVQA applications. Extensive experiments, including human evaluation, provide strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method. The code is available atthis https URL.

  There is an increasing interest in using image-generating diffusion models for deep data augmentation and image morphing. In this context, it is useful to interpolate between latents produced by inverting a set of input images, in order to generate new images representing some mixture of the inputs. We observe that such interpolation can easily lead to degenerate results when the number of inputs is large. We analyze the cause of this effect theoretically and experimentally, and suggest a suitable remedy. The suggested approach is a relatively simple normalization scheme that is easy to use whenever interpolation between latents is needed. We measure image quality using FID and CLIP embedding distance and show experimentally that baseline interpolation methods lead to a drop in quality metrics long before the degeneration issue is clearly visible. In contrast, our method significantly reduces the degeneration effect and leads to improved quality metrics also in non-degenerate situations.

  Efficient crop-weed segmentation is critical for site-specific weed control in precision agriculture. Conventional CNN-based methods struggle to generalize and rely on RGB imagery, limiting performance under complex field conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight transformer-CNN hybrid. It processes RGB, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Red-Edge (RE) bands using specialized encoders and dynamic modality integration. Evaluated on the WeedsGalore dataset, the model achieves a segmentation accuracy (mean IoU) of 78.88%, outperforming RGB-only models by 15.8 percentage points. With only 8.7 million parameters, the model offers high accuracy, computational efficiency, and potential for real-time deployment on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and edge devices, advancing precision weed management.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art LiDAR-camera 3D object detectors usually focus on feature fusion. However, they neglect the factor of depth while designing the fusion strategy. In this work, we are the first to observe that different modalities play different roles as depth varies via statistical analysis and visualization. Based on this finding, we propose a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature Fusion (DepthFusion) strategy that guides the weights of point cloud and RGB image modalities by introducing depth encoding at both global and local levels. Specifically, the Depth-GFusion module adaptively adjusts the weights of image Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features in multi-modal global features via depth encoding. Furthermore, to compensate for the information lost when transferring raw features to the BEV space, we propose a Depth-LFusion module, which adaptively adjusts the weights of original voxel features and multi-view image features in multi-modal local features via depth encoding. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our DepthFusion method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our DepthFusion is more robust to various kinds of corruptions, outperforming previous methods on the nuScenes-C dataset.

  Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become essential for managing cities and integrating complex, heterogeneous data from diverse sources. Creating UDTs involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models' updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks. Current datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering comprehensive UDTs validation. To address these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive multimodal Urban Digital Twin benchmark dataset: TUM2TWIN. This dataset includes georeferenced, semantically aligned 3D models and networks along with various terrestrial, mobile, aerial, and satellite observations boasting 32 data subsets over roughly 100,000 $m^2$ and currently 767 GB of data. By ensuring georeferenced indoor-outdoor acquisition, high accuracy, and multimodal data integration, the benchmark supports robust analysis of sensors and the development of advanced reconstruction methods. Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar potential analysis, point cloud semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building reconstruction. We are convinced this contribution lays a foundation for overcoming current limitations in UDT creation, fostering new research directions and practical solutions for smarter, data-driven urban environments.

  Understanding the computations of convolutional neural networks requires effective visualization of their kernels. While maximal activation methods have proven successful in highlighting the preferred features of 2D convolutional kernels, directly applying these techniques to 3D convolutions often leads to uninterpretable results due to the higher dimensionality and complexity of 3D features. To address this challenge, we propose a novel visualization approach for 3D convolutional kernels that disentangles their texture and motion preferences. Our method begins with a data-driven decomposition of the optimal input that maximally activates a given kernel. We then introduce a two-stage optimization strategy to extract distinct texture and motion components from this input. Applying our approach to visualize kernels at various depths of several pre-trained models, we find that the resulting visualizations--particularly those capturing motion--clearly reveal the preferred dynamic patterns encoded by 3D kernels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing interpretable insights into 3D convolutional operations. Code is available atthis https URL.

  With the continuous increase in the number and resolution of video surveillance cameras, the burden of transmitting and storing surveillance video is growing. Traditional communication methods based on Shannon's theory are facing optimization bottlenecks. Semantic communication, as an emerging communication method, is expected to break through this bottleneck and reduce the storage and transmission consumption of video. Existing semantic decoding methods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding and decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was extracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed to reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation network was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a reference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to reconstruct video from sketch. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved significantly better video reconstruction performance than baseline methods. The sketch compression method could effectively reduce the storage and transmission consumption of semantic information with little compromise on video quality. The proposed method provides a novel semantic encoding and decoding method that only needs a few training samples for each surveillance scene, thus improving the practicality of the semantic communication system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud anomaly detection is essential for various industrial applications. The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods, necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit surface reconstruction using volume rendering techniques has recently achieved significant advancements in creating high-fidelity surfaces from multiple 2D images. However, current methods primarily target scenes with consistent illumination and struggle to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry in uncontrolled environments with transient occlusions or varying appearances. While some neural radiance field (NeRF)-based variants can better manage photometric variations and transient objects in complex scenes, they are designed for novel view synthesis rather than precise surface reconstruction due to limited surface constraints. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach that applies multiple geometric constraints to the implicit surface optimization process, enabling more accurate reconstructions from unconstrained image collections. First, we utilize sparse 3D points from structure-from-motion (SfM) to refine the signed distance function estimation for the reconstructed surface, with a displacement compensation to accommodate noise in the sparse points. Additionally, we employ robust normal priors derived from a normal predictor, enhanced by edge prior filtering and multi-view consistency constraints, to improve alignment with the actual surface geometry. Extensive testing on the Heritage-Recon benchmark and other datasets has shown that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces from in-the-wild images, yielding geometries with superior accuracy and granularity compared to existing techniques. Our approach enables high-quality 3D reconstruction of various landmarks, making it applicable to diverse scenarios such as digital preservation of cultural heritage sites.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Echocardiographers can detect pulmonary hypertension using Doppler echocardiography; however, accurately assessing its progression often proves challenging. Right heart catheterization (RHC), the gold standard for precise evaluation, is invasive and unsuitable for routine use, limiting its practicality for timely diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary hypertension progression. Here, we propose MePH, a multi-view, multi-modal vision-language model to accurately assess pulmonary hypertension progression using non-invasive echocardiography. We constructed a large dataset comprising paired standardized echocardiogram videos, spectral images and RHC data, covering 1,237 patient cases from 12 medical centers. For the first time, MePH precisely models the correlation between non-invasive multi-view, multi-modal echocardiography and the pressure and resistance obtained via RHC. We show that MePH significantly outperforms echocardiographers' assessments using echocardiography, reducing the mean absolute error in estimating mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 49.73% and 43.81%, respectively. In eight independent external hospitals, MePH achieved a mean absolute error of 3.147 for PVR assessment. Furthermore, MePH achieved an area under the curve of 0.921, surpassing echocardiographers (area under the curve of 0.842) in accurately predicting the severity of pulmonary hypertension, whether mild or severe. A prospective study demonstrated that MePH can predict treatment efficacy for patients. Our work provides pulmonary hypertension patients with a non-invasive and timely method for monitoring disease progression, improving the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary hypertension management while enabling earlier interventions and more personalized treatment decisions.

  In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background subtraction (BGS) is utilized to detect moving objects in a video and is commonly employed at the onset of object tracking and human recognition processes. Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced energy efficiency, we introduce a novel self-distillation spiking supervised learning method grounded in ANN-to-SNN frameworks, resulting in decreased power consumption. In extensive experiments conducted on CDnet-2014 and DAVIS-2016 datasets, our approach demonstrates superior segmentation performance relative to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with dynamic backgrounds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fast 3D clothed human reconstruction from monocular video remains a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with reconstruction quality. Current approaches are either focused on static image reconstruction but too computationally intensive, or achieve high quality through per-video optimization that requires minutes to hours of processing, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To this end, we present TemPoFast3D, a novel method that leverages temporal coherency of human appearance to reduce redundant computation while maintaining reconstruction quality. Our approach is a "plug-and play" solution that uniquely transforms pixel-aligned reconstruction networks to handle continuous video streams by maintaining and refining a canonical appearance representation through efficient coordinate mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemPoFast3D matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across standard metrics while providing high-quality textured reconstruction across diverse pose and appearance, with a maximum speed of 12 FPS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-Dynamic-Range Wide-Color-Gamut (HDR-WCG) technology is becoming increasingly prevalent, intensifying the demand for converting Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) content to HDR. Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone mapping operators, which are inadequate for handling SDR inputs with diverse styles commonly found in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized SDR-to-HDR method that handles diverse styles in real-world SDR content, termed Realistic Style Disentangled Representation Learning (RealRep). By disentangling luminance and chrominance, we analyze the intrinsic differences between contents with varying styles and propose a disentangled multi-view style representation learning method. This approach captures the guidance prior of true luminance and chrominance distributions across different styles, even when the SDR style distributions exhibit significant variations, thereby establishing a robust embedding space for inverse tone mapping. Motivated by the difficulty of directly utilizing degradation representation priors, we further introduce the Degradation-Domain Aware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a two-stage framework that performs adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization mechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via degradation-conditioned hierarchical features, enabling robust adaptation across diverse degradation domains. Extensive experiments show that RealRep consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior generalization and perceptually faithful HDR color gamut reconstruction.

  Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of injury and productivity loss in the manufacturing industry, incurring substantial economic costs. Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.

  In 3D Human Motion Prediction (HMP), conventional methods train HMP models with expensive motion capture data. However, the data collection cost of such motion capture data limits the data diversity, which leads to poor generalizability to unseen motions or subjects. To address this issue, this paper proposes to enhance HMP with additional learning using estimated poses from easily available videos. The 2D poses estimated from the monocular videos are carefully transformed into motion capture-style 3D motions through our pipeline. By additional learning with the obtained motions, the HMP model is adapted to the test domain. The experimental results demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative impact of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) efficiently identifies high-performing neural networks using zero-cost (ZC) proxies. Unlike multi-shot and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally, previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search, LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1 GPU days.

Our technical approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios, with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data. Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for multimodal alignment.

  Visual quality inspection in automotive production is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of vehicles. Computer vision (CV) has become a popular solution for these inspections due to its cost-effectiveness and reliability. However, CV models require large, annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. To reduce the need for extensive training data, we propose a novel image classification pipeline that combines similarity search using a vision-based foundation model with synthetic data. Our approach leverages a DINOv2 model to transform input images into feature vectors, which are then compared to pre-classified reference images using cosine distance measurements. By utilizing synthetic data instead of real images as references, our pipeline achieves high classification accuracy without relying on real data. We evaluate this approach in eight real-world inspection scenarios and demonstrate that it meets the high performance requirements of production environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work addresses the critical lack of precision in state estimation in the Kalman filter for 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and the ongoing challenge of selecting the appropriate motion model. Existing literature commonly relies on constant motion models for estimating the states of objects, neglecting the complex motion dynamics unique to each object. Consequently, trajectory division and imprecise object localization arise, especially under occlusion conditions. The core of these challenges lies in the limitations of the current Kalman filter formulation, which fails to account for the variability of motion dynamics as objects navigate their environments. This work introduces a novel formulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing the motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's movement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation, localization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman filter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent benchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\% and 0.81\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter consistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally, it shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the baseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the KITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional processing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its applicability in real-time applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision language models (LVLMs) achieve remarkable performance through Vision In-context Learning (VICL), a process that depends significantly on demonstrations retrieved from an extensive collection of annotated examples (retrieval database). Existing studies often assume that the retrieval database contains annotated examples for all labels. However, in real-world scenarios, delays in database updates or incomplete data annotation may result in the retrieval database containing labeled samples for only a subset of classes. We refer to this phenomenon as an \textbf{incomplete retrieval database} and define the in-context learning under this condition as \textbf{Incomplete In-context Learning (IICL)}. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Iterative Judgments and Integrated Prediction (IJIP)}, a two-stage framework designed to mitigate the limitations of IICL. The Iterative Judgments Stage reformulates an \(\boldsymbol{m}\)-class classification problem into a series of \(\boldsymbol{m}\) binary classification tasks, effectively converting the IICL setting into a standard VICL scenario. The Integrated Prediction Stage further refines the classification process by leveraging both the input image and the predictions from the Iterative Judgments Stage to enhance overall classification accuracy. IJIP demonstrates considerable performance across two LVLMs and two datasets under three distinct conditions of label incompleteness, achieving the highest accuracy of 93.9\%. Notably, even in scenarios where labels are fully available, IJIP still achieves the best performance of all six baselines. Furthermore, IJIP can be directly applied to \textbf{Prompt Learning} and is adaptable to the \textbf{text domain}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process transparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image and the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations between the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image information, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious visual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM (DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between local image patches and concepts. Specifically, we model the concept prediction process as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts, thereby achieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate orthogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature disentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical biases in the data, we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label statistics as transportation priors. Thus, DOT-CBM can visualize inversion heatmaps, provide more reliable concept predictions, and produce more accurate class predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks, including image classification, local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.

  Place recognition plays a significant role in SLAM, robot navigation, and autonomous driving applications. Benefiting from deep learning, the performance of LiDAR place recognition (LPR) has been greatly improved. However, many existing learning-based LPR methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which severely harms the performance of LPR on previously trained places after training on a new environment. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning framework for LPR via Knowledge Distillation and Fusion (KDF) to alleviate forgetting. Inspired by the ranking process of place recognition retrieval, we present a ranking-aware knowledge distillation loss that encourages the network to preserve the high-level place recognition knowledge. We also introduce a knowledge fusion module to integrate the knowledge of old and new models for LiDAR place recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that KDF can be applied to different networks to overcome catastrophic forgetting, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean Recall@1 and forgetting score.

  Despite significant advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are prone to producing visually ungrounded responses when interpreting associated images. In contrast, when humans embark on learning new knowledge, they often rely on a set of fundamental pre-study principles: reviewing outlines to grasp core concepts, summarizing key points to guide their focus and enhance understanding. However, such preparatory actions are notably absent in the current instruction tuning processes. This paper presents Re-Critic, an easily scalable rationale-augmented framework designed to incorporate fundamental rules and chain-of-thought (CoT) as a bridge to enhance reasoning abilities. Specifically, Re-Critic develops a visual rationale synthesizer that scalably augments raw instructions with rationale explanation. To probe more contextually grounded responses, Re-Critic employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for preference tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our rationale-augmented dataset yield gains that extend beyond hallucination-specific tasks to broader multimodal reasoning tasks.

  _Jun Li, Hongzhang Zhu, Tao Chen, Xiaohua Qian_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, numerous pancreas segmentation methods have achieved promising performance on local single-source datasets. However, these methods don't adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources. Considering the limited availability of distinct data sources, we seek to improve the generalization performance of a pancreas segmentation model trained with a single-source dataset, i.e., the single source generalization task. In particular, we propose a dual self-supervised learning model that incorporates both global and local anatomical contexts. Our model aims to fully exploit the anatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and hence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more robust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature contrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic spatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic features through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more discriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and non-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates the influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in high-uncertainty regions. Subsequently, a local-image restoration self-supervised learning module is introduced to further enhance the characterization of the high uncertainty regions. In this module, informative anatomical contexts are actually learned to recover randomly corrupted appearance patterns in those regions.

  Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a key task in industrial settings, where minimizing waste and operational costs is essential. Deploying deep learning models within Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduces specific challenges due to the limited computational power and bandwidth of edge devices. This study investigates how to perform VAD effectively under such constraints by leveraging compact and efficient processing strategies. We evaluate several data compression techniques, examining the trade-off between system latency and detection accuracy. Experiments on the MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate that significant compression can be achieved with minimal loss in anomaly detection performance compared to uncompressed data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept-based explanations have emerged as an effective approach within Explainable Artificial Intelligence, enabling interpretable insights by aligning model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, existing methods rely on computationally intensive procedures and struggle to efficiently capture complex, semantic concepts. Recently, the Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT) framework, introduced by Varshney et al. (2025), attempts to identify concepts via dimension-wise traversal of the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder trained on counterfactual trajectories. Extending the CDCT framework, this work introduces Concept Directions via Latent Clustering (CDLC), which extracts global, class-specific concept directions by clustering latent difference vectors derived from factual and diffusion-generated counterfactual image pairs. CDLC substantially reduces computational complexity by eliminating the exhaustive latent dimension traversal required in CDCT and enables the extraction of multidimensional semantic concepts encoded across the latent dimensions. This approach is validated on a real-world skin lesion dataset, demonstrating that the extracted concept directions align with clinically recognized dermoscopic features and, in some cases, reveal dataset-specific biases or unknown biomarkers. These results highlight that CDLC is interpretable, scalable, and applicable across high-stakes domains and diverse data modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated remarkable performance. Recent advancements have introduced deterministic sampling processes that reduce inference from 15 iterative steps to a single step, thereby significantly improving the inference speed of existing diffusion models. However, their efficiency remains limited when handling complex semantic regions due to the single-step inference. To address this limitation, we propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates semantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we introduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation masks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a pixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer rate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing semantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model training, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise semantic weights between predictions and ground truth. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SAMSR significantly improves perceptual quality and detail recovery, particularly in semantically complex images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation based on diffusion models presents a challenging multimodal task, with video editing emerging as a pivotal direction in this field. Recent video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232 videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to align source and target domain distributions to close the domain gap, but still struggles with obtaining the target data. Fortunately, Domain Generalization (DG) excels without the need for any target data. Recent works expose that depth maps contribute to improved generalized performance in the UDA tasks, but they ignore the noise and holes in depth maps due to device and environmental factors, failing to sufficiently and effectively learn domain-invariant representation. Although high-sensitivity region suppression has shown promising results in learning domain-invariant features, existing methods cannot be directly applicable to depth maps due to their unique characteristics. Hence, we propose a novel framework, namely Depth-Sensitive Soft Suppression with RGB-D inter-modal stylization flow (DSSS), focusing on learning domain-invariant features from depth maps for the DG semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the RGB-D inter-modal stylization flow to generate stylized depth maps for sensitivity detection, cleverly utilizing RGB information as the stylization source. Then, a class-wise soft spatial sensitivity suppression is designed to identify and emphasize non-sensitive depth features that contain more domain-invariant information. Furthermore, an RGB-D soft alignment loss is proposed to ensure that the stylized depth maps only align part of the RGB features while still retaining the unique depth information. To our best knowledge, our DSSS framework is the first work to integrate RGB and Depth information in the multi-class DG semantic segmentation task. Extensive experiments over multiple backbone networks show that our framework achieves remarkable performance improvement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fabric defect detection confronts two fundamental challenges. First, conventional non-maximum suppression disrupts gradient flow, which hinders genuine end-to-end learning. Second, acquiring pixel-level annotations at industrial scale is prohibitively costly. Addressing these limitations, we propose a differentiable NMS framework for fabric defect detection that achieves superior localization precision through end-to-end optimization. We reformulate NMS as a differentiable bipartite matching problem solved through the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, maintaining uninterrupted gradient flow throughout the network. This approach specifically targets the irregular morphologies and ambiguous boundaries of fabric defects by integrating proposal quality, feature similarity, and spatial relationships. Our entropy-constrained mask refinement mechanism further enhances localization precision through principled uncertainty modeling. Extensive experiments on the Tianchi fabric defect dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods while maintaining real-time speeds suitable for industrial deployment. The framework exhibits remarkable adaptability across different architectures and generalizes effectively to general object detection tasks.

  We present MarkMatch, a retrieval system for detecting whether two paper ballot marks were filled by the same hand. Unlike the previous SOTA method BubbleSig, which used binary classification on isolated mark pairs, MarkMatch ranks stylistic similarity between a query mark and a mark in the database using contrastive learning. Our model is trained with a dense batch similarity matrix and a dual loss objective. Each sample is contrasted against many negatives within each batch, enabling the model to learn subtle handwriting difference and improve generalization under handwriting variation and visual noise, while diagonal supervision reinforces high confidence on true matches. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.943, surpassing BubbleSig's best performance. MarkMatch also integrates Segment Anything Model for flexible mark extraction via box- or point-based prompts. The system offers election auditors a practical tool for visual, non-biometric investigation of suspicious ballots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture. However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000 image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant disease diagnostics.

  Remote physiological sensing using camera-based technologies offers transformative potential for non-invasive vital sign monitoring across healthcare and human-computer interaction domains. Although deep learning approaches have advanced the extraction of physiological signals from video data, existing methods have not been sufficiently assessed for their robustness to domain shifts. These shifts in remote physiological sensing include variations in ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, facial poses, and physiological states which often impact real-world performance significantly. Cross-dataset evaluation provides an objective measure to assess generalization capabilities across these domain shifts. We introduce Target Signal Constrained Factorization module (TSFM), a novel multidimensional attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates physiological signal characteristics as factorization constraints, allowing more precise feature extraction. Building on this innovation, we present MMRPhys, an efficient dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture designed for simultaneous multitask estimation of photoplethysmography (rPPG) and respiratory (rRSP) signals from multimodal RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MMRPhys with TSFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization across domain shifts for rPPG and rRSP estimation, while maintaining a minimal inference latency suitable for real-time applications. Our approach establishes new benchmarks for robust multitask and multimodal physiological sensing and offers a computationally efficient framework for practical deployment in unconstrained environments.

  Micro-expressions (MEs) are crucial psychological responses with significant potential for affective computing. However, current automatic micro-expression recognition (MER) research primarily focuses on discrete emotion classification, neglecting a convincing analysis of the subtle dynamic movements and inherent emotional cues. The rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), known for their strong multimodal comprehension and language generation abilities, offers new possibilities. MLLMs have shown success in various vision-language tasks, indicating their potential to understand MEs comprehensively, including both fine-grained motion patterns and underlying emotional semantics. Nevertheless, challenges remain due to the subtle intensity and short duration of MEs, as existing MLLMs are not designed to capture such delicate frame-level facial dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel Micro-Expression Large Language Model (MELLM), which incorporates a subtle facial motion perception strategy with the strong inference capabilities of MLLMs, representing the first exploration of MLLMs in the domain of ME analysis. Specifically, to explicitly guide the MLLM toward motion-sensitive regions, we construct an interpretable motion-enhanced color map by fusing onset-apex optical flow dynamics with the corresponding grayscale onset frame as the model input. Additionally, specialized fine-tuning strategies are incorporated to further enhance the model's visual perception of MEs. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-description dataset based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS) annotations and emotion labels to train our MELLM. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model exhibits superior robustness and generalization capabilities in ME understanding (MEU).

  Recently, 3D generation methods have shown their powerful ability to automate 3D model creation. However, most 3D generation methods only rely on an input image or a text prompt to generate a 3D model, which lacks the control of each component of the generated 3D model. Any modifications of the input image lead to an entire regeneration of the 3D models. In this paper, we introduce a new method called CMD that generates a 3D model from an input image while enabling flexible local editing of each component of the 3D model. In CMD, we formulate the 3D generation as a conditional multiview diffusion model, which takes the existing or known parts as conditions and generates the edited or added components. This conditional multiview diffusion model not only allows the generation of 3D models part by part but also enables local editing of 3D models according to the local revision of the input image without changing other 3D parts. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that CMD decomposes a complex 3D generation task into multiple components, improving the generation quality. Meanwhile, CMD enables efficient and flexible local editing of a 3D model by just editing one rendered image.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language. Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports. However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2 images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale, problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports, we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo:this https URL.

  Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models are hindered by high computational demands, limiting accessibility and scalability. This paper introduces KDC-Diff, a novel stable diffusion framework that enhances efficiency while maintaining image quality. KDC-Diff features a streamlined U-Net architecture with nearly half the parameters of the original U-Net (482M), significantly reducing model complexity. We propose a dual-layered distillation strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation, transferring semantic and structural insights from a teacher to a compact student model while minimizing quality degradation. Additionally, replay-based continual learning is integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, allowing the model to retain prior knowledge while adapting to new data. Despite operating under extremely low computational resources, KDC-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Oxford Flowers and Butterflies & Moths 100 Species datasets, demonstrating competitive metrics such as FID, CLIP, and LPIPS. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference time compared to existing models. These results establish KDC-Diff as a highly efficient and adaptable solution for text-to-image generation, particularly in computationally constrained environments.

  Both zero-shot and tuning-based customized text-to-image (CT2I) generation have made significant progress for storytelling content creation. In contrast, research on customized text-to-video (CT2V) generation remains relatively limited. Existing zero-shot CT2V methods suffer from poor generalization, while another line of work directly combining tuning-based T2I models with temporal motion modules often leads to the loss of structural and texture information. To bridge this gap, we propose an autoregressive structure and texture propagation module (STPM), which extracts key structural and texture features from the reference subject and injects them autoregressively into each video frame to enhance consistency. Additionally, we introduce a test-time reward optimization (TTRO) method to further refine fine-grained details. Quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of STPM and TTRO, demonstrating improvements of 7.8 and 13.1 in CLIP-I and DINO consistency metrics over the baseline, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary challenge in accelerating image super-resolution lies in reducing computation while maintaining performance and adaptability. Motivated by the observation that high-frequency regions (e.g., edges and textures) are most critical for reconstruction, we propose a training-free adaptive masking module for acceleration that dynamically focuses computation on these challenging areas. Specifically, our method first extracts high-frequency components via Gaussian blur subtraction and adaptively generates binary masks using K-means clustering to identify regions requiring intensive processing. Our method can be easily integrated with both CNNs and Transformers. For CNN-based architectures, we replace standard $3 \times 3$ convolutions with an unfold operation followed by $1 \times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-wise sparse computation guided by the mask. For Transformer-based models, we partition the mask into non-overlapping windows and selectively process tokens based on their average values. During inference, unnecessary pixels or windows are pruned, significantly reducing computation. Moreover, our method supports dilation-based mask adjustment to control the processing scope without retraining, and is robust to unseen degradations (e.g., noise, compression). Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces FLOPs by 24--43% for state-of-the-art models (e.g., CARN, SwinIR) while achieving comparable or better quantitative metrics.

  In autonomous driving, thermal image semantic segmentation has emerged as a critical research area, owing to its ability to provide robust scene understanding under adverse visual conditions. In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class distribution mismatch (CDM) refers to the discrepancy between class distributions in training data and target tasks. Previous methods address this by designing classifiers to categorize classes known during training, while grouping unknown or new classes into an "other" category. However, they focus on semi-supervised scenarios and heavily rely on labeled data, limiting their applicability and performance. To address this, we propose Unsupervised Learning for Class Distribution Mismatch (UCDM), which constructs positive-negative pairs from unlabeled data for classifier training. Our approach randomly samples images and uses a diffusion model to add or erase semantic classes, synthesizing diverse training pairs. Additionally, we introduce a confidence-based labeling mechanism that iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to valuable real-world data and incorporates them into the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UCDM's superiority over previous semi-supervised methods. Specifically, with a 60% mismatch proportion on Tiny-ImageNet dataset, our approach, without relying on labeled data, surpasses OpenMatch (with 40 labels per class) by 35.1%, 63.7%, and 72.5% in classifying known, unknown, and new classes.

  In this paper, the dual-optical attention fusion crowd head point counting model (TAPNet) is proposed to address the problem of the difficulty of accurate counting in complex scenes such as crowd dense occlusion and low light in crowd counting tasks under UAV view. The model designs a dual-optical attention fusion module (DAFP) by introducing complementary information from infrared images to improve the accuracy and robustness of all-day crowd counting. In order to fully utilize different modal information and solve the problem of inaccurate localization caused by systematic misalignment between image pairs, this paper also proposes an adaptive two-optical feature decomposition fusion module (AFDF). In addition, we optimize the training strategy to improve the model robustness through spatial random offset data augmentation.

To address the lack of ground truth in current multi-modal image registration and fusion methods, we propose a novel self-supervised \textbf{B}i-directional \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}egistration framework (\textbf{B-SR}). Specifically, B-SR utilizes a proxy data generator (PDG) and an inverse proxy data generator (IPDG) to achieve self-supervised global-local registration. Visible-infrared image pairs with spatially misaligned differences are aligned to obtain global differences through the registration module. The same image pairs are processed by PDG, such as cropping, flipping, stitching, etc., and then aligned to obtain local differences. IPDG converts the obtained local differences into pseudo-global differences, which are used to perform global-local difference consistency with the global differences. Furthermore, aiming at eliminating the effect of modal gaps on the registration module, we design a neighborhood dynamic alignment loss to achieve cross-modal image edge alignment. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in multi-modal image alignment and fusion against the competing methods. Our code will be publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite strong performance in medical question-answering, the clinical adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically hampered by their opaque 'black-box' reasoning, limiting clinician trust. This challenge is compounded by the predominant reliance of current medical LLMs on corpora from scientific literature or synthetic data, which often lack the granular expert validation and high clinical relevance essential for advancing their specialized medical capabilities. To address these critical gaps, we introduce a highly clinically relevant dataset with 31,247 medical question-answer pairs, each accompanied by expert-validated chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. This resource, spanning multiple clinical domains, was curated via a scalable human-LLM hybrid pipeline: LLM-generated rationales were iteratively reviewed, scored, and refined by medical experts against a structured rubric, with substandard outputs revised through human effort or guided LLM regeneration until expert consensus. This publicly available dataset provides a vital source for the development of medical LLMs that capable of transparent and verifiable reasoning, thereby advancing safer and more interpretable AI in medicine.

  Temporal medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision-making, yet existing methods either align images and text at a coarse level - causing potential semantic mismatches - or depend solely on visual information, lacking medical semantic integration. We present CheXLearner, the first end-to-end framework that unifies anatomical region detection, Riemannian manifold-based structure alignment, and fine-grained regional semantic guidance. Our proposed Med-Manifold Alignment Module (Med-MAM) leverages hyperbolic geometry to robustly align anatomical structures and capture pathologically meaningful discrepancies across temporal chest X-rays. By introducing regional progression descriptions as supervision, CheXLearner achieves enhanced cross-modal representation learning and supports dynamic low-level feature optimization. Experiments show that CheXLearner achieves 81.12% (+17.2%) average accuracy and 80.32% (+11.05%) F1-score on anatomical region progression detection - substantially outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially in structurally complex regions. Additionally, our model attains a 91.52% average AUC score in downstream disease classification, validating its superior feature representation.

  Generalist Medical AI (GMAI) systems have demonstrated expert-level performance in biomedical perception tasks, yet their clinical utility remains limited by inadequate multi-modal explainability and suboptimal prognostic capabilities. Here, we present XMedGPT, a clinician-centric, multi-modal AI assistant that integrates textual and visual interpretability to support transparent and trustworthy medical decision-making. XMedGPT not only produces accurate diagnostic and descriptive outputs, but also grounds referenced anatomical sites within medical images, bridging critical gaps in interpretability and enhancing clinician usability. To support real-world deployment, we introduce a reliability indexing mechanism that quantifies uncertainty through consistency-based assessment via interactive question-answering. We validate XMedGPT across four pillars: multi-modal interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and prognostic modeling, and rigorous benchmarking. The model achieves an IoU of 0.703 across 141 anatomical regions, and a Kendall's tau-b of 0.479, demonstrating strong alignment between visual rationales and clinical outcomes. For uncertainty estimation, it attains an AUC of 0.862 on visual question answering and 0.764 on radiology report generation. In survival and recurrence prediction for lung and glioma cancers, it surpasses prior leading models by 26.9%, and outperforms GPT-4o by 25.0%. Rigorous benchmarking across 347 datasets covers 40 imaging modalities and external validation spans 4 anatomical systems confirming exceptional generalizability, with performance gains surpassing existing GMAI by 20.7% for in-domain evaluation and 16.7% on 11,530 in-house data evaluation. Together, XMedGPT represents a significant leap forward in clinician-centric AI integration, offering trustworthy and scalable support for diverse healthcare applications.

  Most existing text recognition methods are trained on large-scale synthetic datasets due to the scarcity of labeled real-world datasets. Synthetic images, however, cannot faithfully reproduce real-world scenarios, such as uneven illumination, irregular layout, occlusion, and degradation, resulting in performance disparities when handling complex real-world images. Recent self-supervised learning techniques, notably contrastive learning and masked image modeling (MIM), narrow this domain gap by exploiting unlabeled real text images. This study first analyzes the original Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) and observes that random patch masking predominantly captures low-level textural features but misses high-level contextual representations. To fully exploit the high-level contextual representations, we introduce random blockwise and span masking in the text recognition task. These strategies can mask the continuous image patches and completely remove some characters, forcing the model to infer relationships among characters within a word. Our Multi-Masking Strategy (MMS) integrates random patch, blockwise, and span masking into the MIM frame, which jointly learns low and high-level textual representations. After fine-tuning with real data, MMS outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in various text-related tasks, including text recognition, segmentation, and text-image super-resolution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  According to the Pan American Health Organization, the number of cancer cases in Latin America was estimated at 4.2 million in 2022 and is projected to rise to 6.7 million by 2045. Osteosarcoma, one of the most common and deadly bone cancers affecting young people, is difficult to detect due to its unique texture and intensity. Surgical removal of osteosarcoma requires precise safety margins to ensure complete resection while preserving healthy tissue. Therefore, this study proposes a method for estimating the confidence interval of surgical safety margins in osteosarcoma surgery around the knee. The proposed approach uses MRI and X-ray data from open-source repositories, digital processing techniques, and unsupervised learning algorithms (such as k-means clustering) to define tumor boundaries. Experimental results highlight the potential for automated, patient-specific determination of safety margins.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-resolution (HR) images are pivotal for enhancing the recognition and understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, directly increasing image resolution can significantly escalate computational demands. In this study, we propose a method called Chain of Region-of-Interest (CoRoI) for Visual Instruction Tuning, aimed at alleviating the computational burden associated with high-resolution images for MLLMs. Drawing inspiration from the selective nature of the human visual system, we recognize that not all regions within high-resolution images carry equal importance. CoRoI seeks to identify and prioritize the most informative regions, thereby enhancing multimodal visual comprehension and recognition while circumventing the need for processing lengthy HR image tokens. Through extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks, we validate the efficacy of CoRoI across varying sizes, ranging from 7B to 34B in parameters. Our models consistently demonstrate superior performance across diverse multimodal benchmarks and tasks. Notably, our method outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on almost all benchmarks and our finetuned 34B model surpasses proprietary methods like Gemini Pro 1.0 on six benchmarks, as well as outperforming GPT-4V on MMB, SEED-I, and MME.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving group-robust generalization in the presence of spurious correlations remains a significant challenge, particularly when bias annotations are unavailable. Recent studies on Class-Conditional Distribution Balancing (CCDB) reveal that spurious correlations often stem from mismatches between the class-conditional and marginal distributions of bias attributes. They achieve promising results by addressing this issue through simple distribution matching in a bias-agnostic manner. However, CCDB approximates each distribution using a single Gaussian, which is overly simplistic and rarely holds in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called Bias Exploration via Overfitting (BEO), which captures each distribution in greater detail by modeling it as a mixture of latent groups. Building on these group-level descriptions, we introduce a fine-grained variant of CCDB, termed FG-CCDB, which performs more precise distribution matching and balancing within each group. Through group-level reweighting, FG-CCDB learns sample weights from a global perspective, achieving stronger mitigation of spurious correlations without incurring substantial storage or computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEO serves as a strong proxy for ground-truth bias annotations and can be seamlessly integrated with bias-supervised methods. Moreover, when combined with FG-CCDB, our method performs on par with bias-supervised approaches on binary classification tasks and significantly outperforms them in highly biased multi-class scenarios.

  A principle bottleneck in image classification is the large number of training examples needed to train a classifier. Using active learning, we can reduce the number of training examples to teach a CNN classifier by strategically selecting examples. Assigning values to image examples using different uncertainty metrics allows the model to identify and select high-value examples in a smaller training set size. We demonstrate results for digit recognition and fruit classification on the MNIST and Fruits360 data sets. We formally compare results for four different uncertainty metrics. Finally, we observe active learning is also effective on simpler (binary) classification tasks, but marked improvement from random sampling is more evident on more difficult tasks. We show active learning is a viable algorithm for image classification problems.

  Following the successful hosts of the 1-st (NLPCC 2023 Foshan) CMIVQA and the 2-rd (NLPCC 2024 Hangzhou) MMIVQA challenges, this year, a new task has been introduced to further advance research in multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop medical instructional question answering (M4IVQA) systems, with a specific focus on medical instructional videos. The M4IVQA challenge focuses on evaluating models that integrate information from medical instructional videos, understand multiple languages, and answer multi-hop questions requiring reasoning over various modalities. This task consists of three tracks: multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Temporal Answer Grounding in Single Video (M4TAGSV), multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Video Corpus Retrieval (M4VCR) and multi-modal, multilingual, and multi-hop Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (M4TAGVC). Participants in M4IVQA are expected to develop algorithms capable of processing both video and text data, understanding multilingual queries, and providing relevant answers to multi-hop medical questions. We believe the newly introduced M4IVQA challenge will drive innovations in multimodal reasoning systems for healthcare scenarios, ultimately contributing to smarter emergency response systems and more effective medical education platforms in multilingual communities.

  Multimodal news contains a wealth of information and is easily affected by deepfake modeling attacks. To combat the latest image and text generation methods, we present a new Multimodal Fake News Detection dataset (MFND) containing 11 manipulated types, designed to detect and localize highly authentic fake news. Furthermore, we propose a Shallow-Deep Multitask Learning (SDML) model for fake news, which fully uses unimodal and mutual modal features to mine the intrinsic semantics of news. Under shallow inference, we propose the momentum distillation-based light punishment contrastive learning for fine-grained uniform spatial image and text semantic alignment, and an adaptive cross-modal fusion module to enhance mutual modal features. Under deep inference, we design a two-branch framework to augment the image and text unimodal features, respectively merging with mutual modalities features, for four predictions via dedicated detection and localization projections. Experiments on both mainstream and our proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of the model. Codes and dataset are released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming, providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.

  _Yicheng Song, Tiancheng Lin, Die Peng, Su Yang, Yi Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Various multi-instance learning (MIL) based approaches have been developed and successfully applied to whole-slide pathological images (WSI). Existing MIL methods emphasize the importance of feature aggregators, but largely neglect the instance-level representation learning. They assume that the availability of a pre-trained feature extractor can be directly utilized or fine-tuned, which is not always the case. This paper proposes to pre-train feature extractor for MIL via a weakly-supervised scheme, i.e., propagating the weak bag-level labels to the corresponding instances for supervised learning. To learn effective features for MIL, we further delve into several key components, including strong data augmentation, a non-linear prediction head and the robust loss function. We conduct experiments on common large-scale WSI datasets and find it achieves better performance than other pre-training schemes (e.g., ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised learning) in different downstream tasks. We further show the compatibility and scalability of the proposed scheme by deploying it in fine-tuning the pathological-specific models and pre-training on merged multiple datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the representation learning for MIL.

  Underwater object detection using sonar imagery has become a critical and rapidly evolving research domain within marine technology. However, sonar images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of objectthis http URLaddress these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity. Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a NAS search mechanism.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robustness to label noise within data is a significant challenge in federated learning (FL). From the data-centric perspective, the data quality of distributed datasets can not be guaranteed since annotations of different clients contain complicated label noise of varying degrees, which causes the performance degradation. There have been some early attempts to tackle noisy labels in FL. However, there exists a lack of benchmark studies on comprehensively evaluating their practical performance under unified settings. To this end, we propose the first benchmark study FNBench to provide an experimental investigation which considers three diverse label noise patterns covering synthetic label noise, imperfect human-annotation errors and systematic errors. Our evaluation incorporates eighteen state-of-the-art methods over five image recognition datasets and one text classification dataset. Meanwhile, we provide observations to understand why noisy labels impair FL, and additionally exploit a representation-aware regularization method to enhance the robustness of existing methods against noisy labels based on our observations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this work and propose three-fold future directions. To facilitate related communities, our source code is open-sourced atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) are widely employed in illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) to merge the interpretability of model-based approaches with the generalization of learning-based methods. However, the performance of DUN-based methods remains considerably inferior to that of state-of-the-art IDIR solvers. Our investigation indicates that this limitation does not stem from structural shortcomings of DUNs but rather from the limited exploration of the unfolding structure, particularly for (1) constructing task-specific restoration models, (2) integrating advanced network architectures, and (3) designing DUN-specific loss functions. To address these issues, we propose a novel DUN-based method, UnfoldIR, for IDIR tasks. UnfoldIR first introduces a new IDIR model with dedicated regularization terms for smoothing illumination and enhancing texture. We unfold the iterative optimized solution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a reflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an illumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a visual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination smoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align similar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of details in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing details. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage information consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages. This loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's performance even in unsupervised settings. Experiments verify our effectiveness across 5 IDIR tasks and 3 downstream problems.

  Text-to-video generative models have achieved significant progress, driven by the rapid advancements in diffusion models, with notable examples including Pika, Luma, Kling, and Sora. Despite their remarkable generation ability, their vulnerability to jailbreak attack, i.e. to generate unsafe content, including pornography, violence, and discrimination, raises serious safety concerns. Existing efforts, such as T2VSafetyBench, have provided valuable benchmarks for evaluating the safety of text-to-video models against unsafe prompts but lack systematic studies for exploiting their vulnerabilities effectively. In this paper, we propose the \textit{first} optimization-based jailbreak attack against text-to-video models, which is specifically designed. Our approach formulates the prompt generation task as an optimization problem with three key objectives: (1) maximizing the semantic similarity between the input and generated prompts, (2) ensuring that the generated prompts can evade the safety filter of the text-to-video model, and (3) maximizing the semantic similarity between the generated videos and the original input prompts. To further enhance the robustness of the generated prompts, we introduce a prompt mutation strategy that creates multiple prompt variants in each iteration, selecting the most effective one based on the averaged score. This strategy not only improves the attack success rate but also boosts the semantic relevance of the generated video. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models, including Open-Sora, Pika, Luma, and Kling. The results demonstrate that our method not only achieves a higher attack success rate compared to baseline methods but also generates videos with greater semantic similarity to the original input prompts.

  In recent years, the rapid expansion of dataset sizes and the increasing complexity of deep learning models have significantly escalated the demand for computational resources, both for data storage and model training. Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by generating a compact synthetic dataset that retains the essential information from a large real dataset. However, existing methods often suffer from limited performance and poor data quality, particularly in the video domain. In this paper, we focus on video dataset distillation by employing a video diffusion model to generate high-quality synthetic videos. To enhance representativeness, we introduce Video Spatio-Temporal U-Net (VST-UNet), a model designed to select a diverse and informative subset of videos that effectively captures the characteristics of the original dataset. To further optimize computational efficiency, we explore a training-free clustering algorithm, Temporal-Aware Cluster-based Distillation (TAC-DT), to select representative videos without requiring additional training overhead. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating performance improvements of up to \(10.61\%\) over the state-of-the-art. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches across all datasets, establishing a new benchmark for video dataset distillation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Traditional VIF methods primarily focus on generating fused images with high visual quality, while recent advancements increasingly emphasize incorporating semantic information into the fusion model during training. However, most existing segmentation-oriented VIF methods adopt a cascade structure comprising separate fusion and segmentation models, leading to increased network complexity and redundancy. This raises a critical question: can we design a more concise and efficient structure to integrate semantic information directly into the fusion model during training-Inspired by multi-task learning, we propose a concise and universal training framework, MultiTaskVIF, for segmentation-oriented VIF models. In this framework, we introduce a multi-task head decoder (MTH) to simultaneously output both the fused image and the segmentation result during training. Unlike previous cascade training frameworks that necessitate joint training with a complete segmentation model, MultiTaskVIF enables the fusion model to learn semantic features by simply replacing its decoder with MTH. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to detect objects and their relationships in videos without being restricted by predefined object or relationship categories. Existing methods leverage the rich semantic knowledge of pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP to identify novel categories. They typically adopt a cascaded pipeline to first detect objects and then classify relationships based on the detected objects, which may lead to error propagation and thus suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Mutual EnhancemenT of Objects and Relationships (METOR), a query-based unified framework to jointly model and mutually enhance object detection and relationship classification in open-vocabulary scenarios. Under this framework, we first design a CLIP-based contextual refinement encoding module that extracts visual contexts of objects and relationships to refine the encoding of text features and object queries, thus improving the generalization of encoding to novel categories. Then we propose an iterative enhancement module to alternatively enhance the representations of objects and relationships by fully exploiting their interdependence to improve recognition performance. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  As deep learning models grow in complexity and the volume of training data increases, reducing storage and computational costs becomes increasingly important. Dataset distillation addresses this challenge by synthesizing a compact set of synthetic data that can effectively replace the original dataset in downstream classification tasks. While existing methods typically rely on mapping data from pixel space to the latent space of a generative model, we propose a novel stochastic approach that models the joint distribution of latent features. This allows our method to better capture spatial structures and produce diverse synthetic samples, which benefits model training. Specifically, we introduce a low-rank multivariate normal distribution parameterized by a lightweight network. This design maintains low computational complexity and is compatible with various matching networks used in dataset distillation. After distillation, synthetic images are generated by feeding the learned latent features into a pretrained generator. These synthetic images are then used to train classification models, and performance is evaluated on real test set. We validate our method on several benchmarks, including ImageNet subsets, CIFAR-10, and the MedMNIST histopathological dataset. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art cross architecture performance across a range of backbone architectures, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fusing and balancing multi-modal inputs from novel sensors for dense prediction tasks, particularly semantic segmentation, is critically important yet remains a significant challenge. One major limitation is the tendency of multi-modal frameworks to over-rely on easily learnable modalities, a phenomenon referred to as unimodal dominance or bias. This issue becomes especially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may be unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we apply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on functional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This term is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual modality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev inequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information. By maximizing the information contributed by each visual modality, our approach mitigates unimodal dominance and establishes a more balanced and robust segmentation framework. A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to apply our proposed plug-and-play term on high-level features and also segmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance, i.e., +13.94%, +3.25%, and +3.64%, without introducing any additional parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) enables anomaly detection models in learning new classes while preserving knowledge of historical classes. CAD faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small anomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve pixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay framework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving pixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by searching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the pre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with fine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance. However, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial diversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression, achieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation, with notable improvements in segmentation: 11.5% on VisA and 8.1% on MVTec.

  This paper proposes batch augmentation with unimodal fine-tuning to detect the fetus's organs from ultrasound images and associated clinical textual information. We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data. Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization. We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets. The multimodal large language model (LLM) with the proposed training provides the best results among the investigated methods. We receive near state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the UPMC Food-101 dataset. We share the scripts of the proposed method with traditional counterparts at the following repository:this http URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper presents a learned two-dimensional separable transform (LST) that can be considered as a new type of computational layer for constructing neural network (NN) architecture for image recognition tasks. The LST based on the idea of sharing the weights of one fullyconnected (FC) layer to process all rows of an image. After that, a second shared FC layer is used to process all columns of image representation obtained from the first layer. The use of LST layers in a NN architecture significantly reduces the number of model parameters compared to models that use stacked FC layers. We show that a NN-classifier based on a single LST layer followed by an FC layer achieves 98.02\% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, while having only 9.5k parameters. We also implemented a LST-based classifier for handwritten digit recognition on the FPGA platform to demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested approach for designing a compact and high-performance implementation of NN models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, pansharpening has seen rapid advancements with deep learning methods, which have demonstrated impressive fusion quality. However, the challenge of acquiring real high-resolution images limits the practical applicability of these methods. To address this, we propose a two-stage random alternating framework (TRA-PAN) that effectively integrates strong supervision constraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training procedure, which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spatial-spectral degradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training time and mitigate the negative effects of reduced-resolution data. In the second stage, Random Alternation Optimization (RAO) is employed, where random alternating training leverages the strengths of both reduced- and full-resolution images, further optimizing the fusion model. By primarily relying on full-resolution images, our method enables zero-shot training with just a single image pair, obviating the need for large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality in real-world scenarios, highlighting its strong practical applicability.

  _Chengfeng Wang, Wei Zhai, Yuhang Yang, Yang Cao, Zhengjun Zha_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task, existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured human point clouds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Protecting power transmission lines from potential hazards involves critical tasks, one of which is the accurate measurement of distances between power lines and potential threats, such as large cranes. The challenge with this task is that the current sensor-based methods face challenges in balancing accuracy and cost in distance measurement. A common practice is to install cameras on transmission towers, which, however, struggle to measure true 3D distances due to the lack of depth information. Although 3D lasers can provide accurate depth data, their high cost makes large-scale deployment impractical.To address this challenge, we present ElectricSight, a system designed for 3D distance measurement and monitoring of potential hazards to power transmission lines. This work's key innovations lie in both the overall system framework and a monocular depth estimation method. Specifically, the system framework combines real-time images with environmental point cloud priors, enabling cost-effective and precise 3D distance measurements. As a core component of the system, the monocular depth estimation method enhances the performance by integrating 3D point cloud data into image-based estimates, improving both the accuracy and reliability of the system.To assess ElectricSight's performance, we conducted tests with data from a real-world power transmission scenario. The experimental results demonstrate that ElectricSight achieves an average accuracy of 1.08 m for distance measurements and an early warning accuracy of 92%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image person search aims to identify an individual based on a text description. To reduce data collection costs, large-scale text-image datasets are created from co-occurrence pairs found online. However, this can introduce noise, particularly mismatched pairs, which degrade retrieval performance. Existing methods often focus on negative samples, amplifying this noise. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Uncertainty and Relational Alignment (DURA) framework, which includes the Key Feature Selector (KFS) and a new loss function, Dynamic Softmax Hinge Loss (DSH-Loss). KFS captures and models noise uncertainty, improving retrieval reliability. The bidirectional evidence from cross-modal similarity is modeled as a Dirichlet distribution, enhancing adaptability to noisy data. DSH adjusts the difficulty of negative samples to improve robustness in noisy environments. Our experiments on three datasets show that the method offers strong noise resistance and improves retrieval performance in both low- and high-noise scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task of weakly supervised temporal sentence grounding (WSTSG) aims to detect temporal intervals corresponding to a language description from untrimmed videos with only video-level video-language correspondence. For an anchor sample, most existing approaches generate negative samples either from other videos or within the same video for contrastive learning. However, some training samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding them as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the correlations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address this, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines positive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative supervision. Specifically, for a given anchor sample, we partition the remaining training set into semantically similar and dissimilar subsets based on the similarity of their text queries. To effectively leverage these correlations, we introduce a PSM-guided contrastive loss to ensure that the anchor proposal is closer to similar samples and further from dissimilar ones. Additionally, we design a PSM-guided rank loss to ensure that similar samples are closer to the anchor proposal than to the negative intra-video proposal, aiming to distinguish the anchor proposal and the negative intra-video proposal. Experiments on the WSTSG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

  Visual text rendering, which aims to accurately integrate specified textual content within generated images, is critical for various applications such as commercial design. Despite recent advances, current methods struggle with long-tail text cases, particularly when handling unseen or small-sized text. In this work, we propose a novel Hierarchical Disentangled Glyph-Based framework (HDGlyph) that hierarchically decouples text generation from non-text visual synthesis, enabling joint optimization of both common and long-tail text rendering. At the training stage, HDGlyph disentangles pixel-level representations via the Multi-Linguistic GlyphNet and the Glyph-Aware Perceptual Loss, ensuring robust rendering even for unseen characters. At inference time, HDGlyph applies Noise-Disentangled Classifier-Free Guidance and Latent-Disentangled Two-Stage Rendering (LD-TSR) scheme, which refines both background and small-sized text. Extensive evaluations show our model consistently outperforms others, with 5.08% and 11.7% accuracy gains in English and Chinese text rendering while maintaining high image quality. It also excels in long-tail scenarios with strong accuracy and visual performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress, existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fusion technique is the key to the multimodal emotion recognition task. Recently, cross-modal attention-based fusion methods have demonstrated high performance and strong robustness. However, cross-modal attention suffers from redundant features and does not capture complementary features well. We find that it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to reinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can reinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an innovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN). Specifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform intra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the selected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another modality. To better capture the complementary information between the modalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight vector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities. We apply TCAFN to the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets. For fair comparison, we use the same unimodal representations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method. The experimental results show that TACFN brings a significant performance improvement compared to other methods and reaches the state-of-the-art.

  Deepfake videos, produced through advanced artificial intelligence methods now a days, pose a new challenge to the truthfulness of the digital media. As Deepfake becomes more convincing day by day, detecting them requires advanced methods capable of identifying subtle inconsistencies. The primary motivation of this paper is to recognize deepfake videos using deep learning techniques, specifically by using convolutional neural networks. Deep learning excels in pattern recognition, hence, makes it an ideal approach for detecting the intricate manipulations in deepfakes. In this paper, we consider using MTCNN as a face detector and EfficientNet-B5 as encoder model to predict if a video is deepfake or not. We utilize training and evaluation dataset from Kaggle DFDC. The results shows that our deepfake detection model acquired 42.78% log loss, 93.80% AUC and 86.82% F1 score on kaggle's DFDC dataset.

  Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing, aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures, varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations, this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical image registration technology.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the strength of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), it struggles with generalization issues in open-vocabulary multi-entity segmentation (OVMS). Through empirical and causal analyses, we find that (i) the prompt bias is the primary cause of the generalization issues; (ii) this bias is closely tied to the task-irrelevant generating factors within the prompts, which act as confounders and affect generalization. To address the generalization issues, we aim to propose a method that can calibrate prompts to eliminate confounders for accurate OVMS. Building upon the causal analysis, we propose that the optimal prompt for OVMS should contain only task-relevant causal factors. We define it as the causal prompt, serving as the goal of calibration. Next, our theoretical analysis, grounded by causal multi-distribution consistency theory, proves that this prompt can be obtained by enforcing segmentation consistency and optimality. Inspired by this, we propose CPC-SAM, a Causal Prompt Calibration method for SAM to achieve accurate OVMS. It integrates a lightweight causal prompt learner (CaPL) into SAM to obtain causal prompts. Specifically, we first generate multiple prompts using random annotations to simulate diverse distributions and then reweight them via CaPL by enforcing causal multi-distribution consistency in both task and entity levels. To ensure obtaining causal prompts, CaPL is optimized by minimizing the cumulative segmentation loss across the reweighted prompts to achieve consistency and optimality. A bi-level optimization strategy alternates between optimizing CaPL and SAM, ensuring accurate OVMS. Extensive experiments validate its superiority.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method using long-tracked features. Long-tracked features can constrain more visual frames, reducing localization drift. However, they may also lead to accumulated matching errors and drift in feature tracking. Current VIO methods adjust observation weights based on re-projection errors, yet this approach has flaws. Re-projection errors depend on estimated camera poses and map points, so increased errors might come from estimation inaccuracies, not actual feature tracking errors. This can mislead the optimization process and make long-tracked features ineffective for suppressing localization drift. Furthermore, long-tracked features constrain a larger number of frames, which poses a significant challenge to real-time performance of the system. To tackle these issues, we propose an active decoupling mechanism for accumulated errors in long-tracked feature utilization. We introduce a visual reference frame reset strategy to eliminate accumulated tracking errors and a depth prediction strategy to leverage the long-term constraint. To ensure real time preformane, we implement three strategies for efficient system state estimation: a parallel elimination strategy based on predefined elimination order, an inverse-depth elimination simplification strategy, and an elimination skipping strategy. Experiments on various datasets show that our method offers higher positioning accuracy with relatively short consumption time, making it more suitable for edge-enabled low-altitude IoT navigation, where high-accuracy positioning and real-time operation on edge device are required.

  Quantum Dempster-Shafer Theory (QDST) uses quantum interference effects to derive a quantum mass function (QMF) as a fuzzy metric type from information obtained from various data sources. In addition, QDST uses quantum parallel computing to speed up computation. Nevertheless, the effective management of conflicts between multiple QMFs in QDST is a challenging question. This work aims to address this problem by proposing a Quantum Conflict Indicator (QCI) that measures the conflict between two QMFs in decision-making. Then, the properties of the QCI are carefully investigated. The obtained results validate its compliance with desirable conflict measurement properties such as non-negativity, symmetry, boundedness, extreme consistency and insensitivity to refinement. We then apply the proposed QCI in conflict fusion methods and compare its performance with several commonly used fusion approaches. This comparison demonstrates the superiority of the QCI-based conflict fusion method. Moreover, the Class Description Domain Space (C-DDS) and its optimized version, C-DDS+ by utilizing the QCI-based fusion method, are proposed to address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection task. The experimental results show that the proposed approach gives better OOD performance with respect to several state-of-the-art baseline OOD detection methods. Specifically, it achieves an average increase in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 1.2% and a corresponding average decrease in False Positive Rate at 95% True Negative Rate (FPR95) of 5.4% compared to the optimal baseline method.

  Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) semantic segmentation provides comprehensive environmental perception for autonomous driving but suffers multi-modal misalignment and sensor noise. We propose RESAR-BEV, a progressive refinement framework that advances beyond single-step end-to-end approaches: (1) progressive refinement through residual autoregressive learning that decomposes BEV segmentation into interpretable coarse-to-fine stages via our Drive-Transformer and Modifier-Transformer residual prediction cascaded architecture, (2) robust BEV representation combining ground-proximity voxels with adaptive height offsets and dual-path voxel feature encoding (max+attention pooling) for efficient feature extraction, and (3) decoupled supervision with offline Ground Truth decomposition and online joint optimization to prevent overfitting while ensuring structural coherence. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate RESAR-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance with 54.0% mIoU across 7 essential driving-scene categories while maintaining real-time capability at 14.6 FPS. The framework exhibits robustness in challenging scenarios of long-range perception and adverse weather conditions.

  Text-to-image synthesis has progressed to the point where models can generate visually compelling images from natural language prompts. Yet, existing methods often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations, or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014 validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints, offering a robust solution for semantically grounded imagethis http URLcode is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative Adversarial Network approaches such as StyleGAN/2 provide two key benefits: the ability to generate photo-realistic face images and possessing a semantically structured latent space from which these images are created. Many approaches have emerged for editing images derived from vectors in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN/2 models by identifying semantically meaningful directions (e.g., gender or age) in the latent space. By moving the vector in a specific direction, the ideal result would only change the target feature while preserving all the other features. Providing an ideal data augmentation approach for gesture research as it could be used to generate numerous image variations whilst keeping the facial expressions intact. However, entanglement issues, where changing one feature inevitably affects other features, impacts the ability to preserve facial expressions. To address this, we propose the use of an addition to the loss function of a Facial Keypoint Detection model to restrict changes to the facial expressions. Building on top of an existing model, adding the proposed Human Face Landmark Detection (HFLD) loss, provided by a pre-trained Facial Keypoint Detection model, to the original loss function. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the existing and our extended model, showing the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the entanglement issue and maintaining the facial expression. Our approach achieves up to 49% reduction in the change of emotion in our experiments. Moreover, we show the benefit of our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art models. By increasing the ability to preserve the facial gesture and expression during facial transformation, we present a way to create human face images with fixed expression but different appearances, making it a reliable data augmentation approach for Facial Gesture and Expression research.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been integrated into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning capabilities through tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs, they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered, potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates, camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability of VLM-augmented driving systems.

  Inferring full-body poses from Head Mounted Devices, which capture only 3-joint observations from the head and wrists, is a challenging task with wide AR/VR applications. Previous attempts focus on learning one-stage motion mapping and thus suffer from an over-large inference space for unobserved body joint motions. This often leads to unsatisfactory lower-body predictions and poor temporal consistency, resulting in unrealistic or incoherent motion sequences. To address this, we propose a powerful Multi-stage Avatar GEnerator named MAGE that factorizes this one-stage direct motion mapping learning with a progressive prediction strategy. Specifically, given initial 3-joint motions, MAGE gradually inferring multi-scale body part poses at different abstract granularity levels, starting from a 6-part body representation and gradually refining to 22 joints. With decreasing abstract levels step by step, MAGE introduces more motion context priors from former prediction stages and thus improves realistic motion completion with richer constraint conditions and less ambiguity. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets verify that MAGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better accuracy and continuity.

  Recent advancements in super-resolution for License Plate Recognition (LPR) have sought to address challenges posed by low-resolution (LR) and degraded images in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and forensic applications. However, existing studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation models. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset containing 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license plate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark using multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle -- five of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license plates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining predictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for multiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our findings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR performance, with further improvements observed when applying majority vote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and Character-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by Character Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates, increasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution, and up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images. These findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal information in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions.

  Sensor-based guidance is required for long-range platforms. To bypass the structural limitation of classical registration on reference image framework, we offer in this paper to encode a stack of images of the scene into a deep network. Relying on a stack is showed to be relevant on bimodal scene (e.g. when the scene can or can not be snowy).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical disease prediction, particularly through imaging, remains a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of medical data, including noise, ambiguity, and differing image quality. Recent deep learning models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions. Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer. Additionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student model pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization methods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated using three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a distinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving top accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on the Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset. This enhanced performance is further evidenced by the improved results, surpassing existing benchmarks of 97.24% (Kaggle), 91.43% (Figshare), and 95.00% (GastroNet).

  Lung cancer is the leading cause of patient mortality in the world. Early diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules in CT images can have a significant impact on reducing disease mortality and morbidity. In this work, we propose LMLCC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for classifying nodules from CT scan images using a 3D CNN, considering Hounsfield Unit (HU)-based intensity filtering. Benign and malignant nodules have significant differences in their intensity profile of HU, which was not exploited in the literature. Our method considers the intensity pattern as well as the texture for the prediction of malignancies. LMLCC-Net extracts features from multiple branches that each use a separate learnable HU-based intensity filtering stage. Various combinations of branches and learnable ranges of filters were explored to finally produce the best-performing model. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning scheme for labeling ambiguous cases and also developed a lightweight model to classify the nodules. The experimental evaluations are carried out on the LUNA16 dataset. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy (ACC) of 91.96%, a sensitivity (SEN) of 92.04%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 91.87%, showing improved performance compared to existing methods. The proposed method can have a significant impact in helping radiologists in the classification of pulmonary nodules and improving patient care.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining datasets are foundational to the development of multimodal models, yet they often have inherent biases and toxic content from the web-scale corpora they are sourced from. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of toxicity in LLaVA image-text pretraining dataset, examining how harmful content manifests in different modalities. We present a comprehensive analysis of common toxicity categories and propose targeted mitigation strategies, resulting in the creation of a refined toxicity-mitigated dataset. This dataset removes 7,531 of toxic image-text pairs in the LLaVA pre-training dataset. We offer guidelines for implementing robust toxicity detection pipelines. Our findings underscore the need to actively identify and filter toxic content - such as hate speech, explicit imagery, and targeted harassment - to build more responsible and equitable multimodal systems. The toxicity-mitigated dataset is open source and is available for further research.

  The generation of realistic medical images from text descriptions has significant potential to address data scarcity challenges in healthcare AI while preserving patient privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive study of text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2) training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM, an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy (MedVQA-GI) and radiology (ROCOv2) datasets reveals that while large models achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with lower computational costs. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations by medical experts reveal strengths and limitations of each approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel method that reconstructs hair strands directly from colorless 3D scans by leveraging multi-modal hair orientation extraction. Hair strand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics that can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and AR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color information. To facilitate further research, we introduce Strands400, the largest publicly available dataset of hair strands with detailed surface geometry extracted from real-world data, which contains reconstructed hair strands from the scans of 400 subjects.

  _Hongyang Zhu, Haipeng Liu, Bo Fu, Yang Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.

  _Jinyu Gu, Haipeng Liu, Meng Wang, Yang Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image. Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity information and background information. As a result, the generated images not only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+ space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space, which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate online map matching is fundamental to vehicle navigation and the activation of intelligent driving functions. Current online map matching methods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel road area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition (SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with multiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map matching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings and scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First, the lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated with the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the enriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability factor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the association probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving scenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability factor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching on elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our method through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental results show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map matching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in multilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed method achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset and test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly outperforming benchmark methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attribute bias in federated learning (FL) typically leads local models to optimize inconsistently due to the learning of non-causal associations, resulting degraded performance. Existing methods either use data augmentation for increasing sample diversity or knowledge distillation for learning invariant representations to address this problem. However, they lack a comprehensive analysis of the inference paths, and the interference from confounding factors limits their performance. To address these limitations, we propose the \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}econfounding and \underline{D}ebiasing \underline{L}earning (FedDDL) method. It constructs a structured causal graph to analyze the model inference process, and performs backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounding paths. Specifically, we design an intra-client deconfounding learning module for computer vision tasks to decouple background and objects, generating counterfactual samples that establish a connection between the background and any label, which stops the model from using the background to infer the label. Moreover, we design an inter-client debiasing learning module to construct causal prototypes to reduce the proportion of the background in prototype components. Notably, it bridges the gap between heterogeneous representations via causal prototypical regularization. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmarking datasets demonstrate that \methodname{} significantly enhances the model capability to focus on main objects in unseen data, leading to 4.5\% higher Top-1 Accuracy on average over 9 state-of-the-art existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.

  Thermal infrared (TIR) object tracking often suffers from challenges such as target occlusion, motion blur, and background clutter, which significantly degrade the performance of trackers. To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.

  The Transformer architecture has achieved significant success in natural language processing, motivating its adaptation to computer vision tasks. Unlike convolutional neural networks, vision transformers inherently capture long-range dependencies and enable parallel processing, yet lack inductive biases and efficiency benefits, facing significant computational and memory challenges that limit its real-world applicability. This paper surveys various online strategies for generating lightweight vision transformers for image recognition, focusing on three key areas: Efficient Component Design, Dynamic Network, and Knowledge Distillation. We evaluate the relevant exploration for each topic on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, analyzing trade-offs among precision, parameters, throughput, and more to highlight their respective advantages, disadvantages, and flexibility. Finally, we propose future research directions and potential challenges in the lightweighting of vision transformers with the aim of inspiring further exploration and providing practical guidance for the community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this study, we propose a method for video face reenactment that integrates a 3D face parametric model into a latent diffusion framework, aiming to improve shape consistency and motion control in existing video-based face generation approaches. Our approach employs the FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions) model as the 3D face parametric representation, providing a unified framework for modeling face expressions and head pose. This not only enables precise extraction of motion features from driving videos, but also contributes to the faithful preservation of face shape and geometry. Specifically, we enhance the latent diffusion model with rich 3D expression and detailed pose information by incorporating depth maps, normal maps, and rendering maps derived from FLAME sequences. These maps serve as motion guidance and are encoded into the denoising UNet through a specifically designed Geometric Guidance Encoder (GGE). A multi-layer feature fusion module with integrated self-attention mechanisms is used to combine facial appearance and motion latent features within the spatial domain. By utilizing the 3D face parametric model as motion guidance, our method enables parametric alignment of face identity between the reference image and the motion captured from the driving video. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our method excels at generating high-quality face animations with precise expression and head pose variation modeling. In addition, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on out-of-domain images. Code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present GarmentDiffusion, a new generative model capable of producing centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text, image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a sequence length that is 10 times shorter than that of the autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by 100 times compared to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData. The project website is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to segment objects of novel classes in new domains, which is often challenging due to the diverse characteristics of target domains and the limited availability of support data. Most CD-FSS methods redesign and retrain in-domain FSS models using various domain-generalization techniques, which are effective but costly to train. To address these issues, we propose adapting informative model structures of the well-trained FSS model for target domains by learning domain characteristics from few-shot labeled support samples during inference, thereby eliminating the need for retraining. Specifically, we first adaptively identify domain-specific model structures by measuring parameter importance using a novel structure Fisher score in a data-dependent manner. Then, we progressively train the selected informative model structures with hierarchically constructed training samples, progressing from fewer to more support shots. The resulting Informative Structure Adaptation (ISA) method effectively addresses domain shifts and equips existing well-trained in-domain FSS models with flexible adaptation capabilities for new domains, eliminating the need to redesign or retrain CD-FSS models on base data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior performance across multiple CD-FSS benchmarks.

  The need for accurate and non-intrusive flow measurement methods has led to the widespread adoption of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), a powerful diagnostic tool in fluid motion estimation. This study investigates the tremendous potential of spike cameras (a type of ultra-high-speed, high-dynamic-range camera) in PIV. We propose a deep learning framework, Spike Imaging Velocimetry (SIV), designed specifically for highly turbulent and intricate flow fields. To aggregate motion features from the spike stream while minimizing information loss, we incorporate a Detail-Preserving Hierarchical Transform (DPHT) module. Additionally, we introduce a Graph Encoder (GE) to extract contextual features from highly complex fluid flows. Furthermore, we present a spike-based PIV dataset, Particle Scenes with Spike and Displacement (PSSD), which provides labeled data for three challenging fluid dynamics scenarios. Our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing baseline methods on PSSD. The datasets and our implementation of SIV are open-sourced in the supplementary materials.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Table structure recognition aims to parse tables in unstructured data into machine-understandable formats. Recent methods address this problem through a two-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods either require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more time-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing algorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance cross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called TableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and logical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and implicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a synergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific decoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and faster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can effectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present DyMU, an efficient, training-free framework that dynamically reduces the computational burden of vision-language models (VLMs) while maintaining high task performance. Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Next-token prediction is the fundamental principle for training large language models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning (RL) further enhances their reasoning performance. As an effective way to model language, image, video, and other modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured visual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It requires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship triplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we introduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using reinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an end-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm, while RL requires the design of effective reward signals. We design a set of graph-centric rewards, including three recall-based variants -- Hard Recall, Hard Recall+Relax, and Soft Recall -- which evaluate semantic and spatial alignment between predictions and ground truth at the object and relation levels. A format consistency reward further ensures that outputs follow the expected structural schema. Extensive experiments on the VG150 and PSG benchmarks show that R1-SGG substantially reduces failure rates and achieves strong performance in Recall and mean Recall, surpassing traditional SGG models and existing multimodal language models.

  High-level 3D scene understanding is essential in many applications. However, the challenges of generating accurate 3D annotations make development of deep learning models difficult. We turn to recent advancements in automatic retrieval of synthetic CAD models, and show that data generated by such methods can be used as high-quality ground truth for training supervised deep learning models. More exactly, we employ a pipeline akin to the one previously used to automatically annotate objects in ScanNet scenes with their 9D poses and CAD models. This time, we apply it to the recent ScanNet++ v1 dataset, which previously lacked such annotations. Our findings demonstrate that it is not only possible to train deep learning models on these automatically-obtained annotations but that the resulting models outperform those trained on manually annotated data. We validate this on two distinct tasks: point cloud completion and single-view CAD model retrieval and alignment. Our results underscore the potential of automatic 3D annotations to enhance model performance while significantly reducing annotation costs. To support future research in 3D scene understanding, we will release our annotations, which we call SCANnotate++, along with our trained models.

  The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.

  Movie Audio Description (AD) aims to narrate visual content during dialogue-free segments, particularly benefiting blind and visually impaired (BVI) audiences. Compared with general video captioning, AD demands plot-relevant narration with explicit character name references, posing unique challenges in moviethis http URLidentify active main characters and focus on storyline-relevant regions, we propose FocusedAD, a novel framework that delivers character-centric movie audio descriptions. It includes: (i) a Character Perception Module(CPM) for tracking character regions and linking them to names; (ii) a Dynamic Prior Module(DPM) that injects contextual cues from prior ADs and subtitles via learnable soft prompts; and (iii) a Focused Caption Module(FCM) that generates narrations enriched with plot-relevant details and named characters. To overcome limitations in character identification, we also introduce an automated pipeline for building character query banks. FocusedAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including strong zero-shot results on MAD-eval-Named and our newly proposed Cinepile-AD dataset.

  Neural representations for video (NeRV) have gained considerable attention for their strong performance across various video tasks. However, existing NeRV methods often struggle to capture fine spatial details, resulting in vague reconstructions. In this paper, we present a Frequency Separation and Augmentation based Neural Representation for video (FANeRV), which addresses these limitations with its core Wavelet Frequency Upgrade Block. This block explicitly separates input frames into high and low-frequency components using discrete wavelet transform, followed by targeted enhancement using specialized modules. Finally, a specially designed gated network effectively fuses these frequency components for optimal reconstruction. Additionally, convolutional residual enhancement blocks are integrated into the later stages of the network to balance parameter distribution and improve the restoration of high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FANeRV significantly improves reconstruction performance and excels in multiple tasks, including video compression, inpainting, and interpolation, outperforming existing NeRV methods.

  Typographic attacks exploit the interplay between text and visual content in multimodal foundation models, causing misclassifications when misleading text is embedded within images. However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthetic attacks closely resemble real-world (handwritten) attacks, validating their use in research. Our work provides a comprehensive resource and empirical insights to facilitate future research toward robust and trustworthy multimodal AI systems. We publicly release the datasets introduced in this paper along with the code for evaluations atthis http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the role of explicit thinking process in rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for MLLMs. We first propose CLS-RL for MLLM image classification, using verifiable rewards for fine-tuning. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.

  Facial Expression Recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in human affective analysis and has been widely applied in computer vision tasks such as human-computer interaction and psychological assessment. The 8th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) Challenge aims to assess human emotions using the video-based Aff-Wild2 dataset. This challenge includes various tasks, including the video-based EXPR recognition track, which is our primary focus. In this paper, we demonstrate that addressing label ambiguity and class imbalance, which are known to cause performance degradation, can lead to meaningful performance improvements. Specifically, we propose Video-based Noise-aware Adaptive Weighting (V-NAW), which adaptively assigns importance to each frame in a clip to address label ambiguity and effectively capture temporal variations in facial expressions. Furthermore, we introduce a simple and effective augmentation strategy to reduce redundancy between consecutive frames, which is a primary cause of overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in video-based FER performance.

  Handling complex or nonlinear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent advances in diffusion-based methods offer improvements over traditional optical flow-based approaches, they still struggle to generate sharp, temporally consistent frames in scenarios with large motion. To address this limitation, we introduce EDEN, an Enhanced Diffusion for high-quality large-motion vidEo frame iNterpolation. Our approach first utilizes a transformer-based tokenizer to produce refined latent representations of the intermediate frames for diffusion models. We then enhance the diffusion transformer with temporal attention across the process and incorporate a start-end frame difference embedding to guide the generation of dynamic motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDEN achieves state-of-the-art results across popular benchmarks, including nearly a 10% LPIPS reduction on DAVIS and SNU-FILM, and an 8% improvement on DAIN-HD.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision-language tasks but their remote sensing (RS) counterpart are relatively under explored. Unlike natural images, RS imagery presents unique challenges that current MLLMs struggle to handle, particularly in visual grounding and spatial reasoning. This study investigates the limitations of CLIP-based MLLMs in RS, highlighting their failure to differentiate visually distinct yet semantically similar RS images. To address this, we introduce a remote sensing multimodal visual patterns (RSMMVP) benchmark. It is designed to evaluate MLLMs in RS tasks by identifying the CLIP-blind pairs, where CLIP-based models incorrectly assign high similarity scores to visually distinct RS images. Through a visual question answering (VQA) evaluation, we analyze the performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing significant limitations in RS specific representation learning. The results provide valuable insights into the weaknesses of CLIP-based visual encoding and offer a foundation for future research to develop more effective MLLMs tailored for remote sensing applications.

  _Qiang Qi, Xiao Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video object detection has made significant progress in recent years thanks to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). Typically, CNNs excel at capturing local features but struggle to model global representations. Conversely, ViTs are adept at capturing long-range global features but face challenges in representing local feature details. Off-the-shelf video object detection methods solely rely on CNNs or ViTs to conduct feature aggregation, which hampers their capability to simultaneously leverage global and local information, thereby resulting in limited detection performance. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-GraphFormer Blender Network (TGBFormer) for video object detection, with three key technical improvements to fully exploit the advantages of transformers and graph convolutional networks while compensating for their limitations. First, we develop a spatial-temporal transformer module to aggregate global contextual information, constituting global representations with long-range feature dependencies. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal GraphFormer module that utilizes local spatial and temporal relationships to aggregate features, generating new local representations that are complementary to the transformer outputs. Third, we design a global-local feature blender module to adaptively couple transformer-based global representations and GraphFormer-based local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TGBFormer establishes new state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet VID dataset. Particularly, our TGBFormer achieves 86.5% mAP while running at around 41.0 FPS on a single Tesla A100 GPU.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in motion diffusion models have led to remarkable progress in diverse motion generation tasks, including text-to-motion synthesis. However, existing approaches represent motions as dense frame sequences, requiring the model to process redundant or less informative frames. The processing of dense animation frames imposes significant training complexity, especially when learning intricate distributions of large motion datasets even with modern neural architectures. This severely limits the performance of generative motion models for downstream tasks. Inspired by professional animators who mainly focus on sparse keyframes, we propose a novel diffusion framework explicitly designed around sparse and geometrically meaningful keyframes. Our method reduces computation by masking non-keyframes and efficiently interpolating missing frames. We dynamically refine the keyframe mask during inference to prioritize informative frames in later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in text alignment and motion realism, while also effectively maintaining high performance at significantly fewer diffusion steps. We further validate the robustness of our framework by using it as a generative prior and adapting it to different downstream tasks.

  _Yi Zhang, Ruonan Lin, Ang Ping_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes a lightweight method for building image super-resolution using a Dilated Contextual Feature Modulation Network (DCFMN). The process includes obtaining high-resolution images, down-sampling them to low-resolution, enhancing the low-resolution images, constructing and training a lightweight network model, and generating super-resolution outputs. To address challenges such as regular textures and long-range dependencies in building images, the DCFMN integrates an expansion separable modulation unit and a local feature enhancement module. The former employs multiple expansion convolutions equivalent to a large kernel to efficiently aggregate multi-scale features while leveraging a simple attention mechanism for adaptivity. The latter encodes local features, mixes channel information, and ensures no additional computational burden during inference through reparameterization. This approach effectively resolves the limitations of existing lightweight super-resolution networks in modeling long-range dependencies, achieving accurate and efficient global feature modeling without increasing computational costs, and significantly improving both reconstruction quality and lightweight efficiency for building image super-resolution models.

  A method for particle orientation tracking is developed and demonstrated specifically for anisotropic particles. Using (high-speed) multi-camera recordings of anisotropic particles from different viewpoints, we reconstruct the 3D location and orientation of these particles using their known shape. This paper describes an algorithm which tracks the location and orientation of multiple anisotropic particles over time, enabling detailed investigations of location, orientation, and rotation statistics. The robustness and error of this method is quantified, and we explore the effects of noise, image size, the number of used cameras, and the camera arrangement by applying the algorithm to synthetic images. We showcase several use-cases of this method in several experiments (in both quiescent and turbulent fluids), demonstrating the effectiveness and broad applicability of the described tracking method. The proposed method is shown to work for widely different particle shapes, successfully tracks multiple particles simultaneously, and the method can distinguish between different types of particles.

  Humans are undoubtedly the most important participants in computer vision, and the ability to detect any individual given a natural language description, a task we define as referring to any person, holds substantial practical value. However, we find that existing models generally fail to achieve real-world usability, and current benchmarks are limited by their focus on one-to-one referring, that hinder progress in this area. In this work, we revisit this task from three critical perspectives: task definition, dataset design, and model architecture. We first identify five aspects of referable entities and three distinctive characteristics of this task. Next, we introduce HumanRef, a novel dataset designed to tackle these challenges and better reflect real-world applications. From a model design perspective, we integrate a multimodal large language model with an object detection framework, constructing a robust referring model named RexSeek. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art models, which perform well on commonly used benchmarks like RefCOCO/+/g, struggle with HumanRef due to their inability to detect multiple individuals. In contrast, RexSeek not only excels in human referring but also generalizes effectively to common object referring, making it broadly applicable across various perception tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has demonstrated superior geometry reconstruction quality than the popular 3DGS by using 2D surfels to approximate thin surfaces. However, it falls short when dealing with glossy surfaces, resulting in visible holes in these areas. We found the reflection discontinuity causes the issue. To fit the jump from diffuse to specular reflection at different viewing angles, depth bias is introduced in the optimized Gaussian primitives. To address that, we first replace the depth distortion loss in 2DGS with a novel depth convergence loss, which imposes a strong constraint on depth continuity. Then, we rectified the depth criterion in determining the actual surface, which fully accounts for all the intersecting Gaussians along the ray. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations across various datasets reveal that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality, with more complete and accurate surfaces than 2DGS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Self-Adaptive Gamma Context-Aware SSM-based model(GCM-DET). This advanced detection framework integrating a Dynamic Gamma Correction (GC) module to enhance grayscale representation and optimize feature extraction for precise defect reconstruction. A State-Space Search Management (SSM) architecture captures robust multi-scale features, effectively handling defects of varying shapes and scales. Focal Loss is employed to mitigate class imbalance and refine detection accuracy. Additionally, the CD5-DET dataset is introduced, specifically designed for port container maintenance, featuring significant grayscale variations and intricate defect patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements, with mAP@0.5 gains of 27.6\%, 6.6\%, and 2.6\% on the CD5-DET, NEU-DET, and GC10-DET datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and autoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective, which minimizes the forward KL divergence, inherently suffers from a mode-covering tendency that limits the generation quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as a unified framework that integrates likelihood-based generative training and GAN-type discrimination to bypass this fundamental constraint by exploiting reverse KL and self-generated negative signals. Our key insight is to parameterize a discriminator implicitly using the likelihood ratio between a learnable target model and a fixed reference model, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint training of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct, efficient, and effective finetuning of a well-trained model to its full potential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in a self-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring less than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion model EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58/1.96 to new records of 1.30/0.97/1.26 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64/ImageNet 512x512 datasets without any guidance mechanisms, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and CFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256x256.

  Compared to width-wise pruning, depth-wise pruning can significantly accelerate inference in resource-constrained scenarios. However, treating the entire Transformer layer as the minimum pruning unit may degrade model performance by indiscriminately discarding the entire information of the layer. This paper reveals the ``Patch-like'' feature relationship between layers in large language models by analyzing the correlation of the outputs of different layers in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Building on this observation, we propose a sliding layer merging method that dynamically selects and fuses consecutive layers from top to bottom according to a pre-defined similarity threshold, thereby simplifying the model structure while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments on LLMs with various architectures and different parameter scales show that our method outperforms existing pruning techniques in both zero-shot inference performance and retraining recovery quality after pruning. In particular, in the experiment with 35% pruning on the Vicuna-7B model, our method achieved a 1.654% improvement in average performance on zero-shot tasks compared to the existing method. Moreover, we further reveal the potential of combining depth pruning with width pruning to enhance the pruning effect. Our codes are available atthis https URL.

  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potent diagnostic tool for detecting pathological tissues in various diseases. Different MRI sequences have different contrast mechanisms and sensitivities for different types of lesions, which pose challenges to accurate and consistent lesion segmentation. In clinical practice, radiologists commonly use the sub-sequence feature, i.e. the difference between post contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (post) and pre-contrast-enhanced (pre) sequences, to locate lesions. Inspired by this, we propose a residual fusion method to learn subsequence representation for MRI lesion segmentation. Specifically, we iteratively and adaptively fuse features from pre- and post-contrast sequences at multiple resolutions, using dynamic weights to achieve optimal fusion and address diverse lesion enhancement patterns. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation and our in-house breast MRI dataset for breast lesion segmentation. Our method is clinically inspired and has the potential to facilitate lesion segmentation in various applications.

  Vision language models (VLM) demonstrate sophisticated multimodal reasoning yet are prone to hallucination when confronted with knowledge conflicts, impeding their deployment in information-sensitive contexts. While existing research addresses robustness in unimodal models, the multimodal domain lacks systematic investigation of cross-modal knowledge conflicts. This research introduces \segsub, a framework for applying targeted image perturbations to investigate VLM resilience against knowledge conflicts. Our analysis reveals distinct vulnerability patterns: while VLMs are robust to parametric conflicts (20% adherence rates), they exhibit significant weaknesses in identifying counterfactual conditions (<30% accuracy) and resolving source conflicts (<1% accuracy). Correlations between contextual richness and hallucination rate (r = -0.368, p = 0.003) reveal the kinds of images that are likely to cause hallucinations. Through targeted fine-tuning on our benchmark dataset, we demonstrate improvements in VLM knowledge conflict detection, establishing a foundation for developing hallucination-resilient multimodal systems in information-sensitive environments.

  Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.

  3D articulated objects modeling has long been a challenging problem, since it requires to capture both accurate surface geometries and semantically meaningful and spatially precise structures, parts, and joints. Existing methods heavily depend on training data from a limited set of handcrafted articulated object categories (e.g., cabinets and drawers), which restricts their ability to model a wide range of articulated objects in an open-vocabulary context. To address these limitations, we propose Articulate Anymesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that Articulate Anymesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects, including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets. Additionally, we show that these generated assets can facilitate the acquisition of new articulated object manipulation skills in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real robotic system.

  3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient photorealistic novel view synthesis method. However, its reliance on sparse Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point clouds often limits scene reconstruction quality. To address the limitation, this paper proposes a novel 3D reconstruction framework, Gaussian Processes enhanced Gaussian Splatting (GP-GS), in which a multi-output Gaussian Process model is developed to enable adaptive and uncertainty-guided densification of sparse SfM point clouds. Specifically, we propose a dynamic sampling and filtering pipeline that adaptively expands the SfM point clouds by leveraging GP-based predictions to infer new candidate points from the input 2D pixels and depth maps. The pipeline utilizes uncertainty estimates to guide the pruning of high-variance predictions, ensuring geometric consistency and enabling the generation of dense point clouds. These densified point clouds provide high-quality initial 3D Gaussians, enhancing reconstruction performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.

  In this work, we investigate four different fusion methods for associating detections to tracklets in multi-object visual tracking. In addition to considering strong cues such as motion and appearance information, we also consider weak cues such as height intersection-over-union (height-IoU) and tracklet confidence information in the data association using different fusion methods. These fusion methods include minimum, weighted sum based on IoU, Kalman filter (KF) gating, and hadamard product of costs due to the different cues. We conduct extensive evaluations on validation sets of MOT17, MOT20 and DanceTrack datasets, and find out that the choice of a fusion method is key for data association in multi-object visual tracking. We hope that this investigative work helps the computer vision research community to use the right fusion method for data association in multi-object visual tracking.

  _Shu Shen, C.L.Philip Chen, Tong Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in many scenarios, but its reliability is undermined by varying sample quality. This paper finds that existing reliable multimodal classification methods not only fail to provide robust estimation of data quality, but also lack dynamic networks for sample-specific depth and parameters to achieve reliable inference. To this end, a novel framework for multimodal reliable classification termed \textit{Multi-level Quality-Adaptive Dynamic multimodal network} (Multi-QuAD) is proposed. Multi-QuAD first adopts a novel approach based on noise-free prototypes and a classifier-free design to reliably estimate the quality of each sample at both modality and feature levels. It then achieves sample-specific network depth via the \textbf{\textit{Global Confidence Normalized Depth (GCND)}} mechanism. By normalizing depth across modalities and samples, \textit{\textbf{GCND}} effectively mitigates the impact of challenging modality inputs on dynamic depth reliability. Furthermore, Multi-QuAD provides sample-adaptive network parameters via the \textbf{\textit{Layer-wise Greedy Parameter (LGP)}} mechanism driven by feature-level quality. The cross-modality layer-wise greedy strategy in \textbf{\textit{LGP}} designs a reliable parameter prediction paradigm for multimodal networks with variable architecture for the first time. Experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that Multi-QuAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification performance and reliability, exhibiting strong adaptability to data with diverse quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.

  _Qizhe Zhang, Aosong Cheng, Ming Lu, Renrui Zhang, Zhiyong Zhuo, Jiajun Cao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) generally contain significantly more visual tokens than their textual counterparts, resulting in a considerable computational burden. Recent efforts have been made to tackle this issue by pruning visual tokens early within the language model. Most existing works use attention scores between text and visual tokens to assess the importance of visual tokens. However, in this study, we first analyze the text-visual attention in the language model and find that this score is not an ideal indicator for token pruning. Based on the analysis, We propose VisPruner, a plug-and-play method that utilizes visual cues for more effective token pruning in LVLMs. Specifically, we first use visual attention to select a limited number of significant tokens. Then, we remove duplicate tokens from the remaining ones based on their similarity. By retaining diverse tokens alongside the initially selected important tokens, we maximally preserve the visual information of the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our VisPruner sustains strong performance across various VLM architectures and reduction ratios, significantly outperforming existing methods based on text-visual attention. Notably, without any training, VisPruner can reduce the FLOPs of LLaVA-1.5-7B by 91% and inference latency by 75%, while maintaining comparable performance. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we are interested in achieving both high text controllability and whole-body appearance consistency in the generation of personalized human characters. We propose a novel framework, named SerialGen, which is a serial generation method consisting of two stages: first, a standardization stage that standardizes reference images, and then a personalized generation stage based on the standardized reference. Furthermore, we introduce two modules aimed at enhancing the standardization process. Our experimental results validate the proposed framework's ability to produce personalized images that faithfully recover the reference image's whole-body appearance while accurately responding to a wide range of text prompts. Through thorough analysis, we highlight the critical contribution of the proposed serial generation method and standardization model, evidencing enhancements in appearance consistency between reference and output images and across serial outputs generated from diverse text prompts. The term "Serial" in this work carries a double meaning: it refers to the two-stage method and also underlines our ability to generate serial images with consistent appearance throughout.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Harnessing low-light enhancement and domain adaptation, nighttime UAV tracking has made substantial strides. However, over-reliance on image enhancement, limited high-quality nighttime data, and a lack of integration between daytime and nighttime trackers hinder the development of an end-to-end trainable framework. Additionally, current ViT-based trackers demand heavy computational resources due to their reliance on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel pure Mamba-based tracking framework (MambaNUT) that employs a state space model with linear complexity as its backbone, incorporating a single-stream architecture that integrates feature learning and template-search coupling within Vision Mamba. We introduce an adaptive curriculum learning (ACL) approach that dynamically adjusts sampling strategies and loss weights, thereby improving the model's ability of generalization. Our ACL is composed of two levels of curriculum schedulers: (1) sampling scheduler that transforms the data distribution from imbalanced to balanced, as well as from easier (daytime) to harder (nighttime) samples; (2) loss scheduler that dynamically assigns weights based on the size of the training set and IoU of individual instances. Exhaustive experiments on multiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MambaNUT achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring lower computational costs. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We explore whether pre-training on datasets with paintings is necessary for a model to learn an artistic style with only a few examples. To investigate this, we train a text-to-image model exclusively on photographs, without access to any painting-related content. We show that it is possible to adapt a model that is trained without paintings to an artistic style, given only few examples. User studies and automatic evaluations confirm that our model (post-adaptation) performs on par with state-of-the-art models trained on massive datasets that contain artistic content like paintings, drawings or illustrations. Finally, using data attribution techniques, we analyze how both artistic and non-artistic datasets contribute to generating artistic-style images. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that high-quality artistic outputs can be achieved without prior exposure to artistic data, indicating that artistic style generation can occur in a controlled, opt-in manner using only a limited, carefully selected set of training examples.

  _Nitish Shukla, Arun Ross_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A facial morph is an image created by combining two face images pertaining to two distinct identities. Face demorphing inverts the process and tries to recover the original images constituting a facial morph. While morph attack detection (MAD) techniques can be used to flag morph images, they do not divulge any visual information about the faces used to create them. Demorphing helps address this problem. Existing demorphing techniques are either very restrictive (assume identities during testing) or produce feeble outputs (both outputs look very similar). In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing dc-GAN, a novel GAN-based demorphing method conditioned on the morph images. Our method overcomes morph-replication and produces high quality reconstructions of the bonafide images used to create the morphs. Moreover, our method is highly generalizable across demorphing paradigms (differential/reference-free). We conduct experiments on AMSL, FRLL-Morphs and MorDiff datasets to showcase the efficacy of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing (RS) visual grounding aims to use natural language expression to locate specific objects (in the form of the bounding box or segmentation mask) in RS images, enhancing human interaction with intelligent RS interpretation systems. Early research in this area was primarily based on horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), but as more diverse RS datasets have become available, tasks involving oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and segmentation masks have emerged. In practical applications, different targets require different grounding types: HBB can localize an object's position, OBB provides its orientation, and mask depicts its shape. However, existing specialized methods are typically tailored to a single type of RS visual grounding task and are hard to generalize across tasks. In contrast, large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit powerful multi-task learning capabilities but struggle to handle dense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper proposes GeoGround, a novel framework that unifies support for HBB, OBB, and mask RS visual grounding tasks, allowing flexible output selection. Rather than customizing the architecture of VLM, our work aims to elegantly support pixel-level visual grounding output through the Text-Mask technique. We define prompt-assisted and geometry-guided learning to enhance consistency across different signals. Experimental results show that GeoGround demonstrates strong performance across four RS visual grounding tasks, matching the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) patrol inspection has emerged as a predominant approach in transmission line monitoring owing to its cost-effectiveness. Detecting defects in transmission lines is a critical task during UAV patrol inspection. However, due to imaging distance and shooting angles, UAV patrol images often suffer from insufficient defect-related visual information, which has an adverse effect on detection accuracy. In this article, we propose a novel method for detecting defects in UAV patrol images, which is based on vision-language pretraining for transmission line (VLP-TL) and a progressive transfer strategy (PTS). Specifically, VLP-TL contains two novel pretraining tasks tailored for the transmission line scenario, aimimg at pretraining an image encoder with abundant knowledge acquired from both visual and linguistic information. Transferring the pretrained image encoder to the defect detector as its backbone can effectively alleviate the insufficient visual information problem. In addition, the PTS further improves transfer performance by progressively bridging the gap between pretraining and downstream defection detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves defect detection accuracy by jointly utilizing multimodal information, overcoming the limitations of insufficient defect-related visual information provided by UAV patrol images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive point cloud sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of point cloud sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of point cloud sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves several 3D perception baseline methods.

  Many industrial and service sectors require tools to extract vehicle characteristics from images. This is a complex task not only by the variety of noise, and large number of classes, but also by the constant introduction of new vehicle models to the market. In this paper, we present Veri-Car, an information retrieval integrated approach designed to help on this task. It leverages supervised learning techniques to accurately identify the make, type, model, year, color, and license plate of cars. The approach also addresses the challenge of handling open-world problems, where new car models and variations frequently emerge, by employing a sophisticated combination of pre-trained models, and a hierarchical multi-similarity loss. Veri-Car demonstrates robust performance, achieving high precision and accuracy in classifying both seen and unseen data. Additionally, it integrates an ensemble license plate detection, and an OCR model to extract license plate numbers with impressive accuracy.

  Camera calibration is fundamental to 3D vision, and the choice of calibration pattern greatly affects the accuracy. To address aberration issue, star-shaped pattern has been proposed as alternatives to traditional checkerboard. However, such pattern suffers from aliasing artifacts. In this paper, we present a novel solution by employing a series of checkerboard patterns rotated around a central point instead of a single star-shaped pattern. We further propose a complete feature extraction algorithm tailored for this design. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach offers improved accuracy over the conventional star-shaped pattern and achieves high stability across varying exposure levels.

  Inspired by the recent success of LLMs, the field of human motion understanding has increasingly shifted toward developing large motion models. Despite some progress, current efforts remain far from achieving truly generalist models, primarily due to the lack of massive high-quality data. To address this gap, we present MotionLib, the first million-level dataset for motion generation, which is at least 15$\times$ larger than existing counterparts and enriched with hierarchical text descriptions. Using MotionLib, we train a large motion model named Being-M0, demonstrating robust performance across a wide range of human activities, including unseen ones. Through systematic investigation, for the first time, we highlight the importance of scaling both data and model size for advancing motion generation, along with key insights to achieve this goal. To better integrate the motion modality, we propose Motionbook, an innovative motion encoding approach including (1) a compact yet lossless feature to represent motions; (2) a novel 2D lookup-free motion tokenizer that preserves fine-grained motion details while expanding codebook capacity, significantly enhancing the representational power of motion tokens. We believe this work lays the groundwork for developing more versatile and powerful motion generation models in the future. For further details, visitthis https URL.

  Understanding and predicting pedestrian crossing behavioral intention is crucial for the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. Nonetheless, challenges emerge when using promising images or environmental context masks to extract various factors for time-series network modeling, causing pre-processing errors or a loss of efficiency. Typically, pedestrian positions captured by onboard cameras are often distorted and do not accurately reflect their actual movements. To address these issues, GTransPDM -- a Graph-embedded Transformer with a Position Decoupling Module -- was developed for pedestrian crossing intention prediction by leveraging multi-modal features. First, a positional decoupling module was proposed to decompose pedestrian lateral motion and encode depth cues in the image view. Then, a graph-embedded Transformer was designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of human pose skeletons, integrating essential factors such as position, skeleton, and ego-vehicle motion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 92% accuracy on the PIE dataset and 87% accuracy on the JAAD dataset, with a processing speed of 0.05ms. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in comparison.

  This study investigates the application and performance of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) in the challenging task of video camouflaged object segmentation (VCOS). VCOS involves detecting objects that blend seamlessly in the surroundings for videos, due to similar colors and textures, poor light conditions, etc. Compared to the objects in normal scenes, camouflaged objects are much more difficult to detect. SAM2, a video foundation model, has shown potential in various tasks. But its effectiveness in dynamic camouflaged scenarios remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive study on SAM2's ability in VCOS. First, we assess SAM2's performance on camouflaged video datasets using different models and prompts (click, box, and mask). Second, we explore the integration of SAM2 with existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and VCOS methods. Third, we specifically adapt SAM2 by fine-tuning it on the video camouflaged dataset. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAM2 has excellent zero-shot ability of detecting camouflaged objects in videos. We also show that this ability could be further improved by specifically adjusting SAM2's parameters for VCOS. The code is available atthis https URL

  The influence of textures on machine learning models has been an ongoing investigation, specifically in texture bias/learning, interpretability, and robustness. However, due to the lack of large and diverse texture data available, the findings in these works have been limited, as more comprehensive evaluations have not been feasible. Image generative models are able to provide data creation at scale, but utilizing these models for texture synthesis has been unexplored and poses additional challenges both in creating accurate texture images and validating those images. In this work, we introduce an extensible methodology and corresponding new dataset for generating high-quality, diverse texture images capable of supporting a broad set of texture-based tasks. Our pipeline consists of: (1) developing prompts from a range of descriptors to serve as input to text-to-image models, (2) adopting and adapting Stable Diffusion pipelines to generate and filter the corresponding images, and (3) further filtering down to the highest quality images. Through this, we create the Prompted Textures Dataset (PTD), a dataset of 246,285 texture images that span 56 textures. During the process of generating images, we find that NSFW safety filters in image generation pipelines are highly sensitive to texture (and flag up to 60\% of our texture images), uncovering a potential bias in these models and presenting unique challenges when working with texture data. Through both standard metrics and a human evaluation, we find that our dataset is high quality and diverse. Our dataset is available for download atthis https URL.

  Data augmentation is crucial for pixel-wise annotation tasks like semantic segmentation, where labeling requires significant effort and intensive labor. Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using \textit{Class-Prompt Appending} and \textit{Visual Prior Blending} to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a \textit{class balancing algorithm} to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stereo matching is a core component in many computer vision and robotics systems. Despite significant advances over the last decade, handling matching ambiguities in ill-posed regions and large disparities remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a new deep network architecture, called IGEV++, for stereo matching. The proposed IGEV++ constructs Multi-range Geometry Encoding Volumes (MGEV), which encode coarse-grained geometry information for ill-posed regions and large disparities, while preserving fine-grained geometry information for details and small disparities. To construct MGEV, we introduce an adaptive patch matching module that efficiently and effectively computes matching costs for large disparity ranges and/or ill-posed regions. We further propose a selective geometry feature fusion module to adaptively fuse multi-range and multi-granularity geometry features in MGEV. Then, we input the fused geometry features into ConvGRUs to iteratively update the disparity map. MGEV allows to efficiently handle large disparities and ill-posed regions, such as occlusions and textureless regions, and enjoys rapid convergence during iterations. Our IGEV++ achieves the best performance on the Scene Flow test set across all disparity ranges, up to 768px. Our IGEV++ also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the Middlebury, ETH3D, KITTI 2012, and 2015 benchmarks. Specifically, IGEV++ achieves a 3.23\% 2-pixel outlier rate (Bad 2.0) on the large disparity benchmark, Middlebury, representing error reductions of 31.9\% and 54.8\% compared to RAFT-Stereo and GMStereo, respectively. We also present a real-time version of IGEV++ that achieves the best performance among all published real-time methods on the KITTI benchmarks.

  Crop phenology describes the physiological development stages of crops from planting to harvest which is valuable information for decision makers to plan and adapt agricultural management strategies. In the era of big Earth observation data ubiquity, attempts have been made to accurately detect crop phenology using Remote Sensing (RS) and high resolution weather data. However, most studies have focused on large scale predictions of phenology or developed methods which are not adequate to help crop modeler communities on leveraging Sentinel-1 and Sentinal-2 data and fusing them with high resolution climate data, using a novel framework. For this, we trained a Machine Learning (ML) LightGBM model to predict 13 phenological stages for eight major crops across Germany at 20 m scale. Observed phonologies were taken from German national phenology network (German Meteorological Service; DWD) between 2017 and 2021. We proposed a thorough feature selection analysis to find the best combination of RS and climate data to detect phenological stages. At national scale, predicted phenology resulted in a reasonable precision of R2 > 0.43 and a low Mean Absolute Error of 6 days, averaged over all phenological stages and crops. The spatio-temporal analysis of the model predictions demonstrates its transferability across different spatial and temporal context of Germany. The results indicated that combining radar sensors with climate data yields a very promising performance for a multitude of practical applications. Moreover, these improvements are expected to be useful to generate highly valuable input for crop model calibrations and evaluations, facilitate informed agricultural decisions, and contribute to sustainable food production to address the increasing global food demand.

  Visual tracking has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by the availability of large-scale training datasets that have enabled the development of highly accurate and robust algorithms. While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable atthis https URL.

  _Hanzheng Wang, Wei Li, Xiang-Gen Xia, Qian Du_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral object tracking (HOT) has exhibited potential in various applications, particularly in scenes where objects are camouflaged. Existing trackers can effectively retrieve objects via band regrouping because of the bias in existing HOT datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing visual appearances rather than spectral characteristics. This bias allows the tracker to directly use the visual features obtained from the false-color images generated by hyperspectral images without the need to extract spectral features. To tackle this bias, we find that the tracker should focus on the spectral information when object appearance is unreliable. Thus, we provide a new task called hyperspectral camouflaged object tracking (HCOT) and meticulously construct a large-scale HCOT dataset, termed BihoT, which consists of 41,912 hyperspectral images covering 49 video sequences. The dataset covers various artificial camouflage scenes where objects have similar appearances, diverse spectrums, and frequent occlusion, making it a very challenging dataset for HCOT. Besides, a simple but effective baseline model, named spectral prompt-based distractor-aware network (SPDAN), is proposed, comprising a spectral embedding network (SEN), a spectral prompt-based backbone network (SPBN), and a distractor-aware module (DAM). Specifically, the SEN extracts spectral-spatial features via 3-D and 2-D convolutions. Then, the SPBN fine-tunes powerful RGB trackers with spectral prompts and alleviates the insufficiency of training samples. Moreover, the DAM utilizes a novel statistic to capture the distractor caused by occlusion from objects and background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SPDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed BihoT and other HOT datasets.

  Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging task due to its compositional property. Previous approaches improve prediction efficiency through end-to-end learning. However, these methods exhibit limited performance as they assume unidirectional conditioning between entities and predicates, which restricts effective information interaction. To address this limitation, we propose a novel bidirectional conditioning factorization in a semantic-aligned space for SGG, enabling efficient and generalizable interaction between entities and predicates. Specifically, we introduce an end-to-end scene graph generation model, the Bidirectional Conditioning Transformer (BCTR), to implement this factorization. BCTR consists of two key modules. First, the Bidirectional Conditioning Generator (BCG) performs multi-stage interactive feature augmentation between entities and predicates, enabling mutual enhancement between these predictions. Second, Random Feature Alignment (RFA) is present to regularize feature space by distilling multi-modal knowledge from pre-trained models. Within this regularized feature space, BCG is feasible to capture interaction patterns across diverse relationships during training, and the learned interaction patterns can generalize to unseen but semantically related relationships during inference. Extensive experiments on Visual Genome and Open Image V6 show that BCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) provide a versatile framework for representing a diverse array of 3D shapes, encompassing both watertight and non-watertight geometries. Traditional UDF learning methods typically require extensive training on large 3D shape datasets, which is costly and necessitates re-training for new datasets. This paper presents a novel neural framework, LoSF-UDF, for reconstructing surfaces from 3D point clouds by leveraging local shape functions to learn UDFs. We observe that 3D shapes manifest simple patterns in localized regions, prompting us to develop a training dataset of point cloud patches characterized by mathematical functions that represent a continuum from smooth surfaces to sharp edges and corners. Our approach learns features within a specific radius around each query point and utilizes an attention mechanism to focus on the crucial features for UDF estimation. Despite being highly lightweight, with only 653 KB of trainable parameters and a modest-sized training dataset with 0.5 GB storage, our method enables efficient and robust surface reconstruction from point clouds without requiring for shape-specific training. Furthermore, our method exhibits enhanced resilience to noise and outliers in point clouds compared to existing methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments and comparisons across various datasets, including synthetic and real-scanned point clouds, to validate our method's efficacy. Notably, our lightweight framework offers rapid and reliable initialization for other unsupervised iterative approaches, improving both the efficiency and accuracy of their reconstructions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Edge detection is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Despite the efficiency of existing algorithms, their performance, however, rely heavily on the pre-trained weights of the backbone network on the ImageNet dataset. The use of pre-trained weights in previous methods significantly increases the difficulty to design new models for edge detection without relying on existing well-trained ImageNet models, as pre-training the model on the ImageNet dataset is expensive and becomes compulsory to ensure the fairness of comparison. Besides, the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy is not always useful and sometimes even inaccessible. For instance, the pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset are unlikely to be helpful for edge detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images due to strong differences in the statistics between optical images and SAR images. Moreover, no dataset has comparable size to the ImageNet dataset for SAR image processing. In this work, we study the performance achievable by state-of-the-art deep learning based edge detectors in publicly available datasets when they are trained from scratch, and devise a new network architecture, the multi-stream and multi-scale fusion net (msmsfnet), for edge detection. We show in our experiments that by training all models from scratch, our model outperforms state-of-the-art edge detectors in three publicly available datasets. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our model for edge detection in SAR images, where no useful pre-trained weight is available. Finally, We show that our model is able to achieve competitive performance on the BSDS500 dataset when the pre-trained weights are used.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It has been revealed that small efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including maintaining boundary region completeness and preserving target region connectivity, despite their favorable capacity to recognize main object regions. In this work, we propose a complementary boundary and context distillation (BCD) method within the KD framework for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted knowledge transfer from large accurate teacher models to compact efficient student models. Specifically, the boundary distillation component focuses on extracting explicit object-level semantic boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps of the backbone network to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Concurrently, the context distillation component leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed BCD method is specifically designed for EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on various representative datasets demonstrate that our method can outperform existing methods without requiring extra supervisions or incurring increased inference costs, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.

  Traditional bird classifiers mostly rely on the visual characteristics of birds. Some prior works even train classifiers to be invariant to the background, completely discarding the living environment of birds. Instead, we are the first to explore integrating habitat information, one of the four major cues for identifying birds by ornithologists, into modern bird classifiers. We focus on two leading model types: (1) CNNs and ViTs trained on the downstream bird datasets; and (2) original, multi-modal CLIP. Training CNNs and ViTs with habitat-augmented data results in an improvement of up to +0.83 and +0.23 points on NABirds and CUB-200, respectively. Similarly, adding habitat descriptors to the prompts for CLIP yields a substantial accuracy boost of up to +0.99 and +1.1 points on NABirds and CUB-200, respectively. We find consistent accuracy improvement after integrating habitat features into the image augmentation process and into the textual descriptors of vision-language CLIP classifiers.

  Recovering textures under shadows has remained a challenging problem due to the difficulty of inferring shadow-free scenes from shadow images. In this paper, we propose the use of diffusion models as they offer a promising approach to gradually refine the details of shadow regions during the diffusion process. Our method improves this process by conditioning on a learned latent feature space that inherits the characteristics of shadow-free images, thus avoiding the limitation of conventional methods that condition on degraded images only. Additionally, we propose to alleviate potential local optima during training by fusing noise features with the diffusion network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which outperforms the previous best method by 13% in terms of RMSE on the AISTD dataset. Further, we explore instance-level shadow removal, where our model outperforms the previous best method by 82% in terms of RMSE on the DESOBA dataset.

  Reviewing plays an important role when learning knowledge. The knowledge acquisition at a certain time point may be strongly inspired with the help of previous experience. Thus the knowledge growing procedure should show strong relationship along the temporal dimension. In our research, we find that during the network training, the evolution of feature map follows temporal sequence property. A proper temporal supervision may further improve the network training performance. Inspired by this observation, we propose Temporal Supervised Knowledge Distillation (TSKD). Specifically, we extract the spatiotemporal features in the different training phases of student by convolutional Long Short-term memory network (Conv-LSTM). Then, we train the student net through a dynamic target, rather than static teacher network features. This process realizes the refinement of old knowledge in student network, and utilizes it to assist current learning. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and advantages of our method over existing knowledge distillation methods, including various network architectures and different tasks (image classification and object detection) .

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features, which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.

  A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%, RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require cross-context relations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Currently, the scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces challenges and bottlenecks. This paper posits that noise effects, stemming from changes in the signal-to-noise ratio under diminishing marginal returns, are the root cause of these issues. To control this noise, we investigated the differences between models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the concept of "relative overfitting." Based on their complementary strengths, we have proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR). In Natural Language Processing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium for discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive influence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected negative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on mainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple datasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject examination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate that through our structure, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can achieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and computational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal, stable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of "relative overfitting" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as computer vision (CV) and AI for science. We hope the proposed approach can help scale laws overcome existing bottlenecks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically reinforcement learning, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM) agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse, open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning, and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation towards next-generation MLE agents.

  Algorithm selection, aiming to identify the best algorithm for a given problem, plays a pivotal role in continuous black-box optimization. A common approach involves representing optimization functions using a set of features, which are then used to train a machine learning meta-model for selecting suitable algorithms. Various approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of these algorithm selection meta-models. However, not all evaluation approaches are equally valid for assessing the performance of meta-models. We highlight methodological issues that frequently occur in the community and should be addressed when evaluating algorithm selection approaches. First, we identify flaws with the "leave-instance-out" evaluation technique. We show that non-informative features and meta-models can achieve high accuracy, which should not be the case with a well-designed evaluation framework. Second, we demonstrate that measuring the performance of optimization algorithms with metrics sensitive to the scale of the objective function requires careful consideration of how this impacts the construction of the meta-model, its predictions, and the model's error. Such metrics can falsely present overly optimistic performance assessments of the meta-models. This paper emphasizes the importance of careful evaluation, as loosely defined methodologies can mislead researchers, divert efforts, and introduce noise into the field

  Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the ability of reasoning models to directly perform chemistry tasks, without any assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ, which consists of 796 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry, focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world applications. The reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3-mini, correctly answered 28%-59% of questions depending on the reasoning level used, with higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks. These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning model, GPT-4o, which achieved only 7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform. Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures from 1H and 13C NMR data, correctly generating SMILES strings for 74% of molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure comprising 21 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the latest reasoning models have the ability to perform advanced chemical reasoning.

  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.

  Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks by leveraging rich textual information with minimal labeled data. However, deploying such large models remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a well-established solution to this problem; however, recent KD approaches from VLMs often involve multi-stage training or additional tuning, increasing computational overhead and optimization complexity. In this paper, we propose $\mathbf{\texttt{D}}$ual-$\mathbf{\texttt{H}}$ead $\mathbf{\texttt{O}}$ptimization ($\mathbf{\texttt{DHO}}$) -- a simple yet effective KD framework that transfers knowledge from VLMs to compact, task-specific models in semi-supervised settings. Specifically, we introduce dual prediction heads that independently learn from labeled data and teacher predictions, and propose to linearly combine their outputs during inference. We observe that $\texttt{DHO}$ mitigates gradient conflicts between supervised and distillation signals, enabling more effective feature learning than single-head KD baselines. As a result, extensive experiments show that $\texttt{DHO}$ consistently outperforms baselines across multiple domains and fine-grained datasets. Notably, on ImageNet, it achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by 3% and 0.1% with 1% and 10% labeled data, respectively, while using fewer parameters.

  This study focuses on the challenge of predicting network traffic within complex topological environments. It introduces a spatiotemporal modeling approach that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The GCN component captures spatial dependencies among network nodes, while the GRU component models the temporal evolution of traffic data. This combination allows for precise forecasting of future traffic patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through comprehensive experiments on the real-world Abilene network traffic dataset. The model is benchmarked against several popular deep learning methods. Furthermore, a set of ablation experiments is conducted to examine the influence of various components on performance, including changes in the number of graph convolution layers, different temporal modeling strategies, and methods for constructing the adjacency matrix. Results indicate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, demonstrating robust stability and strong generalization capabilities in complex network traffic forecasting scenarios.

  Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), as a simple yet powerful model, continues to be widely used in classification and regression tasks. However, traditional MLPs often struggle to efficiently capture nonlinear relationships in load data when dealing with complex datasets. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, have shown promising capabilities in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. In this study, we explore the performance of KANs within federated learning (FL) frameworks and compare them to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons. Our experiments, conducted across four diverse datasets demonstrate that KANs consistently outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy, stability, and convergence efficiency. KANs exhibit remarkable robustness under varying client numbers and non-IID data distributions, maintaining superior performance even as client heterogeneity increases. Notably, KANs require fewer communication rounds to converge compared to MLPs, highlighting their efficiency in FL scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate multiple parameter aggregation strategies, with trimmed mean and FedProx emerging as the most effective for optimizing KAN performance. These findings establish KANs as a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs for federated learning tasks, paving the way for their application in decentralized and privacy-preserving environments.

  One of the defining challenges in federated learning is that of statistical heterogeneity among clients. We address this problem with KARULA, a regularized strategy for personalized federated learning, which constrains the pairwise model dissimilarities between clients based on the difference in their distributions, as measured by a surrogate for the 1-Wasserstein distance adapted for the federated setting. This allows the strategy to adapt to highly complex interrelations between clients, that e.g., clustered approaches fail to capture. We propose an inexact projected stochastic gradient algorithm to solve the constrained problem that the strategy defines, and show theoretically that it converges with smooth, possibly non-convex losses to a neighborhood of a stationary point with rate O(1/K). We demonstrate the effectiveness of KARULA on synthetic and real federated data sets.

  Pseudo-labeling is a cornerstone of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), yet the scarcity of High-Confidence Pseudo-Labeled Target Domain Samples (\textbf{hcpl-tds}) often leads to inaccurate cross-domain statistical alignment, causing DA failures. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{N}oise \textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion for \textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly integrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the decision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for efficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA classifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified optimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain samples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{I}) \) initialization in diffusion models often generates class-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we introduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling regions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments across 5 benchmark datasets and 29 DA tasks demonstrate significant performance gains of \textbf{NOCDDA} over 31 state-of-the-art methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness.

  Reward baseline is important for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is proposed to compute the advantage for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all outputs in the group. However, it can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates in environments with highly noisy rewards, potentially introducing bias. In this work, we propose a model, called Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (KRPO), by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically estimate the latent reward mean and variance. This filtering technique replaces the naive batch mean baseline, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization. Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models. Through experiments and analyses, we show that using a more adaptive advantage estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) has become an effective and widely used approach to training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL) methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling specific to each client's unique characteristics. In this work, the efficacy of theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures within the Ditto framework, a state-of-the-art technique in pFL, are investigated. The use of such measures significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. While the Ditto algorithm is specifically considered, such measures are directly applicable to a number of other pFL settings, and the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.

  _Jing Ren, Mingliang Hou, Zhixuan Liu, Xiaomei Bai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph anomaly detection is a popular and vital task in various real-world scenarios, which has been studied for several decades. Recently, many studies extending deep learning-based methods have shown preferable performance on graph anomaly detection. However, existing methods are lack of efficiency that is definitely necessary for embedded devices. Towards this end, we propose an Efficient Anomaly detection model on heterogeneous Graphs via contrastive LEarning (EAGLE) by contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of their distances to the local context. The proposed method first samples instance pairs on meta path-level for contrastive learning. Then, a graph autoencoder-based model is applied to learn informative node embeddings in an unsupervised way, which will be further combined with the discriminator to predict the anomaly scores of nodes. Experimental results show that EAGLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three heterogeneous network datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in modeling large-scale data distributions. However, many downstream tasks require guiding the generated content based on specific differentiable metrics, typically necessitating backpropagation during the generation process. This approach is computationally expensive, as generating with DMs often demands tens to hundreds of recursive network calls, resulting in high memory usage and significant time consumption. In this paper, we propose a more efficient alternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel denoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation process is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining the computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a shortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call Shortcut Diffusion Optimization (SDO), is generic, high-performance, and computationally lightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SDO on several real-world tasks, including controlling generation by optimizing latent and aligning the DMs by fine-tuning network parameters. Compared to full backpropagation, our approach reduces computational costs by $\sim 90\%$ while maintaining superior performance. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks. Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7 % and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing samples or heads.

  _Peng Sun, Yi Jiang, Tao Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000 sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8 steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a 675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps. Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at 250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available at:this https URL.

  _Prateek Garg, Lokesh Nagalapatti, Sunita Sarawagi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Algorithmic Recourse provides recommendations to individuals who are adversely impacted by automated model decisions, on how to alter their profiles to achieve a favorable outcome. Effective recourse methods must balance three conflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost, plausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired outcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately and then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse goals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce GenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse objectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack of direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such supervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent estimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent based search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over the generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior performance across multiple metrics. We also demonstrate GenRe provides the best trade-off between cost, plausibility and validity, compared to state-of-art baselines. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.

  _Pei-Fu Guo, Yun-Da Tsai, Shou-De Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect outputs, known as hallucinations, which undermine their reliability in real-world applications. While uncertainty estimation has emerged as a promising strategy for detecting such errors, current metrics offer limited interpretability and lack clarity about the types of uncertainty they capture. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for decomposing LLM uncertainty into four distinct sources, inspired by previous research. We develop a source-specific estimation pipeline to quantify these uncertainty types and evaluate how existing metrics relate to each source across tasks and models. Our results show that metrics, task, and model exhibit systematic variation in uncertainty characteristic. Building on this, we propose a method for task specific metric/model selection guided by the alignment or divergence between their uncertainty characteristics and that of a given task. Our experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware selection strategy consistently outperforms baseline strategies, helping us select appropriate models or uncertainty metrics, and contributing to more reliable and efficient deployment in uncertainty estimation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating large language models (LLMs) as priors in reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant advantages but comes with substantial computational costs. We present a principled cache-efficient framework for posterior sampling with LLM-derived priors that dramatically reduces these costs while maintaining high performance. At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism, where cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived from policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both discrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control domains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\times$ reduction in LLM queries and 4.0--12.0$\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\,ms on a consumer GPU) while retaining 96--98\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis provides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically. The framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves performance by 14--29\% and reduces training time by 38--40\%. Extensive evaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the generalizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in resource-constrained settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify the MoE designs in attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention mechanism, revealing an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules. Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between FFN and attention components.

  Predicting future vehicle purchases among existing owners presents a critical challenge due to extreme class imbalance (<0.5% positive rate) and complex behavioral patterns. We propose REMEDI (Relative feature Enhanced Meta-learning with Distillation for Imbalanced prediction), a novel multi-stage framework addressing these challenges. REMEDI first trains diverse base models to capture complementary aspects of user behavior. Second, inspired by comparative op-timization techniques, we introduce relative performance meta-features (deviation from ensemble mean, rank among peers) for effective model fusion through a hybrid-expert architecture. Third, we distill the ensemble's knowledge into a single efficient model via supervised fine-tuning with MSE loss, enabling practical deployment. Evaluated on approximately 800,000 vehicle owners, REMEDI significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving the business target of identifying ~50% of actual buyers within the top 60,000 recommendations at ~10% precision. The distilled model preserves the ensemble's predictive power while maintaining deployment efficiency, demonstrating REMEDI's effectiveness for imbalanced prediction in industry settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional machine learning (ML) raises serious privacy concerns, while federated learning (FL) mitigates the risk of data leakage by keeping data on local devices. However, the training process of FL can still leak sensitive information, which adversaries may exploit to infer private data. One of the most prominent threats is the membership inference attack (MIA), where the adversary aims to determine whether a particular data record was part of the training set.This paper addresses this problem through a two-stage defense called AugMixCloak. The core idea is to apply data augmentation and principal component analysis (PCA)-based information fusion to query images, which are detected by perceptual hashing (pHash) as either identical to or highly similar to images in the training set. Experimental results show that AugMixCloak successfully defends against both binary classifier-based MIA and metric-based MIA across five datasets and various decentralized FL (DFL) topologies. Compared with regularization-based defenses, AugMixCloak demonstrates stronger protection. Compared with confidence score masking, AugMixCloak exhibits better generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finite element (FE) modeling is essential for structural analysis but remains computationally intensive, especially under dynamic loading. While operator learning models have shown promise in replicating static structural responses at FEM level accuracy, modeling dynamic behavior remains more challenging. This work presents a Multiple Input Operator Network (MIONet) that incorporates a second trunk network to explicitly encode temporal dynamics, enabling accurate prediction of structural responses under moving loads. Traditional DeepONet architectures using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are limited by fixed time discretization and struggle to capture continuous dynamics. In contrast, MIONet predicts responses continuously over both space and time, removing the need for step wise modeling. It maps scalar inputs including load type, velocity, spatial mesh, and time steps to full field structural responses. To improve efficiency and enforce physical consistency, we introduce a physics informed loss based on dynamic equilibrium using precomputed mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, without solving the governing PDEs directly. Further, a Schur complement formulation reduces the training domain, significantly cutting computational costs while preserving global accuracy. The model is validated on both a simple beam and the KW-51 bridge, achieving FEM level accuracy within seconds. Compared to GRU based DeepONet, our model offers comparable accuracy with improved temporal continuity and over 100 times faster inference, making it well suited for real-time structural monitoring and digital twin applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

  Diabetes remains a significant health challenge globally, contributing to severe complications like kidney disease, vision loss, and heart issues. The application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare enables efficient and accurate disease prediction, offering avenues for early intervention and patient support. Our study introduces an innovative diabetes prediction framework, leveraging both traditional ML techniques such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest and advanced ensemble methods like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and XGBoost. Central to our approach is the development of a novel model, DNet, a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for effective feature extraction and sequential learning. The DNet model comprises an initial convolutional block for capturing essential features, followed by a residual block with skip connections to facilitate efficient information flow. Batch Normalization and Dropout are employed for robust regularization, and an LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the data. Using a Kaggle-sourced real-world diabetes dataset, our model evaluation spans cross-validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Among the models, DNet demonstrates the highest efficacy with an accuracy of 99.79% and an AUC-ROC of 99.98%, establishing its potential for superior diabetes prediction. This robust hybrid architecture showcases the value of combining CNN and LSTM layers, emphasizing its applicability in medical diagnostics and disease prediction tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Post-training quantization is a key technique for reducing the memory and inference latency of large language models by quantizing weights and activations without requiring retraining. However, existing methods either (1) fail to account for the varying importance of hidden features to the end loss or, when incorporating end loss, (2) neglect the critical interactions between model weights. To address these limitations, we propose GuidedQuant, a novel quantization approach that integrates gradient information from the end loss into the quantization objective while preserving cross-weight dependencies within output channels. GuidedQuant consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art quantization methods across weight-only scalar, weight-only vector, and weight-and-activation quantization. Additionally, we introduce a novel non-uniform scalar quantization algorithm, which is guaranteed to monotonically decrease the quantization objective value, and outperforms existing methods in this category. We release the code atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a new perspective for analyzing the generalization power of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., directly disentangling and analyzing the dynamics of generalizable and non-generalizable interaction encoded by a DNN through the training process. Specifically, this work builds upon the recent theoretical achievement in explainble AI, which proves that the detailed inference logic of DNNs can be can be strictly rewritten as a small number of AND-OR interaction patterns. Based on this, we propose an efficient method to quantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a distinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions during training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes noisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable ones. The second and the third phases tend to capture increasingly complex interactions that are harder to generalize. Experimental results verify that the learning of non-generalizable interactions is the the direct cause for the gap between the training and testing losses.

  As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and ``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse electromagnetic modeling has emerged as a powerful approach for designing complex microwave structures with high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for the inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components based on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to demonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure. Therefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart filter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design techniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved generalization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to generate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy inspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network (HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate that the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy compared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical metrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate the proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW structure. Next, we apply the trained IRC-Net model to predict the geometry of a four-resonance structure based on its desired frequency response. Both designs are fabricated and tested, showing strong agreement between the simulated, predicted, and measured results, confirming the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting has important applications in financial analysis, weather forecasting, and traffic management. However, existing deep learning models are limited in processing non-stationary time series data because they cannot effectively capture the statistical characteristics that change over time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new framework, AEFIN, which enhances the information sharing ability between stable and unstable components by introducing a cross-attention mechanism, and combines Fourier analysis networks with MLP to deeply explore the seasonal patterns and trend characteristics in unstable components. In addition, we design a new loss function that combines time-domain stability constraints, time-domain instability constraints, and frequency-domain stability constraints to improve the accuracy and robustness of forecasting. Experimental results show that AEFIN outperforms the most common models in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, especially under non-stationary data conditions, and shows excellent forecasting capabilities. This paper provides an innovative solution for the modeling and forecasting of non-stationary time series data, and contributes to the research of deep learning for complex time series.

  In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

  Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Soft} sparse \textbf{Shape}s (\textbf{SoftShape}) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.

  Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with a modest increase in execution time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) have emerged as promising solutions for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning infinite-dimensional function mappings through frequency domain transformations. However, the sparsity of high-frequency signals limits computational efficiency for high-dimensional inputs, and fixed-pattern truncation often causes high-frequency signal loss, reducing performance in scenarios such as high-resolution inputs or long-term predictions. To address these challenges, we propose FreqMoE, an efficient and progressive training framework that exploits the dependency of high-frequency signals on low-frequency components. The model first learns low-frequency weights and then applies a sparse upward-cycling strategy to construct a mixture of experts (MoE) in the frequency domain, effectively extending the learned weights to high-frequency regions. Experiments on both regular and irregular grid PDEs demonstrate that FreqMoE achieves up to 16.6% accuracy improvement while using merely 2.1% parameters (47.32x reduction) compared to dense FNO. Furthermore, the approach demonstrates remarkable stability in long-term predictions and generalizes seamlessly to various FNO variants and grid structures, establishing a new ``Low frequency Pretraining, High frequency Fine-tuning'' paradigm for solving PDEs.

  _Zihan Guan, Mengxuan Hu, Ronghang Zhu, Sheng Li, Anil Vullikanti_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have uncovered a troubling vulnerability in the fine-tuning stage of large language models (LLMs): even fine-tuning on entirely benign datasets can lead to a significant increase in the harmfulness of LLM outputs. Building on this finding, our red teaming study takes this threat one step further by developing a more effective attack. Specifically, we analyze and identify samples within benign datasets that contribute most to safety degradation, then fine-tune LLMs exclusively on these samples. We approach this problem from an outlier detection perspective and propose Self-Inf-N, to detect and extract outliers for fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning LLMs on 100 outlier samples selected by Self-Inf-N in the benign datasets severely compromises LLM safety alignment. Extensive experiments across seven mainstream LLMs demonstrate that our attack exhibits high transferability across different architectures and remains effective in practical scenarios. Alarmingly, our results indicate that most existing mitigation strategies fail to defend against this attack, underscoring the urgent need for more robust alignment safeguards.

  _Thien Nhan Vo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Illegal parking along with the lack of available parking spaces are among the biggest issues faced in many large cities. These issues can have a significant impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level, equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate parking violation predictions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper quantitatively investigates the crash severity of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with spatially localized machine learning and macroscopic measures of the urban built environment. We address spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation, while focusing on land use patterns and human behavior. Our Geographical Random Forest (GRF) model, accompanied with a crash severity risk map of San Francisco, presents three findings that are useful for commercial operations of AVs and robotaxis. First, spatially localized machine learning performed better than regular machine learning, when predicting AV crash severity. Bias-variance tradeoff was evident as we adjust the localization weight hyperparameter. Second, land use was the most important built environment measure, compared to intersections, building footprints, public transit stops, and Points Of Interests (POIs). Third, it was predicted that city center areas with greater diversity and commercial activities were more likely to result in low-severity AV crashes, than residential neighborhoods. Residential land use may be associated with higher severity due to human behavior and less restrictive environment. This paper recommends to explicitly consider geographic locations, and to design safety measures specific to residential neighborhoods, when robotaxi operators train their AV systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD (Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents, each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation tasks.

  _David Zucker_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous domains, their black-box nature remains a significant limitation, especially in critical fields such as medical image analysis and inference. Existing explainability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, are typically applied post hoc, adding computational overhead and sometimes producing inconsistent or ambiguous results. In this paper, we present the Deeply Explainable Artificial Neural Network (DxANN), a novel deep learning architecture that embeds explainability ante hoc, directly into the training process. Unlike conventional models that require external interpretation methods, DxANN is designed to produce per-sample, per-feature explanations as part of the forward pass. Built on a flow-based framework, it enables both accurate predictions and transparent decision-making, and is particularly well-suited for image-based tasks. While our focus is on medical imaging, the DxANN architecture is readily adaptable to other data modalities, including tabular and sequential data. DxANN marks a step forward toward intrinsically interpretable deep learning, offering a practical solution for applications where trust and accountability are essential.

  _Debashish Saha, Piyush Malik, Adrika Saha_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current studies in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily focus on the classification of activities through sensor data, while there is not much emphasis placed on recognizing the individuals performing these activities. This type of classification is very important for developing personalized and context-sensitive applications. Additionally, the issue of missing sensor data, which often occurs in practical situations due to hardware malfunctions, has not been explored yet. This paper seeks to fill these voids by introducing a lightweight LSTM-based model that can be used to classify both activities and subjects. The proposed model was used to classify the HAR dataset by UCI [1], achieving an accuracy of 93.89% in activity recognition (across six activities), nearing the 96.67% benchmark, and an accuracy of 80.19% in subject recognition (involving 30 subjects), thereby establishing a new baseline for this area of research. We then simulate the absence of sensor data to mirror real-world scenarios and incorporate imputation techniques, both with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to restore incomplete datasets. We found that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation performs the best for filling the missing sensor data without PCA because the use of PCA resulted in slightly lower accuracy. These results demonstrate how well the framework handles missing sensor data, which is a major step forward in using the Human Activity Recognition dataset for reliable classification tasks.

  _Jianxin Zhang, Lianzi Jiang, Xinyu Han, Xiangrong Wang, Weinan Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate prediction of waves behind floating breakwaters (FB) is crucial for optimizing coastal engineering structures, enhancing safety, and improving design efficiency. Existing methods demonstrate limitations in capturing nonlinear interactions between waves and structures, while exhibiting insufficient capability in modeling the complex frequency-domain relationships among elevations of different wave gauges. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Exogenous-to-Endogenous Frequency-Aware Network (E2E-FANet), a novel end-to-end neural network designed to model relationships between waves and structures. The E2E-FANetarchitecture incorporates a Dual-Basis Frequency Mapping (DBFM) module that leverages orthogonal cosine and sine bases to extract wave features from the frequency domain while preserving temporal information. Additionally, we introduce the Exogenous-to-Endogenous Cross-Attention (E2ECA) module, which employs cross attention to model the interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables. We incorporate a Temporal-wise Attention (TA) mechanism that adaptively captures complex dependencies in endogenous variables. These integrated modules function synergistically, enabling E2E-FANet to achieve both comprehensive feature perception in the time-frequency domain and precise modeling of wave-structure interactions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of E2E-FANet, we constructed a multi-level validation framework comprising three distinct testing scenarios: internal validation under identical wave conditions, generalization testing across different wave conditions, and adaptability testing with varying relative water density (RW) conditions. These comprehensive tests demonstrate that E2E-FANet provides accurate waves behind FB predictions while successfully generalizing diverse wave conditions.

  _Jianxin Zhang, Lianzi Jiang, Xinyu Han, Xiangrong Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise forecasting of significant wave height (Hs) is essential for the development and utilization of wave energy. The challenges in predicting Hs arise from its non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. The combination of decomposition preprocessing and machine learning models have demonstrated significant effectiveness in Hs prediction by extracting data features. However, decomposing the unknown data in the test set can lead to data leakage issues. To simultaneously achieve data feature extraction and prevent data leakage, a novel Adaptive Feature Extraction Time-Frequency Network (AFE-TFNet) is proposed to improve prediction accuracy and stability. It is encoder-decoder rolling framework. The encoder consists of two stages: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, global and local frequency domain features are extracted by combining Wavelet Transform (WT) and Fourier Transform (FT), and multi-scale frequency analysis is performed using Inception blocks. In the feature fusion stage, time-domain and frequency-domain features are integrated through dominant harmonic sequence energy weighting (DHSEW). The decoder employed an advanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Hourly measured wind speed (Ws), dominant wave period (DPD), average wave period (APD) and Hs from three stations are used as the dataset, and the four metrics are employed to evaluate the forecasting performance. Results show that AFE-TFNet significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Feature extraction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. DHSEW has substantially increased the accuracy of medium-term to long-term forecasting. The prediction accuracy of AFE-TFNet does not demonstrate significant variability with changes of rolling time window size. Overall, AFE-TFNet shows strong potential for handling complex signal forecasting.

  _Patrick Blumenberg, Thomas Graave, Tim Fingscheidt_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demand extensive memory capacity during both fine-tuning and inference. To enable memory-efficient fine-tuning, existing methods apply block-wise quantization techniques, such as NF4 and AF4, to the network weights. We show that these quantization techniques incur suboptimal quantization errors. Therefore, as a first novelty, we propose an optimization approach for block-wise quantization. Using this method, we design a family of quantizers named 4-bit block-wise optimal float (BOF4), which consistently reduces the quantization error compared to both baseline methods. We provide both a theoretical and a data-driven solution for the optimization process and prove their practical equivalence. Secondly, we propose a modification to the employed normalization method based on the signed absolute block maximum (BOF4-S), enabling further reduction of the quantization error and empirically achieving less degradation in language modeling performance. Thirdly, we explore additional variations of block-wise quantization methods applied to LLMs through an experimental study on the importance of accurately representing zero and large-amplitude weights on the one hand, and optimization towards various error metrics on the other hand. Lastly, we introduce a mixed-precision quantization strategy dubbed outlier-preserving quantization (OPQ) to address the distributional mismatch induced by outlier weights in block-wise quantization. By storing outlier weights in 16-bit precision (OPQ) while applying BOF4-S, we achieve top performance among 4-bit block-wise quantization techniques w.r.t. perplexity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing decentralized learning methods with differential privacy (DP) guarantee rely on constant gradient clipping bounds and fixed-level DP Gaussian noises for each node throughout the training process, leading to a significant accuracy degradation compared to non-private counterparts. In this paper, we propose a new Dynamic Differentially Private Decentralized learning approach (termed Dyn-D$^2$P) tailored for general time-varying directed networks. Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a scaling factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The distribution of child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) is an ever-growing concern of our modern world; children who suffered from this heinous crime are revictimized, and the growing amount of illegal imagery distributed overwhelms law enforcement agents (LEAs) with the manual labor of categorization. To ease this burden researchers have explored methods for automating data triage and detection of CSAI, but the sensitive nature of the data imposes restricted access and minimal interaction between real data and learning algorithms, avoiding leaks at all costs. In observing how these restrictions have shaped the literature we formalize a definition of "Proxy Tasks", i.e., the substitute tasks used for training models for CSAI without making use of CSA data. Under this new terminology we review current literature and present a protocol for making conscious use of Proxy Tasks together with consistent input from LEAs to design better automation in this field. Finally, we apply this protocol to study -- for the first time -- the task of Few-shot Indoor Scene Classification on CSAI, showing a final model that achieves promising results on a real-world CSAI dataset whilst having no weights actually trained on sensitive data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are increasingly recognized for their critical role in the pathogenesis and characterization of various human diseases. Consequently, the precise identification of snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs) is essential for the progression of diseases and the advancement of treatment strategies. However, conventional biological experimental approaches are costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive; therefore, machine learning-based computational methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these limitations. This paper proposes a model called 'GBDTSVM', representing a novel and efficient machine learning approach for predicting snoRNA-disease associations by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 'GBDTSVM' effectively extracts integrated snoRNA-disease feature representations utilizing GBDT and SVM is subsequently utilized to classify and identify potential associations. Furthermore, the method enhances the accuracy of these predictions by incorporating Gaussian kernel profile similarity for both snoRNAs and diseases. Experimental evaluation of the GBDTSVM model demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.96 and an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.95 on MDRF dataset. Moreover, our model shows superior performance on two more datasets named LSGT and PsnoD. Additionally, a case study on the predicted snoRNA-disease associations verified the top 10 predicted snoRNAs across nine prevalent diseases, further validating the efficacy of the GBDTSVM approach. These results underscore the model's potential as a robust tool for advancing snoRNA-related disease research. Source codes and datasets our proposed framework can be obtained from:this https URL

  Traditional Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in terms of efficiency and accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous environments where clients employ diverse model architectures and have varying computational resources. Such heterogeneity complicates the aggregation process, leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced model generalizability. To address these issues, we propose FedADP, a federated learning framework designed to adapt to client heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting model architectures during aggregation. FedADP enables effective collaboration among clients with differing capabilities, maximizing resource utilization and ensuring model quality. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedADP significantly outperforms existing methods, such as FlexiFed, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 23.30%, thereby enhancing model adaptability and training efficiency in heterogeneous real-world settings.

  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization in static datasets, avoiding the risks and costs of real-world exploration. However, it struggles with suboptimal behavior learning and inaccurate value estimation due to the lack of environmental interaction.

Leveraging model-based behavior guidance, VeoRL transfers commonsense knowledge of control policy and physical dynamics from natural videos to the RL agent within the target domain. Our method achieves substantial performance gains (exceeding 100% in some cases) across visuomotor control tasks in robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and open-world video games.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate in-context learning (ICL) through a meticulous experimental framework that systematically varies task complexity and model architecture. Extending beyond the linear regression baseline, we introduce Gaussian kernel regression and nonlinear dynamical system tasks, which emphasize temporal and recursive reasoning. We evaluate four distinct models: a GPT2-style Transformer, a Transformer with FlashAttention mechanism, a convolutional Hyena-based model, and the Mamba state-space model. Each model is trained from scratch on synthetic datasets and assessed for generalization during testing. Our findings highlight that model architecture significantly shapes ICL performance. The standard Transformer demonstrates robust performance across diverse tasks, while Mamba excels in temporally structured dynamics. Hyena effectively captures long-range dependencies but shows higher variance early in training, and FlashAttention offers computational efficiency but is more sensitive in low-data regimes. Further analysis uncovers locality-induced shortcuts in Gaussian kernel tasks, enhanced nonlinear separability through input range scaling, and the critical role of curriculum learning in mastering high-dimensional tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Lov√°sz hinge is a convex loss function proposed for binary structured classification, in which k related binary predictions jointly evaluated by a submodular function. Despite its prevalence in image segmentation and related tasks, the consistency of the Lov√°sz hinge has remained open. We show that the Lov√°sz hinge is inconsistent with its desired target unless the set function used for evaluation is modular. Leveraging the embedding framework of Finocchiaro et al. (2024), we find the target loss for which the Lov√°sz hinge is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem, is a variant of selective classification for structured prediction that allows one to abstain on any subset of the k binary predictions. We derive a family of link functions, each of which is simultaneously consistent for all polymatroids, a subset of submodular set functions. We then give sufficient conditions on the polymatroid for the structured abstain problem to be tightly embedded by the Lov√°sz hinge, meaning no target prediction is redundant. We experimentally demonstrate the potential of the structured abstain problem for interpretability in structured classification tasks. Finally, for the multiclass setting, we show that one can combine the binary encoding construction of Ramaswamy et al. (2018) with our link construction to achieve an efficient consistent surrogate for a natural multiclass generalization of the structured abstain problem.

  In modern assembly pipelines, identifying anomalies is crucial in ensuring product quality and operational efficiency. Conventional single-modality methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines. The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The datasets, codes to reproduce the results, supplementary materials, and demo are available atthis https URL.

  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to solve partial differential equations by incorporating physical laws directly into the loss function. However, the internal covariate shift, which has been largely overlooked, hinders the effective utilization of neural network capacity in PINNs. To this end, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture designed to address this issue in PINNs. Unlike traditional normalization methods such as BatchNorm or LayerNorm, we introduce a learnable, nonlinear mask function that constrains the feature distributions without violating underlying physics. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves feature distribution stability, accuracy, and robustness across various activation functions and PDE benchmarks. Furthermore, it enables the stable and efficient training of wider networks a capability that has been largely overlooked in PINNs.

  Latent space representations are critical for understanding and improving the behavior of machine learning models, yet they often remain obscure and intricate. Understanding and exploring the latent space has the potential to contribute valuable human intuition and expertise about respective domains. In this work, we present HILL, an interactive framework allowing users to incorporate human intuition into the model training by interactively reshaping latent space representations. The modifications are infused into the model training loop via a novel approach inspired by knowledge distillation, treating the user's modifications as a teacher to guide the model in reshaping its intrinsic latent representation. The process allows the model to converge more effectively and overcome inefficiencies, as well as provide beneficial insights to the user. We evaluated HILL in a user study tasking participants to train an optimal model, closely observing the employed strategies. The results demonstrated that human-guided latent space modifications enhance model performance while maintaining generalization, yet also revealing the risks of including user biases. Our work introduces a novel human-AI interaction paradigm that infuses human intuition into model training and critically examines the impact of human intervention on training strategies and potential biases.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific prompt design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The generation of voluminous scientific data poses significant challenges for efficient storage, transfer, and analysis. Recently, error-bounded lossy compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific data. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate a graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations. Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph autoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size of the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses the process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent representation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The decompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error bound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy methods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) has gained attention for extracting structured information from multimedia sources. Traditional methods tackle MIE tasks separately, missing opportunities to share knowledge across tasks. Recent approaches unify these tasks into a generation problem using instruction-based T5 models with visual adaptors, optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this method is computationally intensive, and multi-task fine-tuning often faces gradient conflicts, limiting performance. To address these challenges, we propose collaborative multi-LoRA experts with achievement-based multi-task loss (C-LoRAE) for MIE tasks. C-LoRAE extends the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method by incorporating a universal expert to learn shared multimodal knowledge from cross-MIE tasks and task-specific experts to learn specialized instructional task features. This configuration enhances the model's generalization ability across multiple tasks while maintaining the independence of various instruction tasks and mitigating gradient conflicts. Additionally, we propose an achievement-based multi-task loss to balance training progress across tasks, addressing the imbalance caused by varying numbers of training samples in MIE tasks. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets across three key MIE tasks demonstrate that C-LoRAE achieves superior overall performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods and LoRA methods while utilizing a comparable number of training parameters to LoRA.

  Computation-intensive tensor operators constitute over 90\% of the computations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Neuralthis http URLand efficiently generating high-performance tensor operators with hardware primitives is crucial for diverse and ever-evolving hardware architectures like RISC-V, ARM, and GPUs, as manually optimized implementation takes at least months and lacksthis http URLexcel at generating high-level language codes, but they struggle to fully comprehend hardware characteristics and produce high-performance tensor operators. We introduce a tensor-operator auto-generation framework with a one-line user prompt (QiMeng-TensorOp), which enables LLMs to automatically exploit hardware characteristics to generate tensor operators with hardware primitives, and tune parameters for optimal performance across diverse hardware. Experimental results on various hardware platforms, SOTA LLMs, and typical tensor operators demonstrate that QiMeng-TensorOp effectively unleashes the computing capability of various hardware platforms, and automatically generates tensor operators of superior performance.

  _Umberto Gon√ßalves de Sousa_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has transformed sequential decision making, yet traditional algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) often struggle with efficient exploration, stability, and adaptability in dynamic environments. This study presents ARDNS-FN-Quantum (Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator with Quantum enhancement), a novel framework that integrates a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selection, a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition, and adaptive exploration strategies modulated by reward variance and curiosity. Evaluated in a 10X10 grid-world over 20,000 episodes, ARDNS-FN-Quantum achieves a 99.5% success rate (versus 81.3% for DQN and 97.0% for PPO), a mean reward of 9.0528 across all episodes (versus 1.2941 for DQN and 7.6196 for PPO), and an average of 46.7 steps to goal (versus 135.9 for DQN and 62.5 for PPO). In the last 100 episodes, it records a mean reward of 9.1652 (versus 7.0916 for DQN and 9.0310 for PPO) and 37.2 steps to goal (versus 52.7 for DQN and 53.4 for PPO). Graphical analyses, including learning curves, steps-to-goal trends, reward variance, and reward distributions, demonstrate ARDNS-FN-Quantum's superior stability (reward variance 5.424 across all episodes versus 252.262 for DQN and 76.583 for PPO) and efficiency. By bridging quantum computing, cognitive science, and RL, ARDNS-FN-Quantum offers a scalable, human-like approach to adaptive learning in uncertain environments, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making under uncertainty.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) continue to be deployed and utilized across domains, the volume of LLM-generated data is growing rapidly. This trend highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with 14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates, exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.

  Accurate diagnosis of power transformer faults is essential for ensuring the stability and safety of electrical power systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL) algorithms for fault classification of power transformers. Using a condition-monitored dataset spanning 10 months, various gas concentration features were normalized and used to train five ML classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In addition, four DL models were evaluated: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and TabNet. Experimental results show that both ML and DL approaches performed comparably. The RF model achieved the highest ML accuracy at 86.82%, while the 1D-CNN model attained a close 86.30%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided. Code for IFL-GCL is publicly available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt engineering has shown remarkable success with large language models, yet its systematic exploration in computer vision remains limited. In semantic segmentation, both textual and visual prompts offer distinct advantages: textual prompts through open-vocabulary methods allow segmentation of arbitrary categories, while visual reference prompts provide intuitive reference examples. However, existing benchmarks evaluate these modalities in isolation, without direct comparison under identical conditions. We present Show or Tell (SoT), a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate both visual and textual prompts for semantic segmentation across 14 datasets spanning 7 diverse domains (common scenes, urban, food, waste, parts, tools, and land-cover). We evaluate 5 open-vocabulary methods and 4 visual reference prompt approaches, adapting the latter to handle multi-class segmentation through a confidence-based mask merging strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that open-vocabulary methods excel with common concepts easily described by text but struggle with complex domains like tools, while visual reference prompt methods achieve good average results but exhibit high variability depending on the input prompt. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of both prompting modalities, providing valuable insights to guide future research in vision foundation models for segmentation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-objective test-time alignment aims to adapt large language models (LLMs) to diverse multi-dimensional user preferences during inference while keeping LLMs frozen. Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently trains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension without awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on user-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective test-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for \textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training of ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user preferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a single unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our proposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs a bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to achieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Experiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better alignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally, PARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger frozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment accessible with limited computing resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance and its effectiveness in online settings.

  _Junzhou Xu, Boyu Diao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As deep learning models expand, the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm has become the standard approach for handling various downstream tasks. However, shared parameters can lead to diminished performance when dealing with complex datasets involving multiple tasks. While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly increases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time, introducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity LoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for Efficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of different tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using gradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a given budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly fine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA fine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while reducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model performance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its efficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires minimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it particularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources. All the code in this study will be made publicly available following the acceptance of the paper for publication. Source code is atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although deep learning models owe their remarkable success to deep and complex architectures, this very complexity typically comes at the expense of real-time performance. To address this issue, a variety of model compression techniques have been proposed, among which knowledge distillation (KD) stands out for its strong empirical performance. The KD contains two concurrent processes: (i) matching the outputs of a large, pre-trained teacher network and a lightweight student network, and (ii) training the student to solve its designated downstream task. The associated loss functions are termed the distillation loss and the downsteam-task loss, respectively. Numerous prior studies report that KD is most effective when the influence of the distillation loss outweighs that of the downstream-task loss. The influence(or importance) is typically regulated by a balancing parameter. This paper provides a mathematical rationale showing that in a simple KD setting when the loss is decreasing, the balancing parameter should be dynamically adjusted

  Climate system models (CSMs), through integrating cross-sphere interactions among the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere, have emerged as pivotal tools for deciphering climate dynamics and improving forecasting capabilities. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven meteorological modeling have demonstrated remarkable success in single-sphere systems and partially spheres coupled systems. However, the development of a fully coupled AI-based climate system model encompassing atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice interactions has remained an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces FengShun-CSM, an AI-based CSM model that provides 60-day global daily forecasts for 29 critical variables across atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and cryospheric domains. The model significantly outperforms the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) model in predicting most variables, particularly precipitation, land surface, and oceanic components. This enhanced capability is primarily attributed to its improved representation of intra-seasonal variability modes, most notably the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Remarkably, FengShun-CSM exhibits substantial potential in predicting subseasonal extreme events. Such breakthroughs will advance its applications in meteorological disaster mitigation, marine ecosystem conservation, and agricultural productivity enhancement. Furthermore, it validates the feasibility of developing AI-powered CSMs through machine learning technologies, establishing a transformative paradigm for next-generation Earth system modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The aggregation efficiency and accuracy of wireless Federated Learning (FL) are significantly affected by resource constraints, especially in heterogeneous environments where devices exhibit distinct data distributions and communication capabilities. This paper proposes a clustering strategy that leverages prior knowledge similarity to group devices with similar data and communication characteristics, mitigating performance degradation from heterogeneity. On this basis, a novel Cluster- Aware Multi-round Update (CAMU) strategy is proposed, which treats clusters as the basic units and adjusts the local update frequency based on the clustered contribution threshold, effectively reducing update bias and enhancing aggregation accuracy. The theoretical convergence of the CAMU strategy is rigorously validated. Meanwhile, based on the convergence upper bound, the local update frequency and transmission power of each cluster are jointly optimized to achieve an optimal balance between computation and communication resources under constrained conditions, significantly improving the convergence efficiency of FL. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the model performance of FL in heterogeneous environments and achieves a better balance between communication cost and computational load under limited resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agricultural monitoring is critical for ensuring food security, maintaining sustainable farming practices, informing policies on mitigating food shortage, and managing greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional process-based physical models are often designed and implemented for specific situations, and their parameters could also be highly uncertain. In contrast, data-driven models often use black-box structures and does not explicitly model the inter-dependence between different ecological variables. As a result, they require extensive training data and lack generalizability to different tasks with data distribution shifts and inconsistent observed variables. To address the need for more universal models, we propose a knowledge-guided encoder-decoder model, which can predict key crop variables by leveraging knowledge of underlying processes from multiple physical models. The proposed method also integrates a language model to process complex and inconsistent inputs and also utilizes it to implement a model selection mechanism for selectively combining the knowledge from different physical models. Our evaluations on predicting carbon and nitrogen fluxes for multiple sites demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model under various scenarios.

  This paper presents a new Computational Fluid Dynamics database, developed at ONERA, to support the advancement of machine learning techniques for aerodynamic field prediction. It contains 468 Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, performed on the NASA/Boeing Common Research Model wing-body-pylon-nacelle configuration. The database spans a wide range of flow conditions, varying Mach number (including transonic regimes), angle of attack (capturing flow separation), and Reynolds number (based on three stagnation pressures, with one setting matching wind tunnel experiments). The quality of the database is assessed, through checking the convergence level of each computation.Based on these data, a regression challenge is defined. It consists in predicting the wall distributions of pressure and friction coefficients for unseen aerodynamic conditions. The 468 simulations are split into training and testing sets, with the training data made available publicly on the Codabench platform. The paper further evaluates several classical machine learning regressors on this task. Tested pointwise methods include Multi-Layer Perceptrons, $\lambda$-DNNs, and Decision Trees, while global methods include Multi-Layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and IsoMap. Initial performance results, using $R^2$ scores and worst relative mean absolute error metrics, are presented, offering insights into the capabilities of these techniques for the challenge and references for future work.

  We introduce Dialz, a framework for advancing research on steering vectors for open-source LLMs, implemented in Python. Steering vectors allow users to modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g. honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer, more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.

  Given their widespread usage in the real world, the fairness of clustering methods has become of major interest. Theoretical results on fair clustering show that fairness enjoys transitivity: given a set of small and fair clusters, a trivial centroid-based clustering algorithm yields a fair clustering. Unfortunately, discovering a suitable starting clustering can be computationally expensive, rather complex or arbitrary.In this paper, we propose a set of simple \emph{clusterlet}-based fuzzy clustering algorithms that match single-class clusters, optimizing fair clustering. Matching leverages clusterlet distance, optimizing for classic clustering objectives, while also regularizing for fairness. Empirical results show that simple matching strategies are able to achieve high fairness, and that appropriate parameter tuning allows to achieve high cohesion and low overlap.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single GeForce RTX 3090 - all with only a 4.4$\%$ - 7.6$\%$ average performance degradation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module. The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding. Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to 9.6% over baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative similarity over artificial absolute similarity.

  Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems.

  _Bojian Yin, Federico Corradi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.

  Achieving generalization in neural approaches across different scales and distributions remains a significant challenge for the Traveling Salesman Problem~(TSP). A key obstacle is that neural networks often fail to learn robust principles for identifying universal patterns and deriving optimal solutions from diverse instances. In this paper, we first uncover Purity Law (PuLa), a fundamental structural principle for optimal TSP solutions, defining that edge prevalence grows exponentially with the sparsity of surrounding vertices. Statistically validated across diverse instances, PuLa reveals a consistent bias toward local sparsity in global optima. Building on this insight, we propose Purity Policy Optimization~(PUPO), a novel training paradigm that explicitly aligns characteristics of neural solutions with PuLa during the solution construction process to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUPO can be seamlessly integrated with popular neural solvers, significantly enhancing their generalization performance without incurring additional computational overhead during inference.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. Their ability to process and generate viable text and code has made them ubiquitous in many fields, while their deployment as knowledge bases and "reasoning" tools remains an area of ongoing research. In geography, a growing body of literature has been focusing on evaluating LLMs' geographical knowledge and their ability to perform spatial reasoning. However, very little is still known about the internal functioning of these models, especially about how they process geographical information.In this chapter, we establish a novel framework for the study of geospatial mechanistic interpretability - using spatial analysis to reverse engineer how LLMs handle geographical information. Our aim is to advance our understanding of the internal representations that these complex models generate while processing geographical information - what one might call "how LLMs think about geographic information" if such phrasing was not an undue anthropomorphism.We first outline the use of probing in revealing internal structures within LLMs. We then introduce the field of mechanistic interpretability, discussing the superposition hypothesis and the role of sparse autoencoders in disentangling polysemantic internal representations of LLMs into more interpretable, monosemantic features. In our experiments, we use spatial autocorrelation to show how features obtained for placenames display spatial patterns related to their geographic location and can thus be interpreted geospatially, providing insights into how these models process geographical information. We conclude by discussing how our framework can help shape the study and use of foundation models in geography.

  The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing use of complex machine learning models in education has led to concerns about their interpretability, which in turn has spurred interest in developing explainability techniques that are both faithful to the model's inner workings and intelligible to human end-users. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to creating a neural-network-based behavior detection model that is interpretable by design. Our model is fully interpretable, meaning that the parameters we extract for our explanations have a clear interpretation, fully capture the model's learned knowledge about the learner behavior of interest, and can be used to create explanations that are both faithful and intelligible. We achieve this by implementing a series of constraints to the model that both simplify its inference process and bring it closer to a human conception of the task at hand. We train the model to detect gaming-the-system behavior, evaluate its performance on this task, and compare its learned patterns to those identified by human experts. Our results show that the model is successfully able to learn patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior while providing evidence for fully interpretable explanations. We discuss the implications of our approach and suggest ways to evaluate explainability using a human-grounded approach.

  The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

  Tabular data remains one of the most prevalent and critical data formats across diverse real-world applications. However, its effective use in machine learning (ML) is often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging generative models to learn the distribution of real datasets and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving samples. Various generative paradigms have been explored, including energy-based models (EBMs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models. While several surveys have investigated synthetic tabular data generation, most focus on narrow subdomains or specific generative methods, such as GANs, diffusion models, or privacy-preserving techniques. This limited scope often results in fragmented insights, lacking a comprehensive synthesis that bridges diverse approaches. In particular, recent advances driven by LLMs and diffusion-based models remain underexplored. This gap hinders a holistic understanding of the field`s evolution, methodological interplay, and open challenges. To address this, our survey provides a unified and systematic review of synthetic tabular data generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes existing methods into traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, and provide an in-depth comparative analysis; (2) we detail the complete pipeline for synthetic tabular data generation, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation; (3) we identify major challenges, explore real-world applications, and outline open research questions and future directions to guide future work in this rapidly evolving area.

  Molecular generation plays an important role in drug discovery and materials science, especially in data-scarce scenarios where traditional generative models often struggle to achieve satisfactory conditional generalization. To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generativethis http URLresults demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

  Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate and reliable predictive models to facilitate early detection and intervention. While state of the art work has focused on various machine learning approaches for predicting heart disease, but they could not able to achieve remarkable accuracy. In response to this need, we applied nine machine learning algorithms XGBoost, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gaussian na√Øve bayes (NB gaussian), adaptive boosting, and linear regression to predict heart disease based on a range of physiological indicators. Our approach involved feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant predictors, aimed at refining the models to enhance both performance and interpretability. The models were trained, incorporating processes such as grid search hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to minimize overfitting. Additionally, we have developed a novel voting system with feature selection techniques to advance heart disease classification. Furthermore, we have evaluated the models using key performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving 99% accuracy, precision, F1-Score, 98% recall, and 100% ROC AUC. This study offers a promising approach to early heart disease diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

  Node importance estimation, a classical problem in network analysis, underpins various web applications. Previous methods either exploit intrinsic topological characteristics, e.g., graph centrality, or leverage additional information, e.g., data heterogeneity, for node feature enhancement. However, these methods follow the supervised learning setting, overlooking the fact that ground-truth node-importance data are usually partially labeled in practice. In this work, we propose the first semi-supervised node importance estimation framework, i.e., EASING, to improve learning quality for unlabeled data in heterogeneous graphs. Different from previous approaches, EASING explicitly captures uncertainty to reflect the confidence of model predictions. To jointly estimate the importance values and uncertainties, EASING incorporates DJE, a deep encoder-decoder neural architecture. DJE introduces distribution modeling for graph nodes, where the distribution representations derive both importance and uncertainty estimates. Additionally, DJE facilitates effective pseudo-label generation for the unlabeled data to enrich the training samples. Based on labeled and pseudo-labeled data, EASING develops effective semi-supervised heteroscedastic learning with varying node uncertainty regularization. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets highlight the superior performance of EASING compared to competing methods. Codes are available viathis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linear RNNs with gating recently demonstrated competitive performance compared to Transformers in language modeling. Although their linear compute scaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over Transformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom kernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels (Dao, 2024). Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear Attention (FLA) (Yang & Zhang, 2024) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention, by parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk size of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU memory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory consumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. In this work, we present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes and high arithmetic intensity by introducing an additional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, we apply TFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM (Beck et al., 2024). Second, we propose an mLSTM variant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for even faster kernel runtimes at equal language modeling performance. In our speed benchmarks, we show that our new mLSTM kernels based on TFLA outperform highly optimized Flash Attention, Linear Attention and Mamba kernels, setting a new state of the art for efficient long-context sequence modeling primitives.

  Predicting human decision-making under risk and uncertainty is a long-standing challenge in cognitive science, economics, and AI. While prior research has focused on numerically described lotteries, real-world decisions often rely on textual descriptions. This study conducts the first large-scale exploration of human decision-making in such tasks using a large dataset of one-shot binary choices between textually described lotteries. We evaluate multiple computational approaches, including fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging embeddings, and integrating behavioral theories of choice under risk. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs, specifically GPT-4o, outperform hybrid models that incorporate behavioral theory, challenging established methods in numerical settings. These findings highlight fundamental differences in how textual and numerical information influence decision-making and underscore the need for new modeling strategies to bridge this gap.

  The remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) have led many to conclude that they exhibit a form of intelligence. This is as opposed to explanations of their capabilities based on their ability to perform relatively simple manipulations of vast volumes of data. To illuminate the distinction between these explanations, we introduce a novel generative model that generates tokens on the basis of human-interpretable concepts represented as latent discrete variables. Under mild conditions, even when the mapping from the latent space to the observed space is non-invertible, we establish an identifiability result, i.e., the representations learned by LLMs through next-token prediction can be approximately modeled as the logarithm of the posterior probabilities of these latent discrete concepts given input context, up to an invertible linear transformation. This theoretical finding not only provides evidence that LLMs capture underlying generative factors, but also provide a unified prospective for understanding of the linear representation hypothesis. Taking this a step further, our finding motivates a reliable evaluation of sparse autoencoders by treating the performance of supervised concept extractors as an upper bound. Pushing this idea even further, it inspires a structural variant that enforces dependence among latent concepts in addition to promoting sparsity. Empirically, we validate our theoretical results through evaluations on both simulation data and the Pythia, Llama, and DeepSeek model families, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our structured sparse autoencoder.

  Accurate prediction of urban spatiotemporal dynamics is essential for enhancing urban management and decision-making. Existing spatiotemporal prediction models are predominantly deterministic, focusing on primary spatiotemporal patterns. However, those dynamics are highly complex, exhibiting multi-modal distributions that are challenging for deterministic models to capture. In this paper, we highlight the critical role of probabilistic prediction in capturing the uncertainties and complexities inherent in spatiotemporal data. While mainstream probabilistic models can capture uncertainty, they struggle with accurately learning primary patterns and often suffer from computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, we propose CoST, which collaborates deterministic and probabilistic models to improve both predictive accuracy and the ability to handle uncertainty. To achieve this, we design a mean-residual decomposition framework, where the mean value is modeled by a deterministic model, and the residual variations are learned by a probabilistic model, specifically diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce a scale-aware diffusion process, which better accounts for spatially heterogeneous dynamics across different regions. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that CoST significantly outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic metrics, achieving a 20% improvement with low computational cost. CoST bridges the gap between deterministic precision and probabilistic uncertainty, making a significant advancement in the field of urban spatiotemporal prediction.

  Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) -- that is the causal effect of a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or interventions), referred to as \textit{composite treatments}, on a set of outcome variables of interest, referred to as \textit{composite outcomes}, for a unit from observational data -- remains a fundamental problem in causal inference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics, education, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in causal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like single treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex real-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different ICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for heart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation and in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and outcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative hypernetwork-based approach, called \emph{H-Learner}, to solve ITE estimation under composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data scarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and outcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments and outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.

  Learning well-separated features in high-dimensional spaces, such as text or image embeddings, is crucial for many machine learning applications. Achieving such separation can be effectively accomplished through the dispersion of embeddings, where unrelated vectors are pushed apart as much as possible. By constraining features to be on a hypersphere, we can connect dispersion to well-studied problems in mathematics and physics, where optimal solutions are known for limited low-dimensional cases. However, in representation learning we typically deal with a large number of features in high-dimensional space, and moreover, dispersion is usually traded off with some other task-oriented training objective, making existing theoretical and numerical solutions inapplicable. Therefore, it is common to rely on gradient-based methods to encourage dispersion, usually by minimizing some function of the pairwise distances. In this work, we first give an overview of existing methods from disconnected literature, making new connections and highlighting similarities. Next, we introduce some new angles. We propose to reinterpret pairwise dispersion using a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) motivation. We then propose an online variant of the celebrated Lloyd's algorithm, of K-Means fame, as an effective alternative regularizer for dispersion on generic domains. Finally, we derive a novel dispersion method that directly exploits properties of the hypersphere. Our experiments show the importance of dispersion in image classification and natural language processing tasks, and how algorithms exhibit different trade-offs in different regimes.

  Sample selection is a prevalent approach in learning with noisy labels, aiming to identify confident samples for training. Although existing sample selection methods have achieved decent results by reducing the noise rate of the selected subset, they often overlook that not all mislabeled examples harm the model's performance equally. In this paper, we demonstrate that mislabeled examples correctly predicted by the model early in the training process are particularly harmful to model performance. We refer to these examples as Mislabeled Easy Examples (MEEs). To address this, we propose Early Cutting, which introduces a recalibration step that employs the model's later training state to re-select the confident subset identified early in training, thereby avoiding misleading confidence from early learning and effectively filtering out MEEs. Experiments on the CIFAR, WebVision, and full ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that our method effectively improves sample selection and model performance by reducing MEEs.

  Efficient exploration is critical for learning relational models in large-scale environments with complex, long-horizon tasks. Random exploration methods often collect redundant or irrelevant data, limiting their ability to learn accurate relational models of the environment. Goal-literal babbling (GLIB) improves upon random exploration by setting and planning to novel goals, but its reliance on random actions and random novel goal selection limits its scalability to larger domains. In this work, we identify the principles underlying efficient exploration in relational domains: (1) operator initialization with demonstrations that cover the distinct lifted effects necessary for planning and (2) refining preconditions to collect maximally informative transitions by selecting informative goal-action pairs and executing plans to them. To demonstrate these principles, we introduce Baking-Large, a challenging domain with extensive state-action spaces and long-horizon tasks. We evaluate methods using oracle-driven demonstrations for operator initialization and precondition-targeting guidance to efficiently gather critical transitions. Experiments show that both the oracle demonstrations and precondition-targeting oracle guidance significantly improve sample efficiency and generalization, paving the way for future methods to use these principles to efficiently learn accurate relational models in complex domains.

  Human label variation (HLV) challenges the standard assumption that a labelled instance has a single ground truth, instead embracing the natural variation in human annotation to train and evaluate models. While various training methods and metrics for HLV have been proposed, it is still unclear which methods and metrics perform best in what settings. We propose new evaluation metrics for HLV leveraging fuzzy set theory. Since these new proposed metrics are differentiable, we then in turn experiment with employing these metrics as training objectives. We conduct an extensive study over 6 HLV datasets testing 14 training methods and 6 evaluation metrics. We find that training on either disaggregated annotations or soft labels performs best across metrics, outperforming training using the proposed training objectives with differentiable metrics. We also show that our proposed soft metric is more interpretable and correlates best with human preference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning agents face significant deployment challenges due to the synthetic-to-real distribution mismatch. While most prior research has focused on improving the fidelity of synthetic sampling and incorporating off-policy mechanisms, the directly integrated paradigm often fails to ensure consistent policy behavior in biased models and underlying environmental dynamics, which inherently arise from discrepancies between behavior and learning policies. In this paper, we first shift the focus from model reliability to policy discrepancies while optimizing for expected returns, and then self-consistently incorporate synthetic data, deriving a novel actor-critic paradigm, Dual Alignment Maximin Optimization (DAMO). It is a unified framework to ensure both model-environment policy consistency and synthetic and offline data compatibility. The inner minimization performs dual conservative value estimation, aligning policies and trajectories to avoid out-of-distribution states and actions, while the outer maximization ensures that policy improvements remain consistent with inner value estimates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DAMO effectively ensures model and policy alignments, achieving competitive performance across diverse benchmark tasks.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods via joint embedding architectures have proven remarkably effective at capturing semantically rich representations with strong clustering properties, magically in the absence of label supervision. Despite this, few of them have explored leveraging these untapped properties to improve themselves. In this paper, we provide an evidence through various metrics that the encoder's output $encoding$ exhibits superior and more stable clustering properties compared to other components. Building on this insight, we propose a novel positive-feedback SSL method, termed Representation Self-Assignment (ReSA), which leverages the model's clustering properties to promote learning in a self-guided manner. Extensive experiments on standard SSL benchmarks reveal that models pretrained with ReSA outperform other state-of-the-art SSL methods by a significant margin. Finally, we analyze how ReSA facilitates better clustering properties, demonstrating that it effectively enhances clustering performance at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels, shaping representations that are inherently more structured and semantically meaningful.

  For almost 70 years, researchers have mostly relied on hyper-parameter tuning to select the width of neural networks' layers. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing an easy-to-use technique to learn an unbounded width of a neural network's layer during training. The technique does not rely on alternate optimization nor hand-crafted gradient heuristics; rather, it jointly optimizes the width and the parameters of each layer via simple backpropagation. We apply the technique to a broad range of data domains such as tables, images, text, sequences, and graphs, showing how the width adapts to the task's difficulty. The method imposes a soft ordering of importance among neurons, by which it also is possible to truncate the trained network at virtually zero cost, achieving a smooth trade-off between performance and compute resources in a structured way. Alternatively, one can dynamically compress the network with no performance degradation. In light of recent foundation models trained on large datasets, believed to require billions of parameters and where hyper-parameter tuning is unfeasible due to humongous training costs, our approach stands as a viable alternative for width learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in various graph-based learning tasks. However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.

  _Cen-You Li, Marc Toussaint, Barbara Rakitsch, Christoph Zimmer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe active learning (AL) is a sequential scheme for learning unknown systems while respecting safety constraints during data acquisition. Existing methods often rely on Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the task and safety constraints, requiring repeated GP updates and constrained acquisition optimization-incurring in significant computations which are challenging for real-time decision-making. We propose an amortized safe AL framework that replaces expensive online computations with a pretrained neural policy. Inspired by recent advances in amortized Bayesian experimental design, we turn GPs into a pretraining simulator. We train our policy prior to the AL deployment on simulated nonparametric functions, using Fourier feature-based GP sampling and a differentiable, safety-aware acquisition objective. At deployment, our policy selects safe and informative queries via a single forward pass, eliminating the need for GP inference or constrained optimization. This leads to substantial speed improvements while preserving safety and learning quality. Our framework is modular and can be adapted to unconstrained, time-sensitive AL tasks by omitting the safety requirement.

  Dynamic graph embedding has emerged as an important technique for modeling complex time-evolving networks across diverse domains. While transformer-based models have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies in temporal graph data, they face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. This study presents a comparative analysis of dynamic graph embedding approaches using transformers and the recently proposed Mamba architecture, a state-space model with linear complexity. We introduce three novel models: TransformerG2G augment with graph convolutional networks, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba, and \mathcal{GDG}-Mamba with graph isomorphism network edge convolutions. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Mamba-based models achieve comparable or superior performance to transformer-based approaches in link prediction tasks while offering significant computational efficiency gains on longer sequences. Notably, \mathcal{DG}-Mamba variants consistently outperform transformer-based models on datasets with high temporal variability, such as UCI, Bitcoin, and Reality Mining, while maintaining competitive performance on more stable graphs like SBM. We provide insights into the learned temporal dependencies through analysis of attention weights and state matrices, revealing the models' ability to capture complex temporal patterns. By effectively combining state-space models with graph neural networks, our work addresses key limitations of previous approaches and contributes to the growing body of research on efficient temporal graph representation learning. These findings offer promising directions for scaling dynamic graph embedding to larger, more complex real-world networks, potentially enabling new applications in areas such as social network analysis, financial modeling, and biological system dynamics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised Outlier Detection (UOD) is a critical task in data mining and machine learning, aiming to identify instances that significantly deviate from the majority. Without any label, deep UOD methods struggle with the misalignment between the model's direct optimization goal and the final performance goal of Outlier Detection (OD) task. Through the perspective of training dynamics, this paper proposes an early stopping algorithm to optimize the training of deep UOD models, ensuring they perform optimally in OD rather than overfitting the entire contaminated dataset.Inspired by UOD mechanism and inlier priority phenomenon, where intuitively models fit inliers more quickly than outliers, we propose GradStop, a sampling-based label-free algorithm to estimate model's real-time performance during training. First, a sampling method generates two sets: one likely containing more outliers and the other more inliers, then a metric based on gradient cohesion is applied to probe into current training dynamics, which reflects model's performance on OD task.Experimental results on 4 deep UOD algorithms and 47 real-world datasets and theoretical proofs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed early stopping algorithm in enhancing the performance of deep UOD models. Auto Encoder (AE) enhanced by GradStop achieves better performance than itself, other SOTA UOD methods, and even ensemble AEs. Our method provides a robust and effective solution to the problem of performance degradation during training, enabling deep UOD models to achieve better potential in anomaly detection tasks.

  Multiphysics simulation, which models the interactions between multiple physical processes, and multi-component simulation of complex structures are critical in fields like nuclear and aerospace engineering. Previous studies use numerical solvers or ML-based surrogate models for these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each for a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, existing numerical algorithms struggle with highly complex large-scale structures in multi-component simulations. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component PDE Simulation with Diffusion models (M2PDE) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, M2PDE learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, M2PDE generates coupled multiphysics and multi-component solutions by sampling from the joint probability distribution. We evaluate M2PDE on two multiphysics tasks-reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling-where it achieves more accurate predictions than surrogate models in challenging scenarios. We then apply it to a multi-component prismatic fuel element problem, demonstrating that M2PDE scales from single-component training to a 64-component structure and outperforms existing domain-decomposition and graph-based approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention-based architectures have become ubiquitous in time series forecasting tasks, including spatio-temporal (STF) and long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). Yet, our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we propose a novel pruning strategy, $\textbf{R}$eplace $\textbf{A}$ttention with $\textbf{M}$LP (RAM), that approximates the attention mechanism using only feedforward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization for temporal and/or spatial modeling in multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, the Q, K, and V projections, the attention score calculation, the dot-product between the attention score and the V, and the final projection can be removed from the attention-based networks without significantly degrading the performance, so that the given network remains the top-tier compared to other SOTA methods. RAM achieves a $62.579\%$ reduction in FLOPs for spatio-temporal models with less than $2.5\%$ performance drop, and a $42.233\%$ FLOPs reduction for LTSF models with less than $2\%$ performance drop.

  Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills directly from expert demonstrations, providing a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning. However, prior online IL approaches struggle with complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional inputs and complex dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that leverages reward-free world models. Our method learns environmental dynamics entirely in latent spaces without reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate modeling. We adopt the inverse soft-Q learning objective, reformulating the optimization process in the Q-policy space to mitigate the instability associated with traditional optimization in the reward-policy space. By employing a learned latent dynamics model and planning for control, our approach consistently achieves stable, expert-level performance in tasks with high-dimensional observation or action spaces and intricate dynamics. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of benchmarks, including DMControl, MyoSuite, and ManiSkill2, demonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success by leveraging label information; however, determining positive samples in multi-label scenarios remains a critical challenge. In multi-label supervised contrastive learning (MSCL), multi-label relations are not yet fully defined, leading to ambiguity in identifying positive samples and formulating contrastive loss functions to construct the representation space. To address these challenges, we: (i) first define five distinct multi-label relations in MSCL to systematically identify positive samples, (ii) introduce a novel Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss that dynamically re-weights samples through computing the similarity and dissimilarity factors between positive samples and given anchors based on multi-label relations, and (iii) further provide theoretical grounded proofs for our method through rigorous mathematical analysis that supports the formulation and effectiveness of the proposed loss function. We conduct the experiments across both image and text modalities, and extend the evaluation to medical domain. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in a comprehensive evaluation, confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning six decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.3%. Furthermore, combining self-data distilled models through model merging yields enhanced quality retention. Additionally, leveraging these pruned models in speculative decoding increases token acceptance rates, thereby improving inference efficiency in applied settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are a widely used method for local feature attribution in interpretable and explainable AI. We propose an efficient two-stage algorithm for computing SHAP values in both black-box setting and tree-based models. Motivated by spectral bias in real-world predictors, we first approximate models using compact Fourier representations, exactly for trees and approximately for black-box models. In the second stage, we introduce a closed-form formula for {\em exactly} computing SHAP values using the Fourier representation, that ``linearizes'' the computation into a simple summation and is amenable to parallelization. As the Fourier approximation is computed only once, our method enables amortized SHAP value computation, achieving significant speedups over existing methods and a tunable trade-off between efficiency and precision.

  Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is revolutionizing the computing industry. Not only its applications have broadened to various sectors but also poses new system design and optimization opportunities. The technology is capable of understanding and responding in multiple modalities. However, the advanced capability currently comes with significant system resource demands. To sustainably scale generative AI capabilities to billions of users in the world, inference must be fast and efficient. This paper pinpoints key system design and optimization opportunities by characterizing a family of emerging multi-modal generation models on real systems. Auto-regressive token generation is a critical latency performance bottleneck, typically dominated by GPU idle time. In addition to memory-intensive attention across the generative AI models, linear operations constitute significant inference latency due to the feed forward networks in Transformer-based models. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art optimization levers, spanning from applications to system software and hardware, set a 3.88x better baseline.

  Recent work has shown that Transformers trained from scratch can successfully solve various arithmetic and algorithmic tasks, such as adding numbers and computing parity. While these Transformers generalize well on unseen inputs of the same length, they struggle with length generalization, i.e., handling inputs of unseen lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that looped Transformers with an adaptive number of steps significantly improve length generalization. We focus on tasks with a known iterative solution, involving multiple iterations of a RASP-L operation - a length-generalizable operation that can be expressed by a finite-sized Transformer. We train looped Transformers using our proposed learning algorithm and observe that they learn highly length-generalizable solutions for various tasks.

  Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) extends classical algorithms to higher dimensional data. However, canonical implementations of NAR train neural networks to return only a single solution, even when there are multiple correct solutions to a problem, such as single-source shortest paths. For some applications, it is desirable to recover more than one correct solution. To that end, we give the first method for NAR with multiple solutions. We demonstrate our method on two classical algorithms: Bellman-Ford (BF) and Depth-First Search (DFS), favouring deeper insight into two algorithms over a broader survey of algorithms. This method involves generating appropriate training data as well as sampling and validating solutions from model output. Each step of our method, which can serve as a framework for neural algorithmic reasoning beyond the tasks presented in this paper, might be of independent interest to the field and our results represent the first attempt at this task in the NAR literature.

  Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that diffusion models can effectively learn the image distribution and generate new samples. Remarkably, these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, (ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across diverse tasks but often require targeted adaptations for specific applications. Various methods have been proposed to facilitate this adaptation, including fewshot fine-tuning, in-context learning, and context distillation. This paper specifically investigates context distillation a method that extends the utility of task-specific examples by internalizing them, thus augmenting the example set accessible for model inference. We conduct a comparative analysis of context distillation with in-context learning (ICL) and few-shot fine-tuning (FT), aiming to ascertain the efficacy of context distillation in adapting models using minimal in-context examples. Employing matched datasets from Mobach, our experiments leverage OPT models of various sizes. The results indicate that context distillation effectively adapts models, with student models attaining comparable in-domain and out-of-domain accuracies to in-context learning. Although context distillation surpasses ICL in out-of-domain generalization, it does not achieve the performance levels of FT. However, the reduced dataset size and computational demands position context distillation as a viable alternative, especially for smaller datasets. Overall, this study presents context distillation as an efficient and potent method for customizing LLMs to specific tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Encoding geospatial objects is fundamental for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) applications, which leverage machine learning (ML) models to analyze spatial information. Common approaches transform each object into known formats, like image and text, for compatibility with ML models. However, this process often discards crucial spatial information, such as the object's position relative to the entire space, reducing downstream task effectiveness. Alternative encoding methods that preserve some spatial properties are often devised for specific data objects (e.g., point encoders), making them unsuitable for tasks that involve different data types (i.e., points, polylines, and polygons). To this end, we propose Poly2Vec, a polymorphic Fourier-based encoding approach that unifies the representation of geospatial objects, while preserving the essential spatial properties. Poly2Vec incorporates a learned fusion module that adaptively integrates the magnitude and phase of the Fourier transform for different tasks and geometries. We evaluate Poly2Vec on five diverse tasks, organized into two categories. The first empirically demonstrates that Poly2Vec consistently outperforms object-specific baselines in preserving three key spatial relationships: topology, direction, and distance. The second shows that integrating Poly2Vec into a state-of-the-art GeoAI workflow improves the performance in two popular tasks: population prediction and land use inference.

  As large language models (LLMs) grow in size and deployment scale, quantization has become an essential technique for reducing memory footprint and improving inference efficiency. However, existing quantization toolkits often lack transparency, flexibility, and system-level scalability across GPUs and distributed environments. We present \textbf{LLMEasyQuant}, a modular, system-aware quantization framework designed for efficient, low-bit inference of LLMs on single-node multi-GPU, multi-node, and edge hardware. LLMEasyQuant supports a wide range of quantization methods -- including Symmetric Quantization, ZeroQuant, SmoothQuant, and SimQuant -- with unified interfaces for per-layer calibration, bitwidth assignment, and runtime adaptation. It integrates fused CUDA kernels with NCCL-based distributed synchronization and supports both static and online quantization. Empirical results show that LLMEasyQuant can achieve substantial speedups in GEMM execution, HBM load time, and near-linear multi-GPU scaling. Ablation studies further validate its ability to balance latency, memory, and accuracy under diverse deployment conditions. LLMEasyQuant offers a practical quantization serving system for scalable, hardware-optimized LLM inference.

  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted widespread attention for their impressive capability of graph representation learning. However, the increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs presents a significant challenge for GNN training due to their computational demands, limiting the applicability of GNNs in various scenarios. In response to this challenge, graph condensation (GC) is proposed as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on generating an informative compact graph that enables efficient training of GNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to accelerate GNN training, existing GC methods overlook the quality of large training graphs during both the training and inference stages. They indiscriminately emulate the training graph distributions, making the condensed graphs susceptible to noises within the training graph and significantly impeding the application of GC in intricate real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose robust graph condensation (RobGC), a plug-and-play approach for GC to extend the robustness and applicability of condensed graphs in noisy graph structure environments. Specifically, RobGC leverages the condensed graph as a feedback signal to guide the denoising process on the original training graph. A label propagation-based alternating optimization strategy is in place for the condensation and denoising processes, contributing to the mutual purification of the condensed graph and training graph. Additionally, as a GC method designed for inductive graph inference, RobGC facilitates test-time graph denoising by leveraging the noise-free condensed graph to calibrate the structure of the test graph. Extensive experiments show that RobGC is compatible with various GC methods, significantly boosting their robustness under different types and levels of graph structural noises.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.

  The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision Tree (DT) Learning is a fundamental problem in Interpretable Machine Learning, yet it poses a formidable optimisation challenge. Practical algorithms have recently emerged, primarily leveraging Dynamic Programming and Branch & Bound. However, most of these approaches rely on a Depth-First-Search strategy, which is inefficient when searching for DTs at high depths and requires the definition of a maximum depth hyperparameter. Best-First-Search was also employed by other methods to circumvent these issues. The downside of this strategy is its higher memory consumption, as such, it has to be designed in a fully efficient manner that takes full advantage of the problem's structure. We formulate the problem within an AND/OR graph search framework and we solve it with a novel AO*-type algorithm called Branches. We prove both optimality and complexity guarantees for Branches and we show that it is more efficient than the state of the art theoretically and on a variety of experiments. Furthermore, Branches supports non-binary features unlike the other methods, we show that this property can further induce larger gains in computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for conditional sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods.

  We propose a neural operator framework, termed mixture density nonlinear manifold decoder (MD-NOMAD), for stochastic simulators. Our approach leverages an amalgamation of the pointwise operator learning neural architecture nonlinear manifold decoder (NOMAD) with mixture density-based methods to estimate conditional probability distributions for stochastic output functions. MD-NOMAD harnesses the ability of probabilistic mixture models to estimate complex probability and the high-dimensional scalability of pointwise neural operator NOMAD. We conduct empirical assessments on a wide array of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations and present the corresponding results, which highlight the performance of the proposed framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present two Policy Gradient-based algorithms with general parametrization in the context of infinite-horizon average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP). The first one employs Implicit Gradient Transport for variance reduction, ensuring an expected regret of the order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$. The second approach, rooted in Hessian-based techniques, ensures an expected regret of the order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$. These results significantly improve the state-of-the-art $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret and achieve the theoretical lower bound. We also show that the average-reward function is approximately $L$-smooth, a result that was previously assumed in earlier works.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating the test performance of a model, possibly under distribution shift, without having access to the ground-truth labels is a challenging, yet very important problem for the safe deployment of machine learning algorithms in the wild. Existing works mostly rely on information from either the outputs or the extracted features of neural networks to estimate a score that correlates with the ground-truth test accuracy. In this paper, we investigate -- both empirically and theoretically -- how the information provided by the gradients can be predictive of the ground-truth test accuracy even under distribution shifts. More specifically, we use the norm of classification-layer gradients, backpropagated from the cross-entropy loss after only one gradient step over test data. Our intuition is that these gradients should be of higher magnitude when the model generalizes poorly. We provide the theoretical insights behind our approach and the key ingredients that ensure its empirical success. Extensive experiments conducted with various architectures on diverse distribution shifts demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-range interactions are essential for the correct description of complex systems in many scientific fields. The price to pay for including them in the calculations, however, is a dramatic increase in the overall computational costs. Recently, deep graph networks have been employed as efficient, data-driven models for predicting properties of complex systems represented as graphs. These models rely on a message passing strategy that should, in principle, capture long-range information without explicitly modeling the corresponding interactions. In practice, most deep graph networks cannot really model long-range dependencies due to the intrinsic limitations of (synchronous) message passing, namely oversmoothing, oversquashing, and underreaching. This work proposes a general framework that learns to mitigate these limitations: within a variational inference framework, we endow message passing architectures with the ability to adapt their depth and filter messages along the way. With theoretical and empirical arguments, we show that this strategy better captures long-range interactions, by competing with the state of the art on five node and graph prediction datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Individual trajectories, rich in human-environment interaction information across space and time, serve as vital inputs for geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs). However, existing attempts at learning trajectory representations have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories, failing to encode such dependency in a deep learning-friendly format. That poses a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions in both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion), to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. Analyzing spatial-temporal features presented in latent space validates that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This study may also benefit representation learnings of other geospatial data to achieve general-purpose data representations and advance GeoFMs development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning strategies--diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of edge devices often leads to inconsistent performance of the globally trained models, resulting in unfair outcomes among users. Existing federated fairness algorithms strive to enhance fairness but often fall short in maintaining the overall performance of the global model, typically measured by the average accuracy across all clients. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm that leverages entropy-based aggregation combined with model and gradient alignments to simultaneously optimize fairness and global model performance. Our method employs a bi-level optimization framework, where we derive an analytic solution to the aggregation probability in the inner loop, making the optimization process computationally efficient. Additionally, we introduce an innovative alignment update and an adaptive strategy in the outer loop to further balance global model's performance and fairness. Theoretical analysis indicates that our approach guarantees convergence even in non-convex FL settings and demonstrates significant fairness improvements in generalized regression and strongly convex models. Empirically, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art federated fairness algorithms, ensuring consistent performance among clients while improving the overall performance of the global model.

  With an increase in the capabilities of generative language models, a growing interest in embodied AI has followed. This contribution introduces RAI - a framework for creating embodied Multi Agent Systems for robotics. The proposed framework implements tools for Agents' integration with robotic stacks, Large Language Models, and simulations. It provides out-of-the-box integration with state-of-the-art systems like ROS 2. It also comes with dedicated mechanisms for the embodiment of Agents. These mechanisms have been tested on a physical robot, Husarion ROSBot XL, which was coupled with its digital twin, for rapid prototyping.

All of these deployments have been evaluated in terms of their control capabilities, effectiveness of embodiment, and perception ability. The proposed framework has been used successfully to build systems with multiple agents. It has demonstrated effectiveness in all the aforementioned tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning faces significant challenges in effectively organizing agent relationships and facilitating information exchange, particularly when agents need to adapt their coordination patterns dynamically. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates dynamic spectral clustering with hypergraph neural networks to enable adaptive group formation and efficient information processing in multi-agent systems. The proposed framework dynamically constructs and updates hypergraph structures through spectral clustering on agents' state histories, enabling higher-order relationships to emerge naturally from agent interactions. The hypergraph structure is enhanced with attention mechanisms for selective information processing, providing an expressive and efficient way to model complex agent relationships. This architecture can be implemented in both value-based and policy-based paradigms through a unified objective combining task performance with structural regularization. Extensive experiments on challenging cooperative tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both sample efficiency and final performance.

  With the rapid proliferation of large language models and vision-language models, AI agents have evolved from isolated, task-specific systems into autonomous, interactive entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting without human intervention. As these agents proliferate across virtual and physical environments, from virtual assistants to embodied robots, the need for a unified, agent-centric infrastructure becomes paramount. In this survey, we introduce the Internet of Agents (IoA) as a foundational framework that enables seamless interconnection, dynamic discovery, and collaborative orchestration among heterogeneous agents at scale. We begin by presenting a general IoA architecture, highlighting its hierarchical organization, distinguishing features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next, we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task matching, consensus and conflict-resolution mechanisms, and incentive models. Finally, we identify open research directions toward building resilient and trustworthy IoA ecosystems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the existing transportation infrastructure offers a promising solution to alleviate congestion and enhance mobility. This research explores a novel approach to traffic optimization by employing a multi-agent rollout approach within a mixed autonomy environment. The study concentrates on coordinating the speed of human-driven vehicles by longitudinally controlling AVs, aiming to dynamically optimize traffic flow and alleviate congestion at highway bottlenecks in real-time. We model the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and propose an improved multi-agent rollout algorithm. By employing agent-by-agent policy iterations, our approach implicitly considers cooperation among multiple agents and seamlessly adapts to complex scenarios where the number of agents dynamically varies. Validated in a real-world network with varying AV penetration rates and traffic flow, the simulations demonstrate that the multi-agent rollout algorithm significantly enhances performance, reducing average travel time on bottleneck segments by 9.42% with a 10% AV penetration rate.

  Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains $\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$ average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

  We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

  Acoustophoresis has enabled novel interaction capabilities, such as levitation, volumetric displays, mid-air haptic feedback, and directional sound generation, to open new forms of multimodal interactions. However, its traditional implementation as a singular static unit limits its dynamic range and application versatility. This paper introduces AcoustoBots - a novel convergence of acoustophoresis with a movable and reconfigurable phased array of transducers for enhanced application versatility. We mount a phased array of transducers on a swarm of robots to harness the benefits of multiple mobile acoustophoretic units. This offers a more flexible and interactive platform that enables a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. Our novel AcoustoBots design includes a hinge actuation system that controls the orientation of the mounted phased array of transducers to achieve high flexibility in a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. In addition, we designed a BeadDispenserBot that can deliver particles to trapping locations, which automates the acoustic levitation interaction. These attributes allow AcoustoBots to independently work for a common cause and interchange between modalities, allowing for novel augmentations (e.g., a swarm of haptics, audio, and levitation) and bilateral interactions with users in an expanded interaction area. We detail our design considerations, challenges, and methodological approach to extend acoustophoretic central control in distributed settings. This work demonstrates a scalable acoustic control framework with two mobile robots, laying the groundwork for future deployment in larger robotic swarms. Finally, we characterize the performance of our AcoustoBots and explore the potential interactive scenarios they can enable.

  Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

  We present a novel algorithm for large-scale Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) that enables fast, scalable planning in dynamic environments such as automated warehouses. Our approach introduces finite-horizon hierarchical factorization, a framework that plans one step at a time in a receding-horizon fashion. Robots first compute individual plans in parallel, and then dynamically group based on spatio-temporal conflicts and reachability. The framework accounts for conflict resolution, and for immediate execution and concurrent planning, significantly reducing response time compared to offline algorithms. Experimental results on benchmark maps demonstrate that our method achieves up to 60% reduction in time-to-first-action while consistently delivering high-quality solutions, outperforming state-of-the-art offline baselines across a range of problem sizes and planning horizons.

  User privacy is a crucial concern in robotic applications, especially when mobile service robots are deployed in personal or sensitive environments. However, many robotic downstream tasks require the use of cameras, which may raise privacy risks. To better understand user perceptions of privacy in relation to visual data, we conducted a user study investigating how different image modalities and image resolutions affect users' privacy concerns. The results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32 resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalist imitation learning policies trained on large datasets show great promise for solving diverse manipulation tasks. However, to ensure generalization to different conditions, policies need to be trained with data collected across a large set of environmental factor variations (e.g., camera pose, table height, distractors) $-$ a prohibitively expensive undertaking, if done exhaustively. We introduce a principled method for deciding what data to collect and how much to collect for each factor by constructing factored scaling curves (FSC), which quantify how policy performance varies as data scales along individual or paired factors. These curves enable targeted data acquisition for the most influential factor combinations within a given budget. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, across both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, and show that it boosts success rates in real-world tasks in new environments by up to 26% over existing data-collection strategies. We further demonstrate how factored scaling curves can effectively guide data collection using an offline metric, without requiring real-world evaluation at scale.

  Safety, reliability, and user trust are crucial in human-robot interaction (HRI) where the robots must address hazards in real-time. This study presents hazard driven low-level control strategies implemented in robot-assisted dressing (RAD) scenarios where hazards like garment snags and user discomfort in real-time can affect task performance and user safety. The proposed control mechanisms include: (1) Garment Snagging Control Strategy, which detects excessive forces and either seeks user intervention via a chatbot or autonomously adjusts its trajectory, and (2) User Discomfort/Pain Mitigation Strategy, which dynamically reduces velocity based on user feedback and aborts the task if necessary. We used physical dressing trials in order to evaluate these control strategies. Results confirm that integrating force monitoring with user feedback improves safety and task continuity. The findings emphasise the need for hybrid approaches that balance autonomous intervention, user involvement, and controlled task termination, supported by bi-directional interaction and real-time user-driven adaptability, paving the way for more responsive and personalised HRI systems.

  Radar-based odometry is a popular solution for ego-motion estimation in conditions where other exteroceptive sensors may degrade, whether due to poor lighting or challenging weather conditions; however, scanning radars have the downside of relatively lower sampling rate and spatial resolution. In this work, we present FD-RIO, a method to alleviate this problem by fusing noisy, drift-prone, but high-frequency IMU data with dense radar scans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to fuse dense scanning radar odometry with IMU using a Kalman filter. We evaluate our methods using two publicly available datasets and report accuracies using standard KITTI evaluation metrics, in addition to ablation tests and runtime analysis. Our phase correlation -based approach is compact, intuitive, and is designed to be a practical solution deployable on a realistic hardware setup of a mobile platform. Despite its simplicity, FD-RIO is on par with other state-of-the-art methods and outperforms in some test sequences.

  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained popularity in various fields such as agriculture, emergency response, and search and rescue operations. UAV networks are susceptible to several security threats, such as wormhole, jamming, spoofing, and false data injection. Time Delay Attack (TDA) is a unique attack in which malicious UAVs intentionally delay packet forwarding, posing significant threats, especially in time-sensitive applications. It is challenging to distinguish malicious delay from benign network delay due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks, intermittent wireless connectivity, or the Store-Carry-Forward (SCF) mechanism during multi-hop communication. Some existing works propose machine learning-based centralized approaches to detect TDA, which are computationally intensive and have large message overheads. This paper proposes a novel approach DATAMUt, where the temporal dynamics of the network are represented by a weighted time-window graph (TWiG), and then two deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are presented to detect TDA when UAVs have global and local network knowledge. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms have reduced message overhead by a factor of five and twelve in global and local knowledge, respectively, compared to existing approaches. Additionally, our approaches achieve approximately 860 and 1050 times less execution time in global and local knowledge, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.

  [...] With the TelePhysicalOperation interface, the user can teleoperate the different capabilities of a robot (e.g., single/double arm manipulation, wheel/leg locomotion) by applying virtual forces on selected robot body parts. This approach emulates the intuitiveness of physical human-robot interaction, but at the same time it permits to teleoperate the robot from a safe distance, in a way that resembles a "Marionette" interface. The system is further enhanced with wearable haptic feedback functions to align better with the "Marionette" metaphor, and a user study has been conducted to validate its efficacy with and without the haptic channel enabled. Considering the importance of robot independence, the TelePhysicalOperation interface incorporates autonomy modules to face, for example, the teleoperation of dual-arm mobile base robots for bimanual object grasping and transportation tasks.With the laser-guided interface, the user can indicate points of interest to the robot through the utilization of a simple but effective laser emitter device. With a neural network-based vision system, the robot tracks the laser projection in real time, allowing the user to indicate not only fixed goals, like objects, but also paths to follow. With the implemented autonomous behavior, a mobile manipulator employs its locomanipulation abilities to follow the indicated goals. The behavior is modeled using Behavior Trees, exploiting their reactivity to promptly respond to changes in goal positions, and their modularity to adapt the motion planning to the task needs. The proposed laser interface has also been employed in an assistive scenario. In this case, users with upper limbs impairments can control an assistive manipulator by directing a head-worn laser emitter to the point of interests, to collaboratively address activities of everyday life.

  The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.

  Manipulating clothes is challenging due to their complex dynamics, high deformability, and frequent self-occlusions. Garments exhibit a nearly infinite number of configurations, making explicit state representations difficult to define. In this paper, we analyze BiFold, a model that predicts language-conditioned pick-and-place actions from visual observations, while implicitly encoding garment state through end-to-end learning. To address scenarios such as crumpled garments or recovery from failed manipulations, BiFold leverages temporal context to improve state estimation. We examine the internal representations of the model and present evidence that its fine-tuning and temporal context enable effective alignment between text and image regions, as well as temporal consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we present a reliable, scalable, time deterministic, model-free procedure to tune swarms of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) using basic sensory data. Two approaches to taking advantage of parallel tuning are presented. First, the tuning with averaging of the results on the basis of performance indices reported from the swarm with identical gains to decrease the negative effect of the noise in the measurements. Second, the tuning with parallel testing of varying set of gains across the swarm to reduce the tuning time. The presented methods were evaluated both in simulation and real-world experiments. The achieved results show the ability of the proposed approach to improve the results of the tuning while decreasing the tuning time, ensuring at the same time a reliable tuning mechanism.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visuotactile sensing offers rich contact information that can help mitigate performance bottlenecks in imitation learning, particularly under vision-limited conditions, such as ambiguous visual cues or occlusions. Effectively fusing visual and visuotactile modalities, however, presents ongoing challenges. We introduce GelFusion, a framework designed to enhance policies by integrating visuotactile feedback, specifically from high-resolution GelSight sensors. GelFusion using a vision-dominated cross-attention fusion mechanism incorporates visuotactile information into policy learning. To better provide rich contact information, the framework's core component is our dual-channel visuotactile feature representation, simultaneously leveraging both texture-geometric and dynamic interaction features. We evaluated GelFusion on three contact-rich tasks: surface wiping, peg insertion, and fragile object pick-and-place. Outperforming baselines, GelFusion shows the value of its structure in improving the success rate of policy learning.

  Tracking a target person from robot-egocentric views is crucial for developing autonomous robots that provide continuous personalized assistance or collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied AI. However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  [...] Specifically, the problem addressed is an assembly one known as the peg-in-hole task. In this case, two autonomous manipulators must carry cooperatively (at kinematic level) a peg and must insert it into an hole fixed in the environment. Even if the peg-in-hole is a well-known problem, there are no specific studies related to the use of two different autonomous manipulators, especially in underwater scenarios. Among all the possible investigations towards the problem, this work focuses mainly on the kinematic control of the robots. The methods used are part of the Task Priority Inverse Kinematics (TPIK) approach, with a cooperation scheme that permits to exchange as less information as possible between the agents (that is really important being water a big impediment for communication). A force-torque sensor is exploited at kinematic level to help the insertion phase. The results show how the TPIK and the chosen cooperation scheme can be used for the stated problem. The simulated experiments done consider little errors in the hole's pose, that still permit to insert the peg but with a lot of frictions and possible stucks. It is shown how can be possible to improve (thanks to the data provided by the force-torque sensor) the insertion phase performed by the two manipulators in presence of these errors. [...]

  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great potential in general robotic decision-making tasks via imitation learning. However, the variable quality of training data often constrains the performance of these models. On the other hand, offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at learning robust policy models from mixed-quality data. In this paper, we introduce Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end VLA model that integrates the RL principle of maximizing cumulative reward. ReinboT achieves a deeper understanding of the data quality distribution by predicting dense returns that capture the nuances of manipulation tasks. The dense return prediction capability enables the robot to generate more robust decision-making actions, oriented towards maximizing future benefits. Extensive experiments show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset and exhibits superior few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous racing presents unique challenges due to its non-linear dynamics, the high speed involved, and the critical need for real-time decision-making under dynamic and unpredictable conditions. Most traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches rely on extensive simulation-based pre-training, which faces crucial challenges in transfer effectively to real-world environments. This paper introduces a robust on-board RL framework for autonomous racing, designed to eliminate the dependency on simulation-based pre-training enabling direct real-world adaptation. The proposed system introduces a refined Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, leveraging a residual RL structure to enhance classical controllers in real-time by integrating multi-step Temporal-Difference (TD) learning, an asynchronous training pipeline, and Heuristic Delayed Reward Adjustment (HDRA) to improve sample efficiency and training stability. The framework is validated through extensive experiments on the F1TENTH racing platform, where the residual RL controller consistently outperforms the baseline controllers and achieves up to an 11.5 % reduction in lap times compared to the State-of-the-Art (SotA) with only 20 min of training. Additionally, an End-to-End (E2E) RL controller trained without a baseline controller surpasses the previous best results with sustained on-track learning. These findings position the framework as a robust solution for high-performance autonomous racing and a promising direction for other real-time, dynamic autonomous systems.

  Manual pruning is labor intensive and represents up to 25% of annual labor costs in fruit production, notably in apple orchards and vineyards where operational challenges and cost constraints limit the adoption of large-scale machinery. In response, a growing body of research is investigating compact, flexible robotic platforms capable of precise pruning in varied terrains, particularly where traditional mechanization falls short.This paper reviews recent advances in autonomous robotic pruning for orchards and vineyards, addressing a critical need in precision agriculture. Our review examines literature published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on innovative contributions across key system components. Special attention is given to recent developments in machine vision, perception, plant skeletonization, and control strategies, areas that have experienced significant influence from advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The analysis situates these technological trends within broader agricultural challenges, including rising labor costs, a decline in the number of young farmers, and the diverse pruning requirements of different fruit species such as apple, grapevine, and cherry trees.By comparing various robotic architectures and methodologies, this survey not only highlights the progress made toward autonomous pruning but also identifies critical open challenges and future research directions. The findings underscore the potential of robotic systems to bridge the gap between manual and mechanized operations, paving the way for more efficient, sustainable, and precise agricultural practices.

Existing large-scale datasets, especially autonomous vehicle datasets, focus primarily on supervised perception, planning, and motion forecasting tasks. Our work enables multi-modal, data-driven methods by including all sensor inputs and the outputs from the software stack, along with semantic metadata and ground truth information. The dataset encompasses 4 years of data, currently comprising over 13 hours and 32TB, collected on autonomous racing vehicle platforms. This data spans 6 diverse racing environments, including high-speed oval courses, for single and multi-agent algorithm evaluation in feature-sparse scenarios, as well as high-speed road courses with high longitudinal and lateral accelerations and tight, GPS-denied environments. It captures highly dynamic states, such as 63 m/s crashes, loss of tire traction, and operation at the limit of stability. By offering a large breadth of cross-modal and dynamic data, the BETTY dataset enables the training and testing of full autonomy stack pipelines, pushing the performance of all algorithms to the limits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL) trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning. Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical diffusion baselines.

  Robotic grasping is a fundamental skill across all domains of robot applications. There is a large body of research for grasping objects in table-top scenarios, where finding suitable grasps is the main challenge. In this work, we are interested in scenarios where the objects are in confined spaces and hence particularly difficult to reach. Planning how the robot approaches the object becomes a major part of the challenge, giving rise to methods for joint grasp and motion planning. The framework proposed in this paper provides 20 benchmark scenarios with systematically increasing difficulty, realistic objects with precomputed grasp annotations, and tools to create and share more scenarios. We further provide two baseline planners and evaluate them on the scenarios, demonstrating that the proposed difficulty levels indeed offer a meaningful progression. We invite the research community to build upon this framework by making all components publicly available as open source.

  We present UAV-CodeAgents, a scalable multi-agent framework for autonomous UAV mission generation, built on large language and vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs). The system leverages the ReAct (Reason + Act) paradigm to interpret satellite imagery, ground high-level natural language instructions, and collaboratively generate UAV trajectories with minimal human supervision. A core component is a vision-grounded, pixel-pointing mechanism that enables precise localization of semantic targets on aerial maps. To support real-time adaptability, we introduce a reactive thinking loop, allowing agents to iteratively reflect on observations, revise mission goals, and coordinate dynamically in evolving environments.UAV-CodeAgents is evaluated on large-scale mission scenarios involving industrial and environmental fire detection. Our results show that a lower decoding temperature (0.5) yields higher planning reliability and reduced execution time, with an average mission creation time of 96.96 seconds and a success rate of 93%. We further fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B on 9,000 annotated satellite images, achieving strong spatial grounding across diverse visual categories. To foster reproducibility and future research, we will release the full codebase and a novel benchmark dataset for vision-language-based UAV planning.

  Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Si introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

  Human drivers naturally possess the ability to perceive driving scenarios, predict potential hazards, and react instinctively due to their spatial and causal intelligence, which allows them to perceive, understand, predict, and interact with the 3D world both spatially and temporally. Autonomous vehicles, however, lack these capabilities, leading to challenges in effectively managing perception-related Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) risks, particularly in complex and unpredictable driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose an approach that fine-tunes multimodal language models (MLLMs) on a customized dataset specifically designed to capture perception-related SOTIF scenarios. Model benchmarking demonstrates that this tailored dataset enables the models to better understand and respond to these complex driving situations. Additionally, in real-world case studies, the proposed method correctly handles challenging scenarios that even human drivers may find difficult. Real-time performance tests further indicate the potential for the models to operate efficiently in live driving environments. This approach, along with the dataset generation pipeline, shows significant promise for improving the identification, cognition, prediction, and reaction to SOTIF-related risks in autonomous driving systems.

  Perception is a core capability of automated vehicles and has been significantly advanced through modern sensor technologies and artificial intelligence. However, perception systems still face challenges in complex real-world scenarios. To improve robustness against various external factors, multi-sensor fusion techniques are essential, combining the strengths of different sensor modalities. With recent developments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X communication, sensor fusion can now extend beyond a single vehicle to a cooperative multi-agent system involving Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV) and intelligent infrastructure. This paper presents VALISENS, an innovative multi-sensor system distributed across multiple agents. It integrates onboard and roadside LiDARs, radars, thermal cameras, and RGB cameras to enhance situational awareness and support cooperative automated driving. The thermal camera adds critical redundancy for perceiving Vulnerable Road User (VRU), while fusion with roadside sensors mitigates visual occlusions and extends the perception range beyond the limits of individual vehicles. We introduce the corresponding perception module built on this sensor system, which includes object detection, tracking, motion forecasting, and high-level data fusion. The proposed system demonstrates the potential of cooperative perception in real-world test environments and lays the groundwork for future Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) applications.

  This paper introduces an innovative approach for the autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using only a front-facing monocular camera, therefore obviating the requirement for depth estimation cameras. Drawing on the inherent human estimating process, the proposed method reframes the landing task as an optimization problem. The UAV employs variations in the visual characteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad, where the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating both altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to approximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to ascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is assessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust and accurate autonomous landing without dependence on complex sensor setups. This research contributes to the advancement of cost-effective and efficient UAV landing solutions, paving the way for wider applicability across various fields.

  Traditional target tracking pipelines including detection, mapping, navigation, and control are comprehensive but introduce high latency, limitting the agility of quadrotors. On the contrary, we follow the design principle of "less is more", striving to simplify the process while maintaining effectiveness. In this work, we propose an end-to-end agile tracking and navigation framework for quadrotors that directly maps the sensory observations to control commands. Importantly, leveraging the multimodal nature of navigation and detection tasks, our network maintains interpretability by explicitly integrating the independent modules of the traditional pipeline, rather than a crude action regression. In detail, we adopt a set of motion primitives as anchors to cover the searching space regarding the feasible region and potential target. Then we reformulate the trajectory optimization as regression of primitive offsets and associated costs considering the safety, smoothness, and other metrics. For tracking task, the trajectories are expected to approach the target and additional objectness scores are predicted. Subsequently, the predictions, after compensation for the estimated lumped disturbance, are transformed into thrust and attitude as control commands for swift response. During training, we seamlessly integrate traditional motion planning with deep learning by directly back-propagating the gradients of trajectory costs to the network, eliminating the need for expert demonstration in imitation learning and providing more direct guidance than reinforcement learning. Finally, we deploy the algorithm on a compact quadrotor and conduct real-world validations in both forest and building environments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control. Project Website:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous driving has made significant strides through data-driven techniques, achieving robust performance in standardized tasks. However, existing methods frequently overlook user-specific preferences, offering limited scope for interaction and adaptation with users. To address these challenges, we propose a "fast-slow" decision-making framework that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) for high-level instruction parsing with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for low-level real-time decision. In this dual system, the LLM operates as the "slow" module, translating user directives into structured guidance, while the RL agent functions as the "fast" module, making time-critical maneuvers under stringent latency constraints. By decoupling high-level decision making from rapid control, our framework enables personalized user-centric operation while maintaining robust safety margins. Experimental evaluations across various driving scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed architecture not only reduces collision rates but also aligns driving behaviors more closely with user preferences, thereby achieving a human-centric mode. By integrating user guidance at the decision level and refining it with real-time control, our framework bridges the gap between individual passenger needs and the rigor required for safe, reliable driving in complex traffic environments.

  Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction. Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues. However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks? To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP), which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward planning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary, task-oriented grasping of specific functional parts, particularly with dual arms, remains a key challenge, as current Vision-Language Models (VLMs), while enhancing task understanding, often struggle with precise grasp generation within defined constraints and effective dual-arm coordination. We innovatively propose UniDiffGrasp, a unified framework integrating VLM reasoning with guided part diffusion to address these limitations. UniDiffGrasp leverages a VLM to interpret user input and identify semantic targets (object, part(s), mode), which are then grounded via open-vocabulary segmentation. Critically, the identified parts directly provide geometric constraints for a Constrained Grasp Diffusion Field (CGDF) using its Part-Guided Diffusion, enabling efficient, high-quality 6-DoF grasps without retraining. For dual-arm tasks, UniDiffGrasp defines distinct target regions, applies part-guided diffusion per arm, and selects stable cooperative grasps. Through extensive real-world deployment, UniDiffGrasp achieves grasp success rates of 0.876 in single-arm and 0.767 in dual-arm scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its capability to enable precise and coordinated open-vocabulary grasping in complex real-world scenarios.

  Motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics that involves generating feasible trajectories for a robot to follow. Recent advances in parallel computing, particularly through CPU and GPU architectures, have significantly reduced planning times to the order of milliseconds. However, constrained motion planning especially using sampling based methods on GPUs remains underexplored. Prior work such as pRRTC leverages a tracking compiler with a CUDA backend to accelerate forward kinematics and collision checking. While effective in simple settings, their approach struggles with increased complexity in robot models or environments. In this paper, we propose a novel GPU based framework utilizing NVRTC for runtime compilation, enabling efficient handling of high complexity scenarios and supporting constrained motion planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanoid loco-manipulation holds transformative potential for daily service and industrial tasks, yet achieving precise, robust whole-body control with 3D end-effector force interaction remains a major challenge. Prior approaches are often limited to lightweight tasks or quadrupedal/wheeled platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose FALCON, a dual-agent reinforcement-learning-based framework for robust force-adaptive humanoid loco-manipulation. FALCON decomposes whole-body control into two specialized agents: (1) a lower-body agent ensuring stable locomotion under external force disturbances, and (2) an upper-body agent precisely tracking end-effector positions with implicit adaptive force compensation. These two agents are jointly trained in simulation with a force curriculum that progressively escalates the magnitude of external force exerted on the end effector while respecting torque limits. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the baselines, FALCON achieves 2x more accurate upper-body joint tracking, while maintaining robust locomotion under force disturbances and achieving faster training convergence. Moreover, FALCON enables policy training without embodiment-specific reward or curriculum tuning. Using the same training setup, we obtain policies that are deployed across multiple humanoids, enabling forceful loco-manipulation tasks such as transporting payloads (0-20N force), cart-pulling (0-100N), and door-opening (0-40N) in the real world.

  Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot systems. However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous mobile robots operating in novel environments depend critically on accurate state estimation, often utilizing visual and inertial measurements. Recent work has shown that an invariant formulation of the extended Kalman filter improves the convergence and robustness of visual-inertial odometry by utilizing the Lie group structure of a robot's position, velocity, and orientation states. However, inertial sensors also require measurement bias estimation, yet introducing the bias in the filter state breaks the Lie group symmetry. In this paper, we design a neural network to predict the bias of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) from a sequence of previous IMU measurements. This allows us to use an invariant filter for visual inertial odometry, relying on the learned bias prediction rather than introducing the bias in the filter state. We demonstrate that an invariant multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) with learned bias predictions achieves robust visual-inertial odometry in real experiments, even when visual information is unavailable for extended periods and the system needs to rely solely on IMU measurements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

  Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been increasingly integrated into object navigation tasks for their rich prior knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. However, applying VLMs to navigation poses two key challenges: effectively representing complex environment information and determining \textit{when and how} to query VLMs. Insufficient environment understanding and over-reliance on VLMs (e.g. querying at every step) can lead to unnecessary backtracking and reduced navigation efficiency, especially in continuous environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that constructs a multi-layer representation of the environment during navigation. This representation consists of viewpoint, object nodes, and room nodes. Viewpoints and object nodes facilitate intra-room exploration and accurate target localization, while room nodes support efficient inter-room planning. Building on this representation, we propose a novel two-stage navigation policy, integrating high-level planning guided by VLM reasoning with low-level VLM-assisted exploration to efficiently locate a goal object. We evaluated our approach on three simulated benchmarks (HM3D, RoboTHOR, and MP3D), and achieved state-of-the-art performance on both the success rate ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 7.1\%$) and navigation efficiency ($\mathord{\uparrow}\, 12.5\%$). We further validate our method on a real robot platform, demonstrating strong robustness across 15 object navigation tasks in 10 different indoor environments.

  Safe and efficient motion planning is of fundamental importance for autonomous vehicles. This paper investigates motion planning based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) over a neural network vehicle model. We aim to overcome the high computational costs that arise in NMPC of the neural network model due to the highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization. In a departure from numerical optimization solutions, we reformulate the problem of NMPC-based motion planning as a Bayesian estimation problem, which seeks to infer optimal planning decisions from planning objectives. Then, we use a sequential ensemble Kalman smoother to accomplish the estimation task, exploiting its high computational efficiency for complex nonlinear systems. The simulation results show an improvement in computational speed by orders of magnitude, indicating the potential of the proposed approach for practical motion planning.

  This study presents an advanced multi-view drone swarm imaging system for the three-dimensional characterization of smoke plume dispersion dynamics. The system comprises a manager drone and four worker drones, each equipped with high-resolution cameras and precise GPS modules. The manager drone uses image feedback to autonomously detect and position itself above the plume, then commands the worker drones to orbit the area in a synchronized circular flight pattern, capturing multi-angle images. The camera poses of these images are first estimated, then the images are grouped in batches and processed using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to generate high-resolution 3D reconstructions of plume dynamics over time. Field tests demonstrated the ability of the system to capture critical plume characteristics including volume dynamics, wind-driven directional shifts, and lofting behavior at a temporal resolution of about 1 s. The 3D reconstructions generated by this system provide unique field data for enhancing the predictive models of smoke plume dispersion and fire spread. Broadly, the drone swarm system offers a versatile platform for high resolution measurements of pollutant emissions and transport in wildfires, volcanic eruptions, prescribed burns, and industrial processes, ultimately supporting more effective fire control decisions and mitigating wildfire risks.

  Embodied AI research has traditionally emphasized performance metrics such as success rate and cumulative reward, overlooking critical robustness and safety considerations that emerge during real-world deployment. In actual environments, agents continuously encounter unpredicted situations and distribution shifts, causing seemingly reliable policies to experience catastrophic failures, particularly in manipulation tasks. To address this gap, we introduce four novel safety-centric metrics that quantify an agent's resilience to environmental perturbations. Building on these metrics, we present Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Robust Manipulation (ACORN), a plug-and-play algorithm that enhances policy robustness without sacrificing performance. ACORN leverages contrastive learning to simultaneously align trajectories with expert demonstrations while diverging from potentially unsafe behaviors. Our approach efficiently generates informative negative samples through structured Gaussian noise injection, employing a double perturbation technique that maintains sample diversity while minimizing computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments across diverse manipulation environments validate ACORN's effectiveness, yielding improvements of up to 23% in safety metrics under disturbance compared to baseline methods. These findings underscore ACORN's significant potential for enabling reliable deployment of embodied agents in safety-critical real-world applications.

  This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking (fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation and real environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, demonstrating strong capabilities in problem comprehension and reasoning. Inspired by these developments, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs as decentralized decision-makers for multi-robot formation control. However, prior studies reveal that directly applying LLMs to such tasks often leads to unstable and inconsistent behaviors, where robots may collapse to the centroid of their positions or diverge entirely due to hallucinated reasoning, logical inconsistencies, and limited coordination awareness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an influence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot independently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own LLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized consensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots. This process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation in a fully decentralized manner. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulations involving both state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (e.g., o3-mini, Claude 3.5) and open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1-405b, Qwen-Max, DeepSeek-R1). The results show notable improvements in stability, convergence, and adaptability over previous LLM-based methods. We further validate our framework on a physical team of Crazyflie drones, demonstrating its practical viability and effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

  Robot autonomy in unknown, GPS-denied, and complex underground environments requires real-time, robust, and accurate onboard pose estimation and mapping for reliable operations. This becomes particularly challenging in perception-degraded subterranean conditions under harsh environmental factors, including darkness, dust, and geometrically self-similar structures. This paper details CompSLAM, a highly resilient and hierarchical multi-modal localization and mapping framework designed to address these challenges. Its flexible architecture achieves resilience through redundancy by leveraging the complementary nature of pose estimates derived from diverse sensor modalities. Developed during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, CompSLAM was successfully deployed on all aerial, legged, and wheeled robots of Team Cerberus during their competition-winning final run. Furthermore, it has proven to be a reliable odometry and mapping solution in various subsequent projects, with extensions enabling multi-robot map sharing for marsupial robotic deployments and collaborative mapping. This paper also introduces a comprehensive dataset acquired by a manually teleoperated quadrupedal robot, covering a significant portion of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals course. This dataset evaluates CompSLAM's robustness to sensor degradations as the robot traverses 740 meters in an environment characterized by highly variable geometries and demanding lighting conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning offers a pathway for robots to perform repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on more engaging and meaningful activities. However, challenges arise from the need for extensive demonstrations and the disparity between training and real-world environments. This paper focuses on contact-rich tasks like wiping with soft and deformable objects, requiring adaptive force control to handle variations in wiping surface height and the sponge's physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates real-time force-torque (FT) feedback with pre-trained object representations. This approach allows robots to dynamically adjust to previously unseen changes in surface heights and sponges' physical properties. In real-world experiments, our method achieved 96% accuracy in applying reference forces, significantly outperforming the previous method that lacked an FT feedback loop, which only achieved 4% accuracy. To evaluate the adaptability of our approach, we conducted experiments under different conditions from the training setup, involving 40 scenarios using 10 sponges with varying physical properties and 4 types of wiping surface heights, demonstrating significant improvements in the robot's adaptability by analyzing force trajectories.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous landing is essential for drones deployed in emergency deliveries, post-disaster response, and other large-scale missions. By enabling self-docking on charging platforms, it facilitates continuous operation and significantly extends mission endurance. However, traditional approaches often fall short in dynamic, unstructured environments due to limited semantic awareness and reliance on fixed, context-insensitive safety margins. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates large language model (LLMs) with model predictive control (MPC). Our approach begins with a vision-language encoder (VLE) (e.g., BLIP), which transforms real-time images into concise textual scene descriptions. These descriptions are processed by a lightweight LLM (e.g., Qwen 2.5 1.5B or LLaMA 3.2 1B) equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to classify scene elements and infer context-aware safety buffers, such as 3 meters for pedestrians and 5 meters for vehicles. The resulting semantic flags and unsafe regions are then fed into an MPC module, enabling real-time trajectory replanning that avoids collisions while maintaining high landing precision. We validate our framework in the ROS-Gazebo simulator, where it consistently outperforms conventional vision-based MPC baselines. Our results show a significant reduction in near-miss incidents with dynamic obstacles, while preserving accurate landings in cluttered environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As robots become more generalized and deployed in diverse environments, they must interact with complex objects, many with multiple independent joints or degrees of freedom (DoF) requiring precise control. A common strategy is object modeling, where compact state-space models are learned from real-world observations and paired with classical planning. However, existing methods often rely on prior knowledge or focus on single-DoF objects, limiting their applicability. They also fail to handle occluded joints and ignore the manipulation sequences needed to access them. We address this by learning object models from human demonstrations. We introduce Object Kinematic Sequence Machines (OKSMs), a novel representation capturing both kinematic constraints and manipulation order for multi-DoF objects. To estimate these models from point cloud data, we present Pokenet, a deep neural network trained on human demonstrations. We validate our approach on 8,000 simulated and 1,600 real-world annotated samples. Pokenet improves joint axis and state estimation by over 20 percent on real-world data compared to prior methods. Finally, we demonstrate OKSMs on a Sawyer robot using inverse kinematics-based planning to manipulate multi-DoF objects.

  _Yuki Kadokawa, Jonas Frey, Takahiro Miki, Takamitsu Matsubara, Marco Hutter_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) enables policy learning through simple queries comparing trajectories from a single policy. While human responses to these queries make it possible to learn policies aligned with human preferences, PbRL suffers from low query efficiency, as policy bias limits trajectory diversity and reduces the number of discriminable queries available for learning preferences. This paper identifies preference discriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which trajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving query efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single policy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple policies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias. We propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability with trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains new policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator that learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized sampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes the preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the discovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies. Experiments in simulated and real-world legged robot environments demonstrate that DAPPER outperforms previous methods in query efficiency, particularly under challenging preference discriminability conditions.

However, two major challenges limit their accessibility: the rarity of SCEs and the presence of sensitive privacy information in the data. The Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS), the largest NDS to date, collected millions of hours of multimodal, high-resolution, high-frequency driving data from thousands of participants, capturing thousands of SCEs. While this dataset is invaluable for safety research, privacy concerns and data use restrictions significantly limit public access to the raw data. To address these challenges, we introduce SynSHRP2, a publicly available, synthetic, multimodal driving dataset containing over 1874 crashes and 6924 near-crashes derived from the SHRP 2 NDS. The dataset features de-identified keyframes generated using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, ensuring the preservation of critical safety-related information while eliminating personally identifiable data. Additionally, SynSHRP2 includes detailed annotations on SCE type, environmental and traffic conditions, and time-series kinematic data spanning 5 seconds before and during each event. Synchronized keyframes and narrative descriptions further enhance its usability. This paper presents two benchmarks for event attribute classification and scene understanding, demonstrating the potential applications of SynSHRP2 in advancing safety research and automated driving system development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lane determination and lane sequence determination are important components for many Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications. Lane determination has been solved using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) among other methods. The existing HMM literature for lane sequence determination uses empirical definitions with user-modified parameters to calculate HMM probabilities. The probability definitions in the literature can cause breaks in the HMM due to the inability to directly calculate probabilities of off-road positions, requiring post-processing of data. This paper develops a time-varying HMM using the physical properties of the roadway and vehicle, and the stochastic properties of the sensors. This approach yields emission and transition probability models conditioned on the sensor data without parameter tuning. It also accounts for the probability that the vehicle is not in any roadway lane (e.g., on the shoulder or making a U-turn), which eliminates the need for post-processing to deal with breaks in the HMM processing. This approach requires adapting the Viterbi algorithm and the HMM to be conditioned on the sensor data, which are then used to generate the most-likely sequence of lanes the vehicle has traveled. The proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 95.9%. Compared to the existing literature, this provides an average increase of 2.25% by implementing the proposed transition probability and an average increase of 5.1% by implementing both the proposed transition and emission probabilities.

  One of the central challenges preventing robots from acquiring complex manipulation skills is the prohibitive cost of collecting large-scale robot demonstrations. In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics. Our source code is available here:this https URL

  The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent imitation learning policies, often framed as time series prediction tasks, directly map robotic observations-such as high-dimensional visual data and proprioception-into the action space. While time series prediction primarily relies on spatial domain modeling, the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction may lead to neglecting the inherent temporal information embedded within action sequences. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of the frequency domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features from the frequency domain using the SE2MD (Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the frequency domain and increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Frequency-Domain Filter (LFDF) after each frequency decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods by over 10% on four challenging robotic arm tasks, while maintaining a comparable parameter count. In long-range settings, its performance declines more slowly as task volume increases. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  To enhance pediatric exosuit design, it is crucial to assess the actuator-generated forces. This work evaluates the contact forces exerted by soft fabric-based pneumatic actuators in an upper extremity pediatric exosuit. Two actuators were examined: a single-cell bidirectional actuator for shoulder abduction/adduction and a bellow-type actuator for elbow extension/flexion. Experiments assessed the impact of actuator anchoring points and the adjacent joint's angle on exerted forces and actuated joint range of motion (ROM). These were measured via load cells and encoders integrated into a custom infant-scale engineered apparatus with two degrees of freedom (two revolute joints). For the shoulder actuator, results show that anchoring it further from the shoulder joint center while the elbow is flexed at $90^\circ$ yields the highest ROM while minimizing the peak force exerted on the body. For the elbow actuator, anchoring it symmetrically while the shoulder joint is at $0^\circ$ optimizes actuator performance. These findings contribute a key step toward co-optimizing the considered exosuit design for functionality and wearability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A robot that learns from demonstrations should not just imitate what it sees -- it should understand the high-level concepts that are being demonstrated and generalize them to new tasks. Bilevel planning is a hierarchical model-based approach where predicates (relational state abstractions) can be leveraged to achieve compositional generalization. However, previous bilevel planning approaches depend on predicates that are either hand-engineered or restricted to very simple forms, limiting their scalability to sophisticated, high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we present IVNTR, the first bilevel planning approach capable of learning neural predicates directly from demonstrations. Our key innovation is a neuro-symbolic bilevel learning framework that mirrors the structure of bilevel planning. In IVNTR, symbolic learning of the predicate "effects" and neural learning of the predicate "functions" alternate, with each providing guidance for the other. We evaluate IVNTR in six diverse robot planning domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in abstracting various continuous and high-dimensional states. While most existing approaches struggle to generalize (with <35% success rate), our IVNTR achieves an average of 77% success rate on unseen tasks. Additionally, we showcase IVNTR on a mobile manipulator, where it learns to perform real-world mobile manipulation tasks and generalizes to unseen test scenarios that feature new objects, new states, and longer task horizons. Our findings underscore the promise of learning and planning with abstractions as a path towards high-level generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

  _Brian Acosta, Michael Posa_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traversing rough terrain requires dynamic bipeds to stabilize themselves through foot placement without stepping in unsafe areas. Planning these footsteps online is challenging given non-convexity of the safe terrain, and imperfect perception and state estimation. This paper addresses these challenges with a full-stack perception and control system for achieving underactuated walking on discontinuous terrain. First, we develop model-predictive footstep control (MPFC), a single mixed-integer quadratic program which assumes a convex polygon terrain decomposition to optimize over discrete foothold choice, footstep position, ankle torque, template dynamics, and footstep timing at over 100 Hz. We then propose a novel approach for generating convex polygon terrain decompositions online. Our perception stack decouples safe-terrain classification from fitting planar polygons, generating a temporally consistent terrain segmentation in real time using a single CPU thread. We demonstrate the performance of our perception and control stack through outdoor experiments with the underactuated biped Cassie, achieving state of the art perceptive bipedal walking on discontinuous terrain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Configuring a prosthetic leg is an integral part of the fitting process, but the personalization of a multi-modal powered knee-ankle prosthesis is often too complex to realize in a clinical environment. This paper develops both the technical means to individualize a hybrid kinematic-impedance controller for variable-incline walking and sit-stand transitions, and an intuitive Clinical Tuning Interface (CTI) that allows prosthetists to directly modify the controller behavior. Utilizing an established method for predicting kinematic gait individuality alongside a new parallel approach for kinetic individuality, we personalize continuous-phase/task models of joint impedance (during stance) and kinematics (during swing) using tuned characteristics exclusively from level-ground walking. To take advantage of this method, we developed a CTI that translates common clinical tuning parameters into model adjustments for the walking and sit-stand controllers. We then conducted a case study where a prosthetist iteratively tuned the powered prosthesis to an above-knee amputee participant in a simulated clinical session involving sit-stand transitions and level walking, from which incline/decline walking features were automatically calibrated. The prosthetist fully tuned the multi-activity prosthesis controller in under 20 min. Each iteration of tuning (i.e., observation, parameter adjustment, and model reprocessing) took 2 min on average for walking and 1 min on average for sit-stand. The tuned behavior changes were appropriately manifested in the commanded prosthesis torques, both at the manually tuned tasks and automatically tuned tasks (inclines). This paper introduces a clinical tuning interface that simplifies the tuning process for multimodal robotic prosthetic legs, reducing the time required from several hours to just 20 min thus improving clinical feasibility.

  Jointly estimating hand and object shape facilitates the grasping task in human-to-robot handovers. However, relying on hand-crafted prior knowledge about the geometric structure of the object fails when generalising to unseen objects, and depth sensors fail to detect transparent objects such as drinking glasses. In this work, we propose a stereo-based method for hand-object reconstruction that combines single-view reconstructions probabilistically to form a coherent stereo reconstruction. We learn 3D shape priors from a large synthetic hand-object dataset to ensure that our method is generalisable, and use RGB inputs to better capture transparent objects. We show that our method reduces the object Chamfer distance compared to existing RGB based hand-object reconstruction methods on single view and stereo settings. We process the reconstructed hand-object shape with a projection-based outlier removal step and use the output to guide a human-to-robot handover pipeline with wide-baseline stereo RGB cameras. Our hand-object reconstruction enables a robot to successfully receive a diverse range of household objects from the human.

  Maritime environmental sensing requires overcoming challenges from complex conditions such as harsh weather, platform perturbations, large dynamic objects, and the requirement for long detection ranges. While cameras and LiDAR are commonly used in ground vehicle navigation, their applicability in maritime settings is limited by range constraints and hardware maintenance issues. Radar sensors, however, offer robust long-range detection capabilities and resilience to physical contamination from weather and saline conditions, making it a powerful sensor for maritime navigation. Among various radar types, X-band radar is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation, providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing operations where near-field detection is critical. To address this shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar, which excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework. Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage, derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of \bl{navigation algorithm} estimation difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation, SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime environments.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Asymmetric Dexterity (AsymDex), a novel and simple reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can efficiently learn a large class of bimanual skills in multi-fingered hands without relying on demonstrations. Two crucial insights enable AsymDex to reduce the observation and action space dimensions and improve sample efficiency. First, true ambidexterity is rare in humans and most of us exhibit strong "handedness". Inspired by this observation, we assign complementary roles to each hand: the facilitating hand repositions and reorients one object, while the dominant hand performs complex manipulations to achieve the desired result (e.g., opening a bottle cap, or pouring liquids). Second, controlling the relative motion between the hands is crucial for coordination and synchronization of the two hands. As such, we design relative observation and action spaces and leverage a relative-pose tracking controller. Further, we propose a two-phase decomposition in which AsymDex can be readily integrated with recent advances in grasp learning to facilitate both the acquisition and manipulation of objects using two hands. Unlike existing RL-based methods for bimanual dexterity with multi-fingered hands, which are either sample inefficient or tailored to a specific task, AsymDex can efficiently learn a wide variety of bimanual skills that exhibit asymmetry. Detailed experiments on seven asymmetric bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks (four simulated and three real-world) reveal that AsymDex consistently outperforms strong baselines that challenge our design choices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a framework for Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) in heterogeneous teams performing long-endurance missions in dynamic scenarios. Given the limited battery of robots, especially for aerial vehicles, we allow for robot recharges and the possibility of fragmenting and/or relaying certain tasks. We also address tasks that must be performed by a coalition of robots in a coordinated manner. Given these features, we introduce a new class of heterogeneous MRTA problems which we analyze theoretically and optimally formulate as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program. We then contribute a heuristic algorithm to compute approximate solutions and integrate it into a mission planning and execution architecture capable of reacting to unexpected events by repairing or recomputing plans online. Our experimental results show the relevance of our newly formulated problem in a realistic use case for inspection with aerial robots. We assess the performance of our heuristic solver in comparison with other variants and with exact optimal solutions in small-scale scenarios. In addition, we evaluate the ability of our replanning framework to repair plans online.

  Teaching robots desired skills in real-world environments remains challenging, especially for non-experts. A key bottleneck is that collecting robotic data often requires expertise or specialized hardware, limiting accessibility and scalability. We posit that natural language offers an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study two aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural language supervision (e.g., "move the arm to the right") and (2) training robot policies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present CLIP-RT, a new vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns language-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts the pretrained CLIP model and learns to predict language-based motion primitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open X-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our framework. In real-world evaluations, CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities in learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming OpenVLA (7B parameters) by 24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B). We further assess CLIP-RT's capabilities in few-shot generalization and collaborative scenarios involving large pretrained models or humans. In simulated environments, CLIP-RT also yields strong performance, achieving a 93.1% average success rate on the LIBERO benchmark with an inference throughput of 163 Hz.

Our system enables users to visualize robot perception outputs such as object detection and segmentation results using a MR device. Therefore, users can inspect failures of perception models using the system on real robots. Moreover, iTeach facilitates real-time, informed data collection and annotation, where users can use hand gesture, eye gaze and voice commands to annotate images collected from robots. The annotated images can be used to fine-tune perception models to improve their accuracy and adaptability. The system continually improves perception models by collecting annotations of failed examples from users. When applied to object detection and unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) tasks, iTeach demonstrates encouraging results in improving pre-trained vision models for these two tasks. These results highlight the potential of MR to make robotic perception systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments. Project page atthis https URL.

  Place recognition plays an important role in achieving robust long-term autonomy. Real-world robots face a wide range of weather conditions (e.g. overcast, heavy rain, and snowing) and most sensors (i.e. camera, LiDAR) essentially functioning within or near-visible electromagnetic waves are sensitive to adverse weather conditions, making reliable localization difficult. In contrast, radar is gaining traction due to long electromagnetic waves, which are less affected by environmental changes and weather independence. In this work, we propose a radar-based lightweight and robust place recognition. We achieve rotational invariance and lightweight by selecting a one-dimensional ring-shaped description and robustness by mitigating the impact of false detection utilizing opposite noise characteristics between free space and feature. In addition, the initial heading can be estimated, which can assist in building a SLAM pipeline that combines odometry and registration, which takes into account onboard computing. The proposed method was tested for rigorous validation across various scenarios (i.e. single session, multi-session, and different weather conditions). In particular, we validate our descriptor achieving reliable place recognition performance through the results of extreme environments that lacked structural information such as an OORD dataset.

  Controlling hands in high-dimensional action space has been a longstanding challenge, yet humans naturally perform dexterous tasks with ease. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the concept of internal model exhibited in human behavior and reconsider dexterous hands as learnable systems. Specifically, we introduce MoDex, a framework that includes a couple of neural networks (NNs) capturing the dynamical characteristics of hands and a bidirectional planning approach, which demonstrates both training and planning efficiency. To show the versatility of MoDex, we further integrate it with an external model to manipulate in-hand objects and a large language model (LLM) to generate various gestures in both simulation and real world. Extensive experiments on different dexterous hands address the data efficiency in learning a new task and the transferability between different tasks.

  Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO) approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.

  Robot co-design, where the morphology of a robot is optimized jointly with a learned policy to solve a specific task, is an emerging area of research. It holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators. Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL algorithm.

  A technique that allows a Formation-Enforcing Control (FEC) derived from graph rigidity theory to interface with a realistic relative localization system onboard lightweight Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology enables reliable real-world deployment of UAVs in tight formations using relative localization systems burdened by non-negligible sensory noise, which is typically not fully taken into account in FEC algorithms. The proposed solution is based on decomposition of the gradient descent-based FEC command into interpretable elements, and then modifying these individually based on the estimated distribution of sensory noise, such that the resulting action limits the probability of the desired formation. The behavior of the system was analyzed and the practicality of the proposed solution was compared to pure gradient-descent in real-world experiments where it presented significantly better performance in terms of oscillations, deviation from the desired state and convergence time.
