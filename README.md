- **[elsciRL: Integrating Language Solutions into Reinforcement Learning Problem Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08705)**  `arXiv:2507.08705`  
  _Philip Osborne, Danilo S. Carvalho, Andr√© Freitas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present elsciRL, an open-source Python library to facilitate the application of language solutions on reinforcement learning problems. We demonstrate the potential of our software by extending the Language Adapter with Self-Completing Instruction framework defined in (Osborne, 2024) with the use of LLMs. Our approach can be re-applied to new applications with minimal setup requirements. We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text input for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete. Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a reinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to accelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to enable new opportunities for scientific discovery.

- **[Introspection of Thought Helps AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08664)**  `arXiv:2507.08664`  
  _Haoran Sun, Shaoning Zeng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end, we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought (INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt. Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM, which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified, with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines. Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification experiments.

- **[Leanabell-Prover-V2: Verifier-integrated Reasoning for Formal Theorem Proving via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08649)**  `arXiv:2507.08649`  
  _Xingguang Ji, Yahui Liu, Qi Wang, Jingyuan Zhang, Yang Yue, Rui Shi, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially, verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors, allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions, together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by 3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set.

- **[Agentic Large Language Models for Conceptual Systems Engineering and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08619)**  `arXiv:2507.08619`  
  _Soheyl Massoudi, Mark Fuge_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction, functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1 70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility, workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes) whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

- **[Large Multi-modal Model Cartographic Map Comprehension for Textual Locality Georeferencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08575)**  `arXiv:2507.08575`  
  _Kalana Wijegunarathna, Kristin Stock, Christopher B. Jones_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps. Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this method into a georeferencing workflow.

- **[A Multi-granularity Concept Sparse Activation and Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Fusion Framework for Rare Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08529)**  `arXiv:2507.08529`  
  _Mingda Zhang, Na Zhao, Jianglong Qin, Guoyu Ye, Ruixiang Tang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.

- **[From Language to Logic: A Bi-Level Framework for Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08501)**  `arXiv:2507.08501`  
  _Keying Yang, Hao Wang, Kai Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages. Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

- **[M2-Reasoning: Empowering MLLMs with Unified General and Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08306)**  `arXiv:2507.08306`  
  _Inclusion AI, Fudong Wang, Jiajia Liu, Jingdong Chen, Jun Zhou, Kaixiang Ji, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

- **[Abductive Computational Systems: Creative Abduction and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08264)**  `arXiv:2507.08264`  
  _Abhinav Sood, Kazjon Grace, Stephen Wan, Cecile Paris_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Abductive reasoning, reasoning for inferring explanations for observations, is often mentioned in scientific, design-related and artistic contexts, but its understanding varies across these domains. This paper reviews how abductive reasoning is discussed in epistemology, science and design, and then analyses how various computational systems use abductive reasoning. Our analysis shows that neither theoretical accounts nor computational implementations of abductive reasoning adequately address generating creative hypotheses. Theoretical frameworks do not provide a straightforward model for generating creative abductive hypotheses, computational systems largely implement syllogistic forms of abductive reasoning. We break down abductive computational systems into components and conclude by identifying specific directions for future research that could advance the state of creative abductive reasoning in computational systems.

- **[Quantum Federated Learning for Multimodal Data: A Modality-Agnostic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08217)**  `arXiv:2507.08217`  
  _Atit Pokharel, Ratun Rahman, Thomas Morris, Dinh C. Nguyen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

- **[Grounding Methods for Neural-Symbolic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08216)**  `arXiv:2507.08216`  
  _Rodrigo Castellano Ontiveros, Francesco Giannini, Marco Gori, Giuseppe Marra, Michelangelo Diligenti_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.

- **[From Curiosity to Competence: How World Models Interact with the Dynamics of Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08210)**  `arXiv:2507.08210`  
  _Fryderyk Mantiuk, Hanqi Zhou, Charley M. Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence (the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration. The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

- **[A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Framework for Agentic AI Defense Against LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08207)**  `arXiv:2507.08207`  
  _Zhengye Han, Quanyan Zhu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

  _Sishi Xiong, Dakai Wang, Yu Zhao, Jie Zhang, Changzai Pan, Haowei He, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The paper presents our system developed for table question answering (TQA). TQA tasks face challenges due to the characteristics of real-world tabular data, such as large size, incomplete column semantics, and entity ambiguity. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM)-powered and programming-based table reasoning framework, named TableReasoner. It models a table using the schema that combines structural and semantic representations, enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table details for query refinement and programming. Furthermore, we integrate the reasoning workflow into an iterative thinking architecture, allowing incremental cycles of thinking, reasoning and reflection. Our system achieves first place in both subtasks of SemEval-2025 Task 8.

- **[Measuring AI Alignment with Human Flourishing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07787)**  `arXiv:2507.07787`  
  _Elizabeth Hilliard, Akshaya Jagadeesh, Alex Cook, Steele Billings, Nicholas Skytland, Alicia Llewellyn, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health, Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention, the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229 objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions, particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

  _Weihao Tan, Changjiu Jiang, Yu Duan, Mingcong Lei, Jiageng Li, Yitian Hong, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified, user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living environments.

- **[Interpreting systems as solving POMDPs: a step towards a formal understanding of agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01619)**  `arXiv:2209.01619`  
  _Martin Biehl, Nathaniel Virgo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Under what circumstances can a system be said to have beliefs and goals, and how do such agency-related features relate to its physical state? Recent work has proposed a notion of interpretation map, a function that maps the state of a system to a probability distribution representing its beliefs about an external world. Such a map is not completely arbitrary, as the beliefs it attributes to the system must evolve over time in a manner that is consistent with Bayes' theorem, and consequently the dynamics of a system constrain its possible interpretations. Here we build on this approach, proposing a notion of interpretation not just in terms of beliefs but in terms of goals and actions. To do this we make use of the existing theory of partially observable Markov processes (POMDPs): we say that a system can be interpreted as a solution to a POMDP if it not only admits an interpretation map describing its beliefs about the hidden state of a POMDP but also takes actions that are optimal according to its belief state. An agent is then a system together with an interpretation of this system as a POMDP solution. Although POMDPs are not the only possible formulation of what it means to have a goal, this nevertheless represents a step towards a more general formal definition of what it means for a system to be an agent.

- **[KV Cache Steering for Inducing Reasoning in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08799)**  `arXiv:2507.08799`  
  _Max Belitsky, Dawid J. Kopiczko, Michael Dorkenwald, M. Jehanzeb Mirza, Cees G. M. Snoek, Yuki M. Asano_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

- **[KG-Attention: Knowledge Graph-Guided Attention at Test-Time via Bidirectional Information Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08704)**  `arXiv:2507.08704`  
  _Songlin Zhai, Guilin Qi, Yuan Meng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism. By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs), a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic. Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3 (81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are available in the supplementary materials.

- **[The Impact of Automatic Speech Transcription on Speaker Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08660)**  `arXiv:2507.08660`  
  _Cristina Aggazzotti, Matthew Wiesner, Elizabeth Allyn Smith, Nicholas Andrews_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g. deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker identity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently, the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the operation of these models in publicly available argument classification databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse datasets such asthis http URLand UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT, Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

  _Benno Uthayasooriyar, Antoine Ly, Franck Vermet, Caio Corro_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DocPolarBERT, a layout-aware BERT model for document understanding that eliminates the need for absolute 2D positional embeddings. We extend self-attention to take into account text block positions in relative polar coordinate system rather than the Cartesian one. Despite being pre-trained on a dataset more than six times smaller than the widely used IIT-CDIP corpus, DocPolarBERT achieves state-of-the-art results. These results demonstrate that a carefully designed attention mechanism can compensate for reduced pre-training data, offering an efficient and effective alternative for document understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To ensure equitable access to the benefits of large language models (LLMs), it is essential to evaluate their capabilities across the world's languages. We introduce the AI Language Proficiency Monitor, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark that systematically assesses LLM performance across up to 200 languages, with a particular focus on low-resource languages. Our benchmark aggregates diverse tasks including translation, question answering, math, and reasoning, using datasets such as FLORES+, MMLU, GSM8K, TruthfulQA, and ARC. We provide an open-source, auto-updating leaderboard and dashboard that supports researchers, developers, and policymakers in identifying strengths and gaps in model performance. In addition to ranking models, the platform offers descriptive insights such as a global proficiency map and trends over time. By complementing and extending prior multilingual benchmarks, our work aims to foster transparency, inclusivity, and progress in multilingual AI. The system is available atthis https URL.

  _Ziyi Huang, Xia Cui_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components: document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28 languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86% in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the superior text mining alternative.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are availablethis https URL.

  _David Schlangen, Sherzod Hakimov, Jonathan Jordan, Philipp Sadler_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models (LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first, carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability, difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235 essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted 325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The deep integration of large language models and automatic speech recognition systems has become a promising research direction with high practical value. To address the overfitting issue commonly observed in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, this work proposes an innovative training paradigm Iterative LoRA Training (ILT) in combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM), achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2 (Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility and strong application potential of our approach.

  _Marina Luketina, Andrea Benkel, Christoph G. Schuetz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured background information.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score, misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work, we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops across various domains.

  _Zilu Dong, Xiangqing Shen, Zinong Yang, Rui Xia_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their transformative potential across numerous disciplinary studies, reshaping the existing research methodologies and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. However, a systematic understanding of their integration into diverse disciplines remains underexplored. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the application of LLMs in interdisciplinary studies, categorising research efforts from both a technical perspective and with regard to their applicability. From a technical standpoint, key methodologies such as supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation, agent-based approaches, and tool-use integration are examined, which enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By providing a comprehensive overview of the technical developments and applications in this field, this survey aims to serve as an invaluable resource for the researchers who are navigating the complex landscape of LLMs in the context of interdisciplinary studies.

  _Benjamin Newman, Abhilasha Ravichander, Jaehun Jung, Rui Xin, Hamish Ivison, Yegor Kuznetsov, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models' own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents, and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks. Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages, n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate: (1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail, merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs) that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second, retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However, they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage". Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT tasks.

  We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks, where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity. Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

  Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication affects individuals differently based on gender.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory (IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model- and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable proxies based on our findings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to their safe and reliable deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods, TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g., black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type (self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation, calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio. The code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs. Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs. Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

  _Vivek Chari, Benjamin Van Durme_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache, which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked (query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias. How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner -- minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e., callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows (e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review. We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental impact statements.

  _Junyi Wen, Junyuan Liang, Zicong Hong, Wuhui Chen, Zibin Zheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable accuracy degradation.We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without compromising generation quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks: AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances. For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training. In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically, using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68 publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1) reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o, LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks. Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment. We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be applied to broader research areas.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been adequately studied.In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations. ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence, without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for embedding-aware defenses.

  A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask, Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon, arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

  This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model, across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering, Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps, particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks, it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

  With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

  As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.

  Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural: reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context, German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. We pre-trained GeistBERT using fairseq, following the RoBERTa base configuration with Whole Word Masking (WWM), and initialized from GottBERT weights. The model was trained on a 1.3 TB German corpus with dynamic masking and a fixed sequence length of 512 tokens. For evaluation, we fine-tuned the model on standard downstream tasks, including NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014), text classification (GermEval 2018 coarse/fine, 10kGNAD), and NLI (German XNLI), using $F_1$ score and accuracy as evaluation metrics. GeistBERT achieved strong results across all tasks, leading among base models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in GermEval 2018 fine text classification. It also outperformed several larger models, particularly in classification benchmarks. To support research in German NLP, we release GeistBERT under the MIT license.

  We present the design process and findings of the pre-conference workshop at the Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (2024) entitled Red Teaming Large Language Models for Healthcare, which took place on August 15, 2024. Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present the results of a replication study assessing the vulnerabilities across all LLMs provided.

  _Ritesh Goru, Shanay Mehta, Prateek Jain_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on multi-turn reasoning datasets requires N (number of turns) separate forward passes per conversation due to reasoning token visibility constraints, as reasoning tokens for a turn are discarded in subsequent turns. We propose duplicating response tokens along with a custom attention mask to enable single-pass processing of entire conversations. We prove our method produces identical losses to the N-pass approach while reducing time complexity from $O\bigl(N^{3}\bigl)$ to $O\bigl(N^{2}\bigl)$ and maintaining the same memory complexity for a transformer based model. Our approach achieves significant training speedup while preserving accuracy. Our implementation is available online (this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.

  Background. Systematic reviews in comparative effectiveness research require timely evidence synthesis. Preprints accelerate knowledge dissemination but vary in quality, posing challenges for systematic reviews.Methods. We propose AutoConfidence (automated confidence assessment), an advanced framework for predicting preprint publication, which reduces reliance on manual curation and expands the range of predictors, including three key advancements: (1) automated data extraction using natural language processing techniques, (2) semantic embeddings of titles and abstracts, and (3) large language model (LLM)-driven evaluation scores. Additionally, we employed two prediction models: a random forest classifier for binary outcome and a survival cure model that predicts both binary outcome and publication risk over time.Results. The random forest classifier achieved AUROC 0.692 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.733 with semantic embeddings and 0.747 with article usage metrics. The survival cure model reached AUROC 0.716 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.731 with semantic embeddings. For publication risk prediction, it achieved a concordance index of 0.658, increasing to 0.667 with semantic embeddings.Conclusion. Our study advances the framework for preprint publication prediction through automated data extraction and multiple feature integration. By combining semantic embeddings with LLM-driven evaluations, AutoConfidence enhances predictive performance while reducing manual annotation burden. The framework has the potential to facilitate incorporation of preprint articles during the appraisal phase of systematic reviews, supporting researchers in more effective utilization of preprint resources.

  An ideal model evaluation should achieve two goals: identifying where the model fails and providing actionable improvement guidance. Toward these goals for language model (LM) evaluations, we formulate the problem of generating a weakness profile, a set of weaknesses expressed in natural language, given an LM's performance on every individual instance in a benchmark. We introduce a suite of quantitative assessments to compare different weakness profiling methods. We also introduce a weakness profiling method EvalTree. EvalTree constructs a capability tree where each node represents a capability described in natural language and is linked to a subset of benchmark instances that specifically evaluate this capability; it then extracts nodes where the LM performs poorly to generate a weakness profile. On the MATH and WildChat benchmarks, we show that EvalTree outperforms baseline weakness profiling methods by identifying weaknesses more precisely and comprehensively. Weakness profiling further enables weakness-guided data collection, and training data collection guided by EvalTree-identified weaknesses improves LM performance more than other data collection strategies. We also show how EvalTree exposes flaws in Chatbot Arena's human-voter-based evaluation practice. To facilitate future work, we provide an interface that allows practitioners to interactively explore the capability trees built by EvalTree.

  _Zhipeng Wei, Yuqi Liu, N. Benjamin Erichson_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Jailbreaking techniques trick Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing restricted output, posing a potential threat. One line of defense is to use another LLM as a Judge to evaluate the harmfulness of generated text. However, we reveal that these Judge LLMs are vulnerable to token segmentation bias, an issue that arises when delimiters alter the tokenization process, splitting words into smaller sub-tokens. This alters the embeddings of the entire sequence, reducing detection accuracy and allowing harmful content to be misclassified as safe. In this paper, we introduce Emoji Attack, a novel strategy that amplifies existing jailbreak prompts by exploiting token segmentation bias. Our method leverages in-context learning to systematically insert emojis into text before it is evaluated by a Judge LLM, inducing embedding distortions that significantly lower the likelihood of detecting unsafe content. Unlike traditional delimiters, emojis also introduce semantic ambiguity, making them particularly effective in this attack. Through experiments on state-of-the-art Judge LLMs, we demonstrate that Emoji Attack substantially reduces the unsafe prediction rate, bypassing existing safeguards.

  Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become an important way of information access, there have been increasing concerns that LLMs may intensify the spread of unethical content, including implicit bias that hurts certain populations without explicit harmful words. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks in English, their performance in lower-resourced languages like Hebrew, especially for generative tasks such as abstractive summarization, remains unclear. The high morphological richness in Hebrew adds further challenges due to the ambiguity in sentence comprehension and the complexities in meaning construction. In this paper, we address this resource and evaluation gap by introducing HeSum, a novel benchmark specifically designed for abstractive text summarization in Modern Hebrew. HeSum consists of 10,000 article-summary pairs sourced from Hebrew news websites written by professionals. Linguistic analysis confirms HeSum's high abstractness and unique morphological challenges. We show that HeSum presents distinct difficulties for contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, establishing it as a valuable testbed for generative language technology in Hebrew, and MRLs generative challenges in general.

  _Kaixuan Huang, Xudong Guo, Mengdi Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding reduces the inference latency of a target large language model via utilizing a smaller and faster draft model. Its performance depends on a hyperparameter K -- the candidate length, i.e., the number of candidate tokens for the target model to verify in each round. However, previous methods often use simple heuristics to choose K, which may result in sub-optimal performance. We study the choice of the candidate length K and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. We theoretically show that the optimal policy of this Markov decision process takes the form of a threshold policy, i.e., the current speculation should stop and be verified when the probability of getting a rejection exceeds a threshold value. Motivated by this theory, we propose SpecDec++, an enhanced version of speculative decoding that adaptively determines the candidate length on the fly. We augment the draft model with a trained acceptance prediction head to predict the conditional acceptance probability of the candidate tokens. SpecDec++ will stop the current speculation when the predicted probability that at least one token gets rejected exceeds a threshold. We implement SpecDec++ and apply it to the llama-2-chat 7B & 70B model pair. Our adaptive method achieves a 2.04x speedup on the Alpaca dataset (7.2% improvement over the baseline speculative decoding). On the GSM8K and HumanEval datasets, our method achieves a 2.26x speedup (9.4% improvement) and 2.23x speedup (11.1% improvement), respectively. The code of this paper is available atthis https URL.

  _Stefan F. Schouten, Peter Bloem, Ilia Markov, Piek Vossen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work has demonstrated that the latent spaces of large language models (LLMs) contain directions predictive of the truth of sentences. Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

  Objectieve:This review aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) utilization in mental health care, evaluating their effectiveness, identifying challenges, and exploring their potential for future application. Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. The review includes all types of original research, regardless of peer-review status, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023. Studies were included without language restrictions if they employed LLMs developed after T5 and directly investigated research questions within mental health care settings. Results: Out of an initial 313 articles, 34 were selected based on their relevance to LLMs applications in mental health care and the rigor of their reported outcomes. The review identified various LLMs applications in mental health care, including diagnostics, therapy, and enhancing patient engagement. Key challenges highlighted were related to data availability and reliability, the nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. While LLMs showed promise in improving accuracy and accessibility, significant gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were noted. Conclusion: LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.

  One of the primary challenges in online learning environments, is to retain learner engagement. Several different instructional strategies are proposed both in online and offline environments to enhance learner engagement. The Concept Attainment Model is one such instructional strategy that focuses on learners acquiring a deeper understanding of a concept rather than just its dictionary definition. This is done by searching and listing the properties used to distinguish examples from non-examples of various concepts. Our work attempts to apply the Concept Attainment Model to build conceptual riddles, to deploy over online learning environments. The approach involves creating factual triples from learning resources, classifying them based on their uniqueness to a concept into `Topic Markers' and `Common', followed by generating riddles based on the Concept Attainment Model's format and capturing all possible solutions to those riddles. The results obtained from the human evaluation of riddles prove encouraging.

  Automatic question answering is an important yet challenging task in E-commerce given the millions of questions posted by users about the product that they are interested in purchasing. Hence, there is a great demand for automatic answer generation systems that provide quick responses using related information about the product. There are three sources of knowledge available for answering a user posted query, they are reviews, duplicate or similar questions, and specifications. Effectively utilizing these information sources will greatly aid us in answering complex questions. However, there are two main challenges present in exploiting these sources: (i) The presence of irrelevant information and (ii) the presence of ambiguity of sentiment present in reviews and similar questions. Through this work we propose a novel pipeline (MSQAP) that utilizes the rich information present in the aforementioned sources by separately performing relevancy and ambiguity prediction before generating a response.Experimental results show that our relevancy prediction model (BERT-QA) outperforms all other variants and has an improvement of 12.36% in F1 score compared to the BERT-base baseline. Our generation model (T5-QA) outperforms the baselines in all content preservation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and has an average improvement of 35.02% in ROUGE and 198.75% in BLEU compared to the highest performing baseline (HSSC-q). Human evaluation of our pipeline shows us that our method has an overall improvement in accuracy of 30.7% over the generation model (T5-QA), resulting in our full pipeline-based approach (MSQAP) providing more accurate answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the e-commerce domain that automatically generates natural language answers combining the information present in diverse sources such as specifications, similar questions, and reviews data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as "compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely, given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time, given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach, achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size, rendering quality, and rendering speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3) Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with unprecedented controllability.

  This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and classthis http URLmodel's design enables robust handling of intraclass variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images, demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications in pattern recognition.

  Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing. Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning, distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model, and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio, post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished within 60 seconds for all models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making. A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy, communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible, context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm, which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism (BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic consistency and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we present TransLU, a dual-branch cross-domain transfer framework comprising two key components: Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing (CDKS) and Cross-Domain Semantic Alignment (CDSA). TransLU supports dynamic category expansion and facilitates the effective adaptation of LCLU models to heterogeneous hierarchies. In addition, we construct MM-5B, a large-scale multi-modal hierarchical land use dataset featuring pixel-wise annotations. The code and MM-5B dataset will be released at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV) features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case, orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of 457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

  The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability. This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

  _Debashis Gupta, Aditi Golder, Rongkhun Zhu, Kangning Cui, Wei Tang, Fan Yang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets. Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO), where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

  _Zach Eidex, Mojtaba Safari, Tonghe Wang, Vanessa Wildman, David S. Yu, Hui Mao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly, scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts. We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize 7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods: Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding 7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128 slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices), 19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145 slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans, respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/- 4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs, and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using 10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T (0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods. Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

  _Junho Koh, Youngwoo Lee, Jungho Kim, Dongyoung Lee, Jun Won Choi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view (BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations. Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

  This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN) for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates, handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be standardized.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting; entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data, adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment. We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets. Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining efficiency.

  This study aims to develop a novel multi-modal fusion framework for brain tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization. Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55, respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by 17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes. Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation. DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

  Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches. Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging repositories.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts, applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR), which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues. Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

  This work presents a unified, fully differentiable model for multi-people tracking that learns to associate detections into trajectories without relying on pre-computed tracklets. The model builds a dynamic spatiotemporal graph that aggregates spatial, contextual, and temporal information, enabling seamless information propagation across entire sequences. To improve occlusion handling, the graph can also encode scene-specific information. We also introduce a new large-scale dataset with 25 partially overlapping views, detailed scene reconstructions, and extensive occlusions. Experiments show the model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and the new dataset, with flexibility across diverse conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era. While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Through flexible synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks, thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning. Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022, F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET 2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research and practical clinical deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of future document foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications, including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models, exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be released publicly to benefit the community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques, which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal: decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world. Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually intact objects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2) prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval. Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types: point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ, MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets. However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may degrade retrieval performance.This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic structure.First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes. Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to convert images into binary hash codes.Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance. Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71% in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion, where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement (IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all metrics.

  Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories. Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties, such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies. Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

  _Sen Wang, Shao Zeng, Tianjun Gu, Zhizhong Zhang, Ruixin Zhang, Shouhong Ding, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding, constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding, which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF). Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless, its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

  Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis. Code is available atthis https URL

  Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable generative modeling by routing generation through explicit, human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while maintaining competitive visual quality.

  Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning. In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40 volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However, the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution, the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection.

  The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large, clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury, lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone video atthis https URL.

SurfDist is a modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging, SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D. These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be learned effectively alongside instance membership.

  In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation. Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust, fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient, allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model with an mAP50 of 0.801.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a 3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space. Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the $\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view synthesis.

  Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents, particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

  Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality, analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches, including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy, low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs. Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters, demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy, and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems for space-based applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder (ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement (COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method, ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

  The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many, showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro 1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments. These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

  Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However, challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

  Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast, and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project websitethis https URL.

  Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations: (1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable performance when critical modalities arethis http URLaddress these challenges, we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities, ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting its superior adaptability and reliability.

  Recent works have revisited the infamous task ``Name That Dataset'', demonstrating that non-medical datasets contain underlying biases and that the dataset origin task can be solved with high accuracy. In this work, we revisit the same task applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether dataset bias also exists in these datasets. To extend our work, we apply simple transformations to the datasets, repeat the same task, and perform an analysis to identify and explain any detected biases. Given the importance of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of more open-source datasets in the medical domain.

  Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields, often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs. Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

  Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose \textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1) Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2) Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to 0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models, struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames, often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the same individuals or objects, leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations. This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity connections across frames. We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models to discriminate between coherent image sequences and stories from unrelated images. We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to teach appropriate entity connection behavior. We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic contexts. Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on Qwen2.5-VL 7B). Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1 from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%). Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except "its", and cross-frame character and object persistence increased across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%). Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story, increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

  Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models (image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure under $1,000 USD.

Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence, military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant progress, existing HAD methods continue to face challenges such as high computational complexity, sensitivity to noise, and limited generalisation across diverse datasets. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models, representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets using different performance metrics, such as ROC, AUC, and separability map to analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths, limitations, and directions for future research. Our findings highlight that deep learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This survey aims to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

  _Quanxin Zheng, Miao Fan, Shengtong Xu, Linghe Kong, Haoyi Xiong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vectorized maps are indispensable for precise navigation and the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. Traditional methods for constructing these maps fall into two categories: offline techniques, which rely on expensive, labor-intensive LiDAR data collection and manual annotation, and online approaches that use onboard cameras to reduce costs but suffer from limited performance, especially at complex intersections. To bridge this gap, we introduce MRC-VMap, a cost-effective, vision-centric, end-to-end neural network designed to generate high-definition vectorized maps directly at intersections. Leveraging existing roadside surveillance cameras, MRC-VMap directly converts time-aligned, multi-directional images into vectorized map representations. This integrated solution lowers the need for additional intermediate modules--such as separate feature extraction and Bird's-Eye View (BEV) conversion steps--thus reducing both computational overhead and error propagation. Moreover, the use of multiple camera views enhances mapping completeness, mitigates occlusions, and provides robust performance under practical deployment constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on 4,000 intersections across 4 major metropolitan areas in China demonstrate that MRC-VMap not only outperforms state-of-the-art online methods but also achieves accuracy comparable to high-cost LiDAR-based approaches, thereby offering a scalable and efficient solution for modern autonomous navigation systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features, and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised, statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation, thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels. Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed method.

  Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting. The code is available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows.

  Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs. We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets. Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

  Accurately analyzing the motion parts and their motion attributes in dynamic environments is crucial for advancing key areas such as embodied intelligence. Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data. Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method, we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial recognition systems have achieved remarkable success by leveraging deep neural networks, advanced loss functions, and large-scale datasets. However, their performance often deteriorates in real-world scenarios involving low-quality facial images. Such degradations, common in surveillance footage or standoff imaging include low resolution, motion blur, and various distortions, resulting in a substantial domain gap from the high-quality data typically used during training. While existing approaches attempt to address robustness by modifying network architectures or modeling global spatial transformations, they frequently overlook local, non-rigid deformations that are inherently present in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce \textbf{DArFace}, a \textbf{D}eformation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{r}obust \textbf{Face} recognition framework that enhances robustness to such degradations without requiring paired high- and low-quality training samples. Our method adversarially integrates both global transformations (e.g., rotation, translation) and local elastic deformations during training to simulate realistic low-quality conditions. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive objective to enforce identity consistency across different deformed views. Extensive evaluations on low-quality benchmarks including TinyFace, IJB-B, and IJB-C demonstrate that DArFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with significant gains attributed to the inclusion of local deformation modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unauthorized screen capturing and dissemination pose severe security threats such as data leakage and information theft. Several studies propose robust watermarking methods to track the copyright of Screen-Camera (SC) images, facilitating post-hoc certification against infringement. These techniques typically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network fitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC. However, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective approximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased approximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence of interdependence among the noise components. Supervised networks require paired data to train the noise-fitting model, and it is difficult for the model to learn all the features of the noise. To address the above issues, we propose Simulation-to-Real (S2R). Specifically, an unsupervised noise layer employs unpaired data to learn the discrepancy between the modeled simulated noise distribution and the real-world SC noise distribution, rather than directly learning the mapping from sharp images to real-world images. Learning this transformation from simulation to reality is inherently simpler, as it primarily involves bridging the gap in noise distributions, instead of the complex task of reconstructing fine-grained image details. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior watermark robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) exhibit promising potential for multi-modal understanding, yet their application to video-based emotion recognition remains limited by insufficient spatial and contextual awareness. Traditional approaches, which prioritize isolated facial features, often neglect critical non-verbal cues such as body language, environmental context, and social interactions, leading to reduced robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer vision is transforming fashion industry through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, in contrast, extracts standardized garment images from photos of clothed individuals. We introduce Multi-Garment TryOffDiff (MGT), a diffusion-based VTOFF model capable of handling diverse garment types, including upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. MGT builds on a latent diffusion architecture with SigLIP-based image conditioning to capture garment characteristics such as shape, texture, and pattern. To address garment diversity, MGT incorporates class-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art VTOFF results on VITON-HD and competitive performance on DressCode. When paired with VTON models, it further enhances p2p-VTON by reducing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin tone, ensuring preservation of person-specific characteristics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves photorealistic novel view synthesis, its performance degrades with motion blur. In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.

  This paper presents MedSegFactory, a versatile medical synthesis framework that generates high-quality paired medical images and segmentation masks across modalities and tasks. It aims to serve as an unlimited data repository, supplying image-mask pairs to enhance existing segmentation tools. The core of MedSegFactory is a dual-stream diffusion model, where one stream synthesizes medical images and the other generates corresponding segmentation masks. To ensure precise alignment between image-mask pairs, we introduce Joint Cross-Attention (JCA), enabling a collaborative denoising paradigm by dynamic cross-conditioning between streams. This bidirectional interaction allows both representations to guide each other's generation, enhancing consistency between generated pairs. MedSegFactory unlocks on-demand generation of paired medical images and segmentation masks through user-defined prompts that specify the target labels, imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and pathological conditions, facilitating scalable and high-quality data generation. This new paradigm of medical image synthesis enables seamless integration into diverse medical imaging workflows, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments show that MedSegFactory generates data of superior quality and usability, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance in 2D and 3D segmentation tasks while addressing data scarcity and regulatory constraints.

  Remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion (STF) addresses the fundamental trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution by combining high temporal-low spatial and high spatial-low temporal imagery. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of deep learning advances in remote sensing STF over the past decade. We establish a systematic taxonomy of deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and sequence models, revealing significant growth in deep learning adoption for STF tasks. Our analysis reveals that CNN-based methods dominate spatial feature extraction, while Transformer architectures show superior performance in capturing long-range temporal dependencies. GAN and diffusion models demonstrate exceptional capability in detail reconstruction, substantially outperforming traditional methods in structural similarity and spectral fidelity. Through comprehensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets comparing ten representative methods, we validate these findings and quantify the performance trade-offs between different approaches. We identify five critical challenges: time-space conflicts, limited generalization across datasets, computational efficiency for large-scale processing, multi-source heterogeneous fusion, and insufficient benchmark diversity. The survey highlights promising opportunities in foundation models, hybrid architectures, and self-supervised learning approaches that could address current limitations and enable multimodal applications.

  Instruction-based video editing allows effective and interactive editing of videos using only instructions without extra inputs such as masks or attributes. However, collecting high-quality training triplets (source video, edited video, instruction) is a challenging task. Existing datasets mostly consist of low-resolution, short duration, and limited amount of source videos with unsatisfactory editing quality, limiting the performance of trained editing models. In this work, we present a high-quality Instruction-based Video Editing dataset with 1M triplets, namely InsViE-1M. We first curate high-resolution and high-quality source videos and images, then design an effective editing-filtering pipeline to construct high-quality editing triplets for model training. For a source video, we generate multiple edited samples of its first frame with different intensities of classifier-free guidance, which are automatically filtered by GPT-4o with carefully crafted guidelines. The edited first frame is propagated to subsequent frames to produce the edited video, followed by another round of filtering for frame quality and motion evaluation. We also generate and filter a variety of video editing triplets from high-quality images. With the InsViE-1M dataset, we propose a multi-stage learning strategy to train our InsViE model, progressively enhancing its instruction following and editing ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our InsViE-1M dataset and the trained model over state-of-the-art works. Codes are available at \href{this https URL}{InsViE}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.

  Human pose estimation is a critical task in computer vision and sports biomechanics, with applications spanning sports science, rehabilitation, and biomechanical research. While significant progress has been made in monocular 3D pose estimation, current datasets often fail to capture the complex, high-acceleration movements typical of competitive sports. In this work, we introduce AthletePose3D, a novel dataset designed to address this gap. AthletePose3D includes 12 types of sports motions across various disciplines, with approximately 1.3 million frames and 165 thousand individual postures, specifically capturing high-speed, high-acceleration athletic movements. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular 2D and 3D pose estimation models on the dataset, revealing that models trained on conventional datasets perform poorly on athletic motions. However, fine-tuning these models on AthletePose3D notably reduces the SOTA model mean per joint position error (MPJPE) from 214mm to 65mm-a reduction of over 69%. We also validate the kinematic accuracy of monocular pose estimations through waveform analysis, highlighting strong correlations in joint angle estimations but limitations in velocity estimation. Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of monocular pose estimation models in the context of sports, contributing valuable insights for advancing monocular pose estimation techniques in high-performance sports environments.

  We present X-Dancer, a novel zero-shot music-driven image animation pipeline that creates diverse and long-range lifelike human dance videos from a single static image. As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.

  Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) represents a critical and challenging subtask within the general VQA domain. Despite significant advancements in general VQA, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still exhibit substantial limitations when handling multi-task VQA scenarios. These limitations manifest through erroneous spatial localization and misinterpretation of medical images, which primarily arise from two fundamental issues: inadequate image-text alignment and insufficient domain-specified knowledge for medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce the Cross-Modal Clinical Knowledge Distiller (ClinKD), an innovative framework designed to enhance image-text alignment and establish more effective medical knowledge transformation mechanisms, which enables MLLMs to perform better even when lacking prior medical knowledge. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the ClinKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets which are challenging for Med-VQA task. The results indicate that our approach not only significantly improves image-text alignment but also effectively enables MLLMs to adapt to the medical knowledge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point transformers have demonstrated remarkable progress in 3D understanding through expanded receptive fields (RF), but further expanding the RF leads to dilution in group attention and decreases detailed feature extraction capability. Proxy, which serves as abstract representations for simplifying feature maps, enables global RF. However, existing proxy-based approaches face critical limitations: Global proxies incur quadratic complexity for large-scale point clouds and suffer positional ambiguity, while local proxy alternatives struggle with 1) Unreliable sampling from the geometrically diverse point cloud, 2) Inefficient proxy interaction computation, and 3) Imbalanced local-global information fusion; To address these challenges, we propose Sparse Proxy Point Transformer (SP$^{2}$T) -- a local proxy-based dual-stream point transformer with three key innovations: First, for reliable sampling, spatial-wise proxy sampling with vertex-based associations enables robust sampling on geometrically diverse point clouds. Second, for efficient proxy interaction, sparse proxy attention with a table-based relative bias effectively achieves the interaction with efficient map-reduce computation. Third, for local-global information fusion, our dual-stream architecture maintains local-global balance through parallel branches. Comprehensive experiments reveal that SP$^{2}$T sets state-of-the-art results with acceptable latency on indoor and outdoor 3D comprehension benchmarks, demonstrating marked improvement (+3.8% mIoU vs. SPoTr@S3DIS, +22.9% mIoU vs. PointASNL@Sem.KITTI) compared to other proxy-based point cloud methods.

  Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Notably, compared with previous best-performing methods, FreeScale unlocks the 8k-resolution text-to-image generation for the first time.

  Visual text rendering are widespread in various real-world applications, requiring careful font selection and typographic choices. Recent progress in diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-image (T2I) models show promise in automating these processes. However, these methods still encounter challenges like inconsistent fonts, style variation, and limited fine-grained control, particularly at the word-level. This paper proposes a two-stage DiT-based pipeline to address these problems by enhancing controllability over typography and style in text rendering. We introduce typography control fine-tuning (TC-FT), an parameter-efficient fine-tuning method (on $5\%$ key parameters) with enclosing typography control tokens (ETC-tokens), which enables precise word-level application of typographic features. To further address style inconsistency in text rendering, we propose a text-agnostic style control adapter (SCA) that prevents content leakage while enhancing style consistency. To implement TC-FT and SCA effectively, we incorporated HTML-render into the data synthesis pipeline and proposed the first word-level controllable dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior word-level typographic control, font consistency, and style consistency in text rendering tasks. The datasets and models will be available for academic use.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-modal sensor fusion in Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation has become the leading approach for 3D object detection. However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders to transform image features into BEV space, which reduces robustness or introduces significant computational overhead. Moreover, the insufficient geometric guidance in view transformation results in ray-directional misalignments, limiting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient View Transformation (EVT), a novel 3D object detection framework that constructs a well-structured BEV representation, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach focuses on two key aspects. First, Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), which utilizes LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels, enables more effective transformation of image features into BEV space and a refined BEV representation. Second, an improved query-based detection framework, incorporating group-wise mixed query selection and geometry-aware cross-attention, effectively captures both the common properties and the geometric structure of objects in the transformer decoder. On the nuScenes test set, EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance of 75.3% NDS with real-time inference speed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually learn new classes from only a few samples without forgetting previous ones, requiring intelligent agents to adapt to dynamic environments. FSCIL combines the characteristics and challenges of class-incremental learning and few-shot learning: (i) Current classes occupy the entire feature space, which is detrimental to learning new classes. (ii) The small number of samples in incremental rounds is insufficient for fully training. In existing mainstream virtual class methods, for addressing the challenge (i), they attempt to use virtual classes as placeholders. However, new classes may not necessarily align with the virtual classes. For the challenge (ii), they replace trainable fully connected layers with Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifiers based on cosine similarity, but NCM classifiers do not account for sample imbalance issues. To address these issues in previous methods, we propose the class-center guided embedding Space Allocation with Angle-Norm joint classifiers (SAAN) learning framework, which provides balanced space for all classes and leverages norm differences caused by sample imbalance to enhance classification criteria. Specifically, for challenge (i), SAAN divides the feature space into multiple subspaces and allocates a dedicated subspace for each session by guiding samples with the pre-set category centers. For challenge (ii), SAAN establishes a norm distribution for each class and generates angle-norm joint logits. Experiments demonstrate that SAAN can achieve state-of-the-art performance and it can be directly embedded into other SOTA methods as a plug-in, further enhancing their performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations have demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis; further, material-lighting disentanglement on 3DGS warrants relighting capabilities and its adaptability to broader applications. While the general approach to the latter operation lies in integrating differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to jointly recover BRDF materials and environment lighting, achieving a precise disentanglement remains an inherently difficult task due to the challenge of accurately modeling light transport. Existing approaches typically approximate Gaussian points' normals, which constitute an implicit geometric constraint. However, they usually suffer from inaccuracies in normal estimation that subsequently degrade light transport, resulting in noisy material decomposition and flawed relighting results. To address this, we propose GeoSplatting, a novel approach that augments 3DGS with explicit geometry guidance for precise light transport modeling. By differentiably constructing a surface-grounded 3DGS from an optimizable mesh, our approach leverages well-defined mesh normals and the opaque mesh surface, and additionally facilitates the use of mesh-based ray tracing techniques for efficient, occlusion-aware light transport calculations. This enhancement ensures precise material decomposition while preserving the efficiency and high-quality rendering capabilities of 3DGS. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoSplatting, highlighting its superior efficiency and state-of-the-art inverse rendering performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) has become essential to counter performance degradation caused by distribution shifts between training and deployment domains. However, a critical factor influencing DAOD - context bias resulting from learned foreground-background (FG-BG) associations - has remained underexplored. We address three key questions regarding FG BG associations in object detection: are FG-BG associations encoded during the training, is there a causal relationship between FG-BG associations and detection performance, and is there an effect of FG-BG association on DAOD. To examine how models capture FG BG associations, we analyze class-wise and feature-wise performance degradation using background masking and feature perturbation, measured via change in accuracies (defined as drop rate). To explore the causal role of FG-BG associations, we apply do-calculus on FG-BG pairs guided by class activation mapping (CAM). To quantify the causal influence of FG-BG associations across domains, we propose a novel metric - domain association gradient - defined as the ratio of drop rate to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Through systematic experiments involving background masking, feature-level perturbations, and CAM, we reveal that convolution-based object detection models encode FG-BG associations. Our results demonstrate that context bias not only exists but causally undermines the generalization capabilities of object detection models across domains. Furthermore, we validate these findings across multiple models and datasets, including state-of-the-art architectures such as ALDI++. This study highlights the necessity of addressing context bias explicitly in DAOD frameworks, providing insights that pave the way for developing more robust and generalizable object detection systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose Amortized Posterior Sampling (APS), a novel variational inference approach for efficient posterior sampling in inverse problems. Our method trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined by the diffusion model. This results in a powerful, amortized sampler capable of generating diverse posterior samples with a single neural function evaluation, generalizing across various measurements. Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.

  Most dataset distillation methods struggle to accommodate large-scale datasets due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. Recent research has begun to explore scalable disentanglement methods. However, there are still performance bottlenecks and room for optimization in this direction. In this paper, we present a curriculum-based dataset distillation framework aiming to harmonize performance and scalability. This framework strategically distills synthetic images, adhering to a curriculum that transitions from simple to complex. By incorporating curriculum evaluation, we address the issue of previous methods generating images that tend to be homogeneous and simplistic, doing so at a manageable computational cost. Furthermore, we introduce adversarial optimization towards synthetic images to further improve their representativeness and safeguard against their overfitting to the neural network involved in distilling. This enhances the generalization capability of the distilled images across various neural network architectures and also increases their robustness to noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework sets new benchmarks in large-scale dataset distillation, achieving substantial improvements of 11.1\% on Tiny-ImageNet, 9.0\% on ImageNet-1K, and 7.3\% on ImageNet-21K.

  Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset. We share our code here:this https URL

  Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The class-agnostic counting (CAC) task has recently been proposed to solve the problem of counting all objects of an arbitrary class with several exemplars given in the input image. To address this challenging task, existing leading methods all resort to density map regression, which renders them impractical for downstream tasks that require object locations and restricts their ability to well explore the scale information of exemplars for supervision. To address the limitations, we propose a novel localization-based CAC approach, termed Scale-modulated Query and Localization Network (SQLNet). It fully explores the scales of exemplars in both the query and localization stages and achieves effective counting by accurately locating each object and predicting its approximate size. Specifically, during the query stage, rich discriminative representations of the target class are acquired by the Hierarchical Exemplars Collaborative Enhancement (HECE) module from the few exemplars through multi-scale exemplar cooperation with equifrequent size prompt embedding. These representations are then fed into the Exemplars-Unified Query Correlation (EUQC) module to interact with the query features in a unified manner and produce the correlated query tensor. In the localization stage, the Scale-aware Multi-head Localization (SAML) module utilizes the query tensor to predict the confidence, location, and size of each potential object. Moreover, a scale-aware localization loss is introduced, which exploits flexible location associations and exemplar scales for supervision to optimize the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SQLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular CAC benchmarks, achieving excellent performance not only in counting accuracy but also in localization and bounding box generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advancement of vision-based autonomous driving technology, pedestrian detection have become an important component for improving traffic safety and driving system robustness. Nevertheless, in complex traffic scenarios, conventional pose estimation approaches frequently fail to accurately reconstruct occluded keypoints, primarily due to obstructions caused by vehicles, vegetation, or architectural elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time occluded pedestrian pose completion framework termed Separation and Dimensionality Reduction-based Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (SDR-GAIN). Unlike previous approaches that train visual models to distinguish occlusion patterns, SDR-GAIN aims to learn human pose directly from the numerical distribution of keypoint coordinates and interpolate missing positions. It employs a self-supervised adversarial learning paradigm to train lightweight generators with residual structures for the imputation of missing pose keypoints. Additionally, it integrates multiple pose standardization techniques to alleviate the difficulty of the learning process. Experiments conducted on the COCO and JAAD datasets demonstrate that SDR-GAIN surpasses conventional machine learning and Transformer-based missing data interpolation algorithms in accurately recovering occluded pedestrian keypoints, while simultaneously achieving microsecond-level real-time inference.

- **[The Non-Linear Representation Dilemma: Is Causal Abstraction Enough for Mechanistic Interpretability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802)**  `arXiv:2507.08802`  
  _Denis Sutter, Julian Minder, Thomas Hofmann, Tiago Pimentel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question: causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information. Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

  Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step." can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data atthis https URLandthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.

  _Chenyang Song, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Yingfa Chen, Yuxuan Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (this https URL).

  Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

  Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity, especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput, and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

  _Chuanqi Chen, Zhongrui Wang, Nan Chen, Jin-Long Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems, e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear, i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization, inverse problems, and optimal control.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity (movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly learned tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation, and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT) framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI adoption in thermal power systems.

  _Uri Stern, Eli Corn, Daphna Weinshall_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected. This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice. But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent phenomenon.Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing performance without added inference cost.Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference complexity.

  _Vincenzo Dentamaro_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving linear efficiency.Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks (vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer, Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy, WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However, existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems, and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models. Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77) with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and measure program impacts at scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture, which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2 iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods. AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\% improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on model sizes up to 350M parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.

  _Tianyou Jiang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists. Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing (SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA annotation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years. However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data. Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem. Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications. This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on mobile devices, evaluatingthis http URL, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization, temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience. Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks, highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete spaces for reaction prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use. Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered. In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

  Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model. Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS) method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling (RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method. Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS, respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex, a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs: natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations process.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here, we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal; and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking, reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However, inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations, particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in accuracy under varying compute budgets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However, recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase, Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

  Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values, leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical clustering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to $96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good performances considering also precision and recall.

  Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based, still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel structures in process descriptions.This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset, which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets. This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

  Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile, interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse. Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic models.

  Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse, high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes, leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights) adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27% compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

  Clustering is a critical component of decision-making in todays data-driven environments. It has been widely used in a variety of fields such as bioinformatics, social network analysis, and image processing. However, clustering accuracy remains a major challenge in large datasets. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of strategies for selecting the optimal value of k in clustering, with a focus on achieving a balance between clustering precision and computational efficiency in complex data environments. In addition, this paper introduces improvements to clustering techniques for text and image data to provide insights into better computational performance and cluster validity. The proposed approach is based on the Condensed Silhouette method, along with statistical methods such as Local Structures, Gap Statistics, Class Consistency Ratio, and a Cluster Overlap Index CCR and COIbased algorithm to calculate the best value of k for K-Means clustering. The results of comparative experiments show that the proposed approach achieves up to 99 percent faster execution times on high-dimensional datasets while retaining both precision and scalability, making it highly suitable for real time clustering needs or scenarios demanding efficient clustering with minimal resource utilization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible synthesis in kinematic design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will open-source our entire framework, including all code, model checkpoints, and training configurations atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets, significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex, non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering algorithms).In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based multi-layer propagation procedure.We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by 14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

  Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area. Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy) drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM, fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations, receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise, actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets (Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and mitigating energy inefficiencies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows $\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps, significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks. However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM. Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

  Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions about student performance on new items.

  Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3 hexagonal grids, coupled with Monte Carlo dropout for confidence, the model yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in large-scale urban risk prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs, KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators remains an important direction for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training. This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially, MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD, proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast, simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization} (QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function, removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores, AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g., chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna, an open-source framework for HPO.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover, patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts, where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and individual task gradients-referred to as global and local information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover, directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight \textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors. In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

  Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

  _Marwan Ait Haddou, Mohamed Bennai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel meta learning framework called Sculpture that explicitly conditions the Fubini Study metric tensor of parameterized quantum circuits to mitigate barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms. Our theoretical analysis identifies the logarithmic condition number of the Fubini Study metric as a critical geometric quantity governing trainability, optimization dynamics, and generalization. Sculpture uses a classical meta model trained to generate data dependent quantum circuit initializations that minimize the logarithmic condition number, thereby promoting an isotropic and well conditioned parameter space.Empirical results show that meta training reduces the logarithmic condition number from approximately 1.47 to 0.64 by significantly increasing the minimum eigenvalue and slightly decreasing the maximum eigenvalue of the metric, effectively alleviating barren plateaus. This improved conditioning generalizes well to unseen data, consistently producing well conditioned quantum circuit initializations. In a downstream hybrid quantum classical classification task on the Kaggle diabetes dataset, increasing the meta scaling coefficient accelerates convergence, reduces training loss and gradient norms, and crucially improves generalization, with test accuracy increasing from about 0.68 to over 0.78. These findings demonstrate that sculpting the quantum landscape via meta learning serves as a principled geometric regularizer, substantially enhancing trainability, optimization, and generalization of parameterized quantum circuits and enabling more robust and efficient variational quantum algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV) distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45% in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

  _Nathan Maurer, Harshal Kaushik, Roshni Anna Jacob, Jie Zhang, Souma Chowdhury_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.

  Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However, their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover, Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

  Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for multi-step reasoning processes. Specifically, sparse reward signals fail to deliver effective or sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such reward structures induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across ipntermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a novel method designed to both deliver dense rewards and amplify explorations in the RL-based training paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three key innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; dynamic reward scaling to stabilize exploration and exploitation in large action spaces; and advantage-preserving reward implementation that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across three public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness with a 22.39% improvement on the difficult dataset Countdown-4.

  This study presents a deep learning-based framework for predicting emergency department (ED) boarding counts six hours in advance using only operational and contextual data, without patient-level information. Data from ED tracking systems, inpatient census, weather, holidays, and local events were aggregated hourly and processed with comprehensive feature engineering. The mean ED boarding count was 28.7 (standard deviation = 11.2). Multiple deep learning models, including ResNetPlus, TSTPlus, and TSiTPlus, were trained and optimized using Optuna, with TSTPlus achieving the best results (mean absolute error = 4.30, mean squared error = 29.47, R2 = 0.79). The framework accurately forecasted boarding counts, including during extreme periods, and demonstrated that broader input features improve predictive accuracy. This approach supports proactive hospital management and offers a practical method for mitigating ED overcrowding.

  Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the ability of reasoning models to perform chemistry tasks directly, without any assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ, consisting of 816 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry, focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world applications. The reasoning models, OpenAI's o3-mini, Google's Gemini Pro 2.5, and DeepSeek R1, answered 50%-57% of questions correctly in the highest reasoning modes, with higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks. These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning models which achieved only 3%-7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform. Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures from 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR data, with Gemini Pro 2.5 correctly generating SMILES strings for around 90% of molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure comprising 25 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the latest reasoning models can, in some cases, perform advanced chemical reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization is widely applied in machine learning to reduce computational and storage costs for both data and models. Considering that classification tasks are fundamental to the field, it is crucial to investigate how quantization impacts classification performance. Traditional research has focused on quantization errors, assuming that larger errors generally lead to lower classification accuracy. However, this assumption lacks a solid theoretical foundation and often contradicts empirical observations. For example, despite introducing significant errors, $\{0,1\}$-binary and $\{0, \pm1\}$-ternary quantized data have sometimes achieved classification accuracy comparable or even superior to full-precision data. To reasonably explain this phenomenon, a more accurate evaluation of classification performance is required. To achieve this, we propose a direct analysis of the feature discrimination of quantized data, instead of focusing on quantization errors. Our analysis reveals that both binary and ternary quantization can potentially enhance, rather than degrade, the feature discrimination of the original data. This finding is supported by classification experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecastingthis http URLresults show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a trend in the field of autonomous driving, promising a data-driven, scalable approach to system design. However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system`s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion. To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces a hybrid machine learning-based scale-bridging framework for predicting the permeability of fibrous textile structures. By addressing the computational challenges inherent to multiscale modeling, the proposed approach evaluates the efficiency and accuracy of different scale-bridging methodologies combining traditional surrogate models and even integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with numerical solvers, enabling accurate permeability predictions across micro- and mesoscales. Four methodologies were evaluated: Single Scale Method (SSM), Simple Upscaling Method (SUM), Scale-Bridging Method (SBM), and Fully Resolved Model (FRM). SSM, the simplest method, neglects microscale permeability and exhibited permeability values deviating by up to 150\% of the FRM model, which was taken as ground truth at an equivalent lower fiber volume content. SUM improved predictions by considering uniform microscale permeability, yielding closer values under similar conditions, but still lacked structural variability. The SBM method, incorporating segment-based microscale permeability assignments, showed significant enhancements, achieving almost equivalent values while maintaining computational efficiency and modeling runtimes of ~45 minutes per simulation. In contrast, FRM, which provides the highest fidelity by fully resolving microscale and mesoscale geometries, required up to 270 times more computational time than SSM, with model files exceeding 300 GB. Additionally, a hybrid dual-scale solver incorporating PINNs has been developed and shows the potential to overcome generalization errors and the problem of data scarcity of the data-driven surrogate approaches. The hybrid framework advances permeability modelling by balancing computational cost and prediction reliability, laying the foundation for further applications in fibrous composite manufacturing.

  We propose Electrostatic Field Matching (EFM), a novel method that is suitable for both generative modeling and distribution transfer tasks. Our approach is inspired by the physics of an electrical capacitor. We place source and target distributions on the capacitor plates and assign them positive and negative charges, respectively. We then learn the electrostatic field of the capacitor using a neural network approximator. To map the distributions to each other, we start at one plate of the capacitor and move the samples along the learned electrostatic field lines until they reach the other plate. We theoretically justify that this approach provably yields the distribution transfer. In practice, we demonstrate the performance of our EFM in toy and image data experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study presents a machine learning approach to predict the number of barges transported by vessels on inland waterways using tracking data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). While AIS tracks the location of tug and tow vessels, it does not monitor the presence or number of barges transported by those vessels. Understanding the number and types of barges conveyed along river segments, between ports, and at ports is crucial for estimating the quantities of freight transported on the nation's waterways. This insight is also valuable for waterway management and infrastructure operations impacting areas such as targeted dredging operations, and data-driven resource allocation. Labeled sample data was generated using observations from traffic cameras located along key river segments and matched to AIS data records. A sample of 164 vessels representing up to 42 barge convoys per vessel was used for model development. The methodology involved first predicting barge presence and then predicting barge quantity. Features derived from the AIS data included speed measures, vessel characteristics, turning measures, and interaction terms. For predicting barge presence, the AdaBoost model achieved an F1 score of 0.932. For predicting barge quantity, the Random Forest combined with an AdaBoost ensemble model achieved an F1 score of 0.886. Bayesian optimization was used for hyperparameter tuning. By advancing predictive modeling for inland waterways, this study offers valuable insights for transportation planners and organizations, which require detailed knowledge of traffic volumes, including the flow of commodities, their destinations, and the tonnage moving in and out of ports.

  Time series forecasting often demands a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While recent Transformer models have improved forecasting capabilities, they come with high computational costs. Linear-based models have shown better accuracy than Transformers but still fall short of ideal performance. We propose PIAD-SRNN, a physics-informed adaptive decomposition state-space RNN, that separates seasonal and trend components and embeds domain equations in a recurrent framework. We evaluate PIAD-SRNN's performance on indoor air quality datasets, focusing on CO2 concentration prediction across various forecasting horizons, and results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms SoTA models in both long-term and short-term time series forecasting, including transformer-based architectures, in terms of both MSE and MAE. Besides proposing PIAD-SRNN which balances accuracy with efficiency, this paper also provides four curated datasets. Code and data:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Task Arithmetic is a model merging technique that enables the combination of multiple models' capabilities into a single model through simple arithmetic in the weight space, without the need for additional fine-tuning or access to the original training data. However, the factors that determine the success of Task Arithmetic remain unclear. In this paper, we examine Task Arithmetic for multi-task learning by framing it as a one-shot Federated Learning problem. We demonstrate that Task Arithmetic is mathematically equivalent to the commonly used algorithm in Federated Learning, called Federated Averaging (FedAvg). By leveraging well-established theoretical results from FedAvg, we identify two key factors that impact the performance of Task Arithmetic: data heterogeneity and training heterogeneity. To mitigate these challenges, we adapt several algorithms from Federated Learning to improve the effectiveness of Task Arithmetic. Our experiments demonstrate that applying these algorithms can often significantly boost performance of the merged model compared to the original Task Arithmetic approach. This work bridges Task Arithmetic and Federated Learning, offering new theoretical perspectives on Task Arithmetic and improved practical methodologies for model merging.

  Compositional generalization is a crucial step towards developing data-efficient intelligent machines that generalize in human-like ways. In this work, we tackle a challenging form of distribution shift, termed compositional shift, where some attribute combinations are completely absent at training but present in the test distribution. This shift tests the model's ability to generalize compositionally to novel attribute combinations in discriminative tasks. We model the data with flexible additive energy distributions, where each energy term represents an attribute, and derive a simple alternative to empirical risk minimization termed compositional risk minimization (CRM). We first train an additive energy classifier to predict the multiple attributes and then adjust this classifier to tackle compositional shifts. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of CRM, where we show that our proposal extrapolates to special affine hulls of seen attribute combinations. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets confirms the improved robustness of CRM compared to other methods from the literature designed to tackle various forms of subpopulation shifts.

  On Efficient and Scalable Computation of the Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator in Mixture ModelsTwin support vector machine (TSVM) is an emerging machine learning model with versatile applicability in classification and regression endeavors. Nevertheless, TSVM confronts noteworthy challenges: $(i)$ the imperative demand for matrix inversions presents formidable obstacles to its efficiency and applicability on large-scale datasets; $(ii)$ the omission of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle in its primal formulation heightens the vulnerability to overfitting risks; and $(iii)$ the TSVM exhibits a high susceptibility to noise and outliers, and also demonstrates instability when subjected to resampling. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose the granular ball twin support vector machine (GBTSVM). GBTSVM takes granular balls, rather than individual data points, as inputs to construct a classifier. These granular balls, characterized by their coarser granularity, exhibit robustness to resampling and reduced susceptibility to the impact of noise and outliers. We further propose a novel large-scale granular ball twin support vector machine (LS-GBTSVM). LS-GBTSVM's optimization formulation ensures two critical facets: $(i)$ it eliminates the need for matrix inversions, streamlining the LS-GBTSVM's computational efficiency, and $(ii)$ it incorporates the SRM principle through the incorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of overfitting. The proposed LS-GBTSVM exemplifies efficiency, scalability for large datasets, and robustness against noise and outliers. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the GBTSVM and LS-GBTSVM models on benchmark datasets from UCI, KEEL, and NDC datasets. Our experimental findings and statistical analyses affirm the superior generalization prowess of the proposed GBTSVM and LS-GBTSVM models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A wide variety of queueing systems can be naturally modeled as infinite-state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In the reinforcement learning (RL) context, a variety of algorithms have been developed to learn and optimize these MDPs. At the heart of many popular policy-gradient based learning algorithms, such as natural actor-critic, TRPO, and PPO, lies the Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) policy optimization algorithm. Convergence results for these RL algorithms rest on convergence results for the NPG algorithm. However, all existing results on the convergence of the NPG algorithm are limited to finite-state settings.We study a general class of queueing MDPs, and prove a $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for the NPG algorithm, if the NPG algorithm is initialized with the MaxWeight policy. This is the first convergence rate bound for the NPG algorithm for a general class of infinite-state average-reward MDPs. Moreover, our result applies to a beyond the queueing setting to any countably-infinite MDP satisfying certain mild structural assumptions, given a sufficiently good initial policy. Key to our result are state-dependent bounds on the relative value function achieved by the iterate policies of the NPG algorithm.

  Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier models in a setup with up to 100 agents.

  Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation. Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes. We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

  Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance, efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability. Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic, velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm. The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

  When inverse kinematics (IK) is adopted to control robotic arms in manipulation tasks, there is often a discrepancy between the end effector (EE) position of the robot model in the simulator and the physical EE in reality. In most robotic scenarios with sim-to-real transfer, we have information about joint positions in both simulation and reality, but the EE position is only available in simulation. We developed a novel method to overcome this difficulty based on haptic feedback calibration, using a touchscreen in front of the robot that provides information on the EE position in the real environment. During the calibration procedure, the robot touches specific points on the screen, and the information is stored. In the next stage, we build a transformation function from the data based on linear transformation and neural networks that is capable of outputting all missing variables from any partial input (simulated/real joint/EE position). Our results demonstrate that a fully nonlinear neural network model performs best, significantly reducing positioning errors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-based 3D mapping suffers from cumulative drift causing global misalignment, particularly in GNSS-constrained environments. To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144{,}000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. Our method reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32\,m to 1.24\,m, achieving a 61.4\% improvement. The constructed high-fidelity map supports a wide range of applications, including smart city planning, geospatial data integration, infrastructure monitoring, and GPS-free navigation. Our method, and dataset together establish a new benchmark for evaluating 3D city mapping in GNSS-constrained environments. The dataset and code will be released publicly.

  Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However, traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures. The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite attitude control.

  Considerable advancements have been achieved in SLAM methods tailored for structured environments, yet their robustness under challenging corner cases remains a critical limitation. Although multi-sensor fusion approaches integrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the research community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of standardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM algorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive performance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks primarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively addressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental conditions.To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce M3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation patterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS denial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on M3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under challenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular multi-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust performance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and wheel odometry. Codes and datasets are publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a GNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving reliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration enables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from vehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing methods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or precise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in practice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability issues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless extrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the GINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external targets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the known installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable calibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is developed to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by integrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and motion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR configurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor setups.

  Humanoid robots show significant potential in daily tasks. However, reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body trajectory tracking.

  Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in robotic procedural planning, yet their human-centric reasoning often omits the low-level, grounded details needed for robotic execution. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a path toward more perceptually grounded plans, but current methods either rely on expensive, large-scale models or are constrained to narrow simulation settings. We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable self-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning. SelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify their own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing inspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms. Through this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality, execution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued fine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that SelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also outperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream embodied tasks.

  Obstacle avoidance is crucial for mobile robots' navigation in both known and unknown environments. This research designs, trains, and tests two custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using color and depth images from a depth camera as inputs. Both networks adopt sensor fusion to produce an output: the mobile robot's angular velocity, which serves as the robot's steering command. A newly obtained visual dataset for navigation was collected in diverse environments with varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles. During data collection, a communication link was established over Wi-Fi between a remote server and the robot, using Robot Operating System (ROS) topics. Velocity commands were transmitted from the server to the robot, enabling synchronized recording of visual data and the corresponding steering commands. Various evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error, Variance Score, and Feed-Forward time, provided a clear comparison between the two networks and clarified which one to use for the application.

  Our Robust, Explainable Autonomy for Scientific Icy Moon Operations (REASIMO) effort contributes to NASA's Concepts for Ocean worlds Life Detection Technology (COLDTech) program, which explores science platform technologies for ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Ocean world missions pose significant operational challenges. These include long communication lags, limited power, and lifetime limitations caused by radiation damage and hostile conditions. Given these operational limitations, onboard autonomy will be vital for future Ocean world missions. Besides the management of nominal lander operations, onboard autonomy must react appropriately in the event of anomalies. Traditional spacecraft rely on a transition into 'safe-mode' in which non-essential components and subsystems are powered off to preserve safety and maintain communication with Earth. For a severely time-limited Ocean world mission, resolutions to these anomalies that can be executed without Earth-in-the-loop communication and associated delays are paramount for completion of the mission objectives and science goals. To address these challenges, the REASIMO effort aims to demonstrate a robust level of AI-assisted autonomy for such missions, including the ability to detect and recover from anomalies, and to perform missions based on pre-trained behaviors rather than hard-coded, predetermined logic like all prior space missions. We developed an AI-assisted, personality-driven, intelligent framework for control of an Ocean world mission by combining a mix of advanced technologies. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we perform tests of autonomous sampling operations on a lander-manipulator testbed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, approximating possible surface conditions such a mission might encounter.

  Humanoid robots are drawing significant attention as versatile platforms for complex motor control, human-robot interaction, and general-purpose physical intelligence. However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and long-term list of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available atthis https URL.

  This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation modes. The concepts explored in our work have critical applications in ensuring safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.

  Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot systems domain given its applications in search & rescue and hazard localization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks) operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization (called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.

  In this paper, we introduce a multi-robot system that integrates mapping, localization, and task and motion planning (TAMP) enabled by 3D scene graphs to execute complex instructions expressed in natural language. Our system builds a shared 3D scene graph incorporating an open-set object-based map, which is leveraged for multi-robot 3D scene graph fusion. This representation supports real-time, view-invariant relocalization (via the object-based map) and planning (via the 3D scene graph), allowing a team of robots to reason about their surroundings and execute complex tasks. Additionally, we introduce a planning approach that translates operator intent into Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) goals using a Large Language Model (LLM) by leveraging context from the shared 3D scene graph and robot capabilities. We provide an experimental assessment of the performance of our system on real-world tasks in large-scale, outdoor environments. A supplementary video is available atthis https URL.

  Temporal alignment of multiple signals through time warping is crucial in many fields, such as classification within speech recognition or robot motion learning. Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space. Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions, a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce Riemannian Time Warping (RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification tasks.

  This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9% in low traffic density, +21% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

  Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous robot person-following (RPF) systems are crucial for personal assistance and security but suffer from target loss due to occlusions in dynamic, unknown environments. Current methods rely on pre-built maps and assume static environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world settings. There is a critical gap in re-finding targets under topographic (e.g., walls, corners) and dynamic (e.g., moving pedestrians) occlusions. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic-guided search framework that dynamically builds environmental maps while following the target and explicitly addresses these two types of occlusions through distinct mechanisms. For topographic occlusions, a belief-guided search field estimates the likelihood of the target's presence and guides search toward promising frontiers. For dynamic occlusions, an observation-based search strategy adaptively switches between a fluid-following field and an overtaking potential field based on occluder motion patterns. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of search efficiency and success rates, both in simulations and real-world tests. Our target search method enhances the adaptability and reliability of RPF systems in unknown and dynamic environments, supporting their use in real-world applications.

  This article studies the problem of distributed formation control for multiple robots by using onboard ultra wide band (UWB) distance and inertial odometer (IO) measurements.Although this problem has been widely studied, a fundamental limitation of most works is that they require each robot's pose and sensor measurements are expressed in a common reference frame.However, it is inapplicable for nonholonomic robot formations due to the practical difficulty of aligning IO measurements of individual robot in a common frame.To address this problem, firstly, a concurrent-learning based estimator is firstly proposed to achieve relative localization between neighboring robots in a local frame.Different from most relative localization methods in a global frame, both relative position and orientation in a local frame are estimated with only UWB ranging and IOmeasurements.Secondly, to deal with information loss caused by directed communication topology, a cooperative localization algorithm is introduced to estimate the relative pose to the leader robot.Thirdly, based on the theoretical results on relative pose estimation, a distributed formation tracking controller is proposed for nonholonomic robots.Both 3D and 2D real-world experiments conducted on aerial robots and grounded robots are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  We propose a globally consistent semantic SLAM system (GCSLAM) and a semantic-fusion localization subsystem (SF-Loc), which achieves accurate semantic mapping and robust localization in complex parking lots. Visual cameras (front-view and surround-view), IMU, and wheel encoder form the input sensor configuration of our system. The first part of our work is GCSLAM. GCSLAM introduces a semantic-constrained factor graph for the optimization of poses and semantic map, which incorporates innovative error terms based on multi-sensor data and BEV (bird's-eye view) semantic information. Additionally, GCSLAM integrates a Global Slot Management module that stores and manages parking slot observations. SF-Loc is the second part of our work, which leverages the semantic map built by GCSLAM to conduct map-based localization. SF-Loc integrates registration results and odometry poses with a novel factor graph. Our system demonstrates superior performance over existing SLAM on two real-world datasets, showing excellent capabilities in robust global localization and precise semantic mapping.
