- **[ChatThero: An LLM-Supported Chatbot for Behavior Change and Therapeutic Support in Addiction Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20996)**  `arXiv:2508.20996`  
  _Junda Wang, Zonghai Yao, Zhichao Yang, Lingxi Li, Junhui Qian, Hong Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research and clinical translation.

- **[A Graph-Based Test-Harness for LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20810)**  `arXiv:2508.20810`  
  _Jessica Lundin, Guillaume Chabot-Couture_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss. Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training (supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks. This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated, including when the guidelines are updated.

- **[Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)**  `arXiv:2508.20784`  
  _Yifan Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy, velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g., -430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop, real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

- **[Enhancing Health Fact-Checking with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20525)**  `arXiv:2508.20525`  
  _Jingze Zhang, Jiahe Qian, Yiliang Zhou, Yifan Peng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets, PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to 0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

- **[AWorld: Orchestrating the Training Recipe for Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20404)**  `arXiv:2508.20404`  
  _Chengyue Yu, Siyuan Lu, Chenyi Zhuang, Dong Wang, Qintong Wu, Zongyue Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node, sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

- **[Uncertainty Under the Curve: A Sequence-Level Entropy Area Metric for Reasoning LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20384)**  `arXiv:2508.20384`  
  _Yongfu Zhu, Lin Sun, Guangxiang Zhao, Weihong Lin, Xiangzheng Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets. In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets, improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training.

- **[TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)**  `arXiv:2508.20374`  
  _Simin Ma, Shujian Liu, Jun Tan, Yebowen Hu, Song Wang, Sathish Reddy Indurthi, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused applications.

- **[AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)**  `arXiv:2508.20368`  
  _Lang Mei, Zhihan Yang, Chong Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning. Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

- **[Do Students Rely on AI? Analysis of Student-ChatGPT Conversations from a Field Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20244)**  `arXiv:2508.20244`  
  _Jiayu Zheng, Lingxin Hao, Kelun Lu, Ashi Garg, Mike Reese, Melo-Jean Yap, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores how college students interact with generative AI (ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315 student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption, and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance. Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics, providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching AI practices.

- **[AI-AI Esthetic Collaboration with Explicit Semiotic Awareness and Emergent Grammar Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20195)**  `arXiv:2508.20195`  
  _Nicanor I. Moldovan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI) systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents with minor human supervision.

- **[IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)**  `arXiv:2508.20151`  
  _Yuanzhe Shen, Zisu Huang, Zhengkang Guo, Yide Liu, Guanxu Chen, Ruicheng Yin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries. Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

- **[ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)**  `arXiv:2508.20131`  
  _Yuqicheng Zhu, Nico Potyka, Daniel Hern√°ndez, Yuan He, Zifeng Ding, Bo Xiong, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving transparency.

- **[The Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine for Automated Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19200)**  `arXiv:2508.19200`  
  _Xinran Zhao, Boyuan Zheng, Chenglei Si, Haofei Yu, Ken Liu, Runlong Zhou, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

- **[RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18642)**  `arXiv:2508.18642`  
  _Jianxing Liao, Tian Zhang, Xiao Feng, Yusong Zhang, Rui Yang, Haorui Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing methods find it difficult to balance these two aspects: single reward strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation. Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both instruction following (IFEval from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

- **[MSARL: Decoupling Reasoning and Tool Use with Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08882)**  `arXiv:2508.08882`  
  _Dayu Wang, Jiaye Yang, Weikang Li, Jiahui Liang, Yang Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multi-agent systems highlight the potential of specialized small agents that collaborate via division of labor. Existing tool-integrated reasoning systems, however, often follow a single-agent paradigm in which one large model interleaves long-horizon reasoning with precise tool operations, leading to cognitive-load interference and unstable coordination. We present MSARL, a Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework that explicitly decouples reasoning from tool use. In MSARL, a Reasoning Agent decomposes problems and plans tool invocations, while multiple Tool Agents specialize in specific external tools, each trained via a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning with role-specific rewards. On mathematical problem solving with code execution, MSARL significantly improves reasoning stability and final-answer accuracy over single-agent baselines. Moreover, the architecture generalizes to diverse tool-use tasks, demonstrating that cognitive-role decoupling with small agents is a scalable blueprint for multi-agent AI design.

- **[Can Large Language Models Develop Strategic Reasoning? Post-training Insights from Learning Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00726)**  `arXiv:2507.00726`  
  _Dongyoon Hwang, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo, Dongmin Park, Jongho Park_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess-a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome. The code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Technology as uncharted territory: Contextual integrity and the notion of AI as new ethical ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05130)**  `arXiv:2412.05130`  
  _Alexander Martin Mussgnug_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research illustrates how AI can be developed and deployed in a manner detached from the concrete social context of application. By abstracting from the contexts of AI application, practitioners also disengage from the distinct normative structures that govern them. Building upon Helen Nissenbaum's framework of contextual integrity, I illustrate how disregard for contextual norms can threaten the integrity of a context with often decisive ethical implications. I argue that efforts to promote responsible and ethical AI can inadvertently contribute to and seemingly legitimize this disregard for established contextual norms. Echoing a persistent undercurrent in technology ethics of understanding emerging technologies as uncharted moral territory, certain approaches to AI ethics can promote a notion of AI as a novel and distinct realm for ethical deliberation, norm setting, and virtue cultivation. This narrative of AI as new ethical ground, however, can come at the expense of practitioners, policymakers and ethicists engaging with already established norms and virtues that were gradually cultivated to promote successful and responsible practice within concrete social contexts. In response, I question the current narrow prioritization in AI ethics of moral innovation over moral preservation. Engaging also with emerging foundation models, I advocate for a moderately conservative approach to the ethics of AI that prioritizes the responsible and considered integration of AI within established social contexts and their respective normative structures.

- **[OptiMUS-0.3: Using Large Language Models to Model and Solve Optimization Problems at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19633)**  `arXiv:2407.19633`  
  _Ali AhmadiTeshnizi, Wenzhi Gao, Herman Brunborg, Shayan Talaei, Connor Lawless, Madeleine Udell_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimization problems are pervasive in sectors from manufacturing and distribution to healthcare. However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers because the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to formulate and solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems from their natural language descriptions. Our system is capable of developing mathematical models, writing and debugging solver code, evaluating the generated solutions, and improving efficiency and correctness of its model and code based on these evaluations. OptiMUS-0.3 utilizes a modular structure to process problems, allowing it to handle problems with long descriptions and complex data without long prompts. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS-0.3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than 22% and on hard datasets (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex problems) by more than 24%.

  _Ramazan Ali Bahrami, Ramin Yahyapour_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev, Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance. Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge in sentential RE.

  _Chen Chen, Yuchen Sun, Jiaxin Gao, Xueluan Gong, Qian Wang, Ziyao Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally, LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be cost-efficient and robust against adaptive backdoor attacks.

- **[STARE at the Structure: Steering ICL Exemplar Selection with Structural Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20944)**  `arXiv:2508.20944`  
  _Jiaqian Li, Qisheng Hu, Jing Li, Wenya Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning, adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA) framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods. Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset, and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

  _Benjamin Marie, Atsushi Fujita_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision. Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

  _Rohan Phanse, Yijie Zhou, Kejian Shi, Wencai Zhang, Yixin Liu, Yilun Zhao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs -- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

  Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text. One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our findings show that while changes in language and writing style can significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most promise.

  _Harethah Abu Shairah, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, George Turkiyyah, Bernard Ghanem_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper, we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple, fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions, demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning paradigms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles (counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future research in this space.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Vassiliy Cheremetiev, Quang Long Ho Ngo, Chau Ying Kot, Alina Elena Baia, Andrea Cavallaro_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

  _Stephen Meisenbacher, Maulik Chevli, Florian Matthes_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees. Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use tasks. Code and training recipes are available atthis https URL.

  _Ruiyi Yan, Yugo Murawaki_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against attacks.

  _Nelson Filipe Costa, Leila Kosseim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities. With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test set and training data.

  Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning. These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying question generation through content planning and varied expression. However, these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However, previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label (output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains (input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared to the existing works.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications, including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

  Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+ benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over 200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani) and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities, in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

  Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework (Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model (LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked misinformation.

  _Yucheng Ruan, Xiang Lan, Daniel J. Tan, Hairil Rizal Abdullah, Mengling Feng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs. Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

  We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28 representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names, plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows - capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion. Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code and data:this https URL.

  Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is a case solving technique based on experience in cases that have occurred before with the highest similarity. CBR is used to search for practical work titles. TF-IDF is applied to process the vectorization of each practical work title word and Cosine Similarity for the calculation of similarity values. This system can search either in the form of titles or keywords. The output of the system is the title of practical work and the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match score.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications , we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and development:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However, their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale, high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks, and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

- **[Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)**  `arXiv:2508.20395`  
  _Xu Guo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness. Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final decision.We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits. However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs, incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions, whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions. Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better align with human judgments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available atthis https URL, with models and datasets hosted in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically, allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently. Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

  _Rikuto Kotoge, Mai Nishimura, Jiaxin Ma_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models. However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization (DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

  The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows. By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as time synchronization and data exchange, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the integration through representative case studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B) with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items for K-12.

  Pretrained multilingual models exhibit the same social bias as models processing English texts. This systematic review analyzes emerging research that extends bias evaluation and mitigation approaches into multilingual and non-English contexts. We examine these studies with respect to linguistic diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

  We introduce {AraHealthQA 2025}, the {Comprehensive Arabic Health Question Answering Shared Task}, held in conjunction with {ArabicNLP 2025} (co-located with EMNLP 2025). This shared task addresses the paucity of high-quality Arabic medical QA resources by offering two complementary tracks: {MentalQA}, focusing on Arabic mental health Q\&A (e.g., anxiety, depression, stigma reduction), and {MedArabiQ}, covering broader medical domains such as internal medicine, pediatrics, and clinical decision making. Each track comprises multiple subtasks, evaluation datasets, and standardized metrics, facilitating fair benchmarking. The task was structured to promote modeling under realistic, multilingual, and culturally nuanced healthcare contexts. We outline the dataset creation, task design and evaluation framework, participation statistics, baseline systems, and summarize the overall outcomes. We conclude with reflections on the performance trends observed and prospects for future iterations in Arabic health QA.

  _Sheng Liu, Qiang Sheng, Danding Wang, Yang Li, Guang Yang, Juan Cao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in improving large language model (LLM) to refuse to answer malicious instructions, widely used LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where attackers generate instructions with distributions differing from safety alignment corpora. New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility.

  _Aritra Dutta, Swapnanil Mukherjee, Deepanway Ghosal, Somak Aditya_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Commonsense visual-question answering often hinges on knowledge that is missing from the image or the question. Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In Large Language Models (LLMs) generation, there exist knowledge conflicts and scenarios where parametric knowledge contradicts knowledge provided in the context. Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e. proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers. LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the robustness to social influence compared to Base models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems remains a core challenge of natural language processing (NLP), further complicated by the rise of large language models (LLMs) that aims to be general-purpose. Recently, large language models as judges (LLJs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional metrics, but their validity remains underexplored. This position paper argues that the current enthusiasm around LLJs may be premature, as their adoption has outpaced rigorous scrutiny of their reliability and validity as evaluators. Drawing on measurement theory from the social sciences, we identify and critically assess four core assumptions underlying the use of LLJs: their ability to act as proxies for human judgment, their capabilities as evaluators, their scalability, and their cost-effectiveness. We examine how each of these assumptions may be challenged by the inherent limitations of LLMs, LLJs, or current practices in NLG evaluation. To ground our analysis, we explore three applications of LLJs: text summarization, data annotation, and safety alignment. Finally, we highlight the need for more responsible evaluation practices in LLJs evaluation, to ensure that their growing role in the field supports, rather than undermines, progress in NLG.

  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer: they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

  Machine translation quality has steadily improved over the years, achieving near-perfect translations in recent benchmarks. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement. In this context, automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future research.In this work, we address this gap by formalizing the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging benchmarks for machine translation. Our results show that dedicated models outperform both heuristic-based methods and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, with Sentinel-src achieving the best performance. Thus, we release two improved models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we employ a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), this method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.

  From professional research to everyday planning, many tasks are bottlenecked by wide-scale information seeking, which is more repetitive than cognitively complex. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), automated search agents powered by LLMs offer a promising solution to liberate humans from this tedious work. However, the capability of these agents to perform such "wide-context" collection reliably and completely remains largely unevaluated due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce WideSearch, a new benchmark engineered to evaluate agent reliability on these large-scale collection tasks. The benchmark features 200 manually curated questions (100 in English, 100 in Chinese) from over 15 diverse domains, grounded in real user queries. Each task requires agents to collect large-scale atomic information, which could be verified one by one objectively, and arrange it into a well-organized output. A rigorous five-stage quality control pipeline ensures the difficulty, completeness, and verifiability of the dataset. We benchmark over 10 state-of-the-art agentic search systems, including single-agent, multi-agent frameworks, and end-to-end commercial systems. Most systems achieve overall success rates near 0\%, with the best performer reaching just 5\%. However, given sufficient time, cross-validation by multiple human testers can achieve a near 100\% success rate. These results demonstrate that present search agents have critical deficiencies in large-scale information seeking, underscoring urgent areas for future research and development in agentic search.

  The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in many applications marks a significant advance in research and practice. However, their complexity and hard-to-understand nature make them vulnerable to attacks, especially jailbreaks designed to produce harmful responses. To counter these threats, developing strong detection methods is essential for the safe and reliable use of LLMs. This paper studies this detection problem using the Contextual Co-occurrence Matrix, a structure recognized for its efficacy in data-scarce environments. We propose a novel method leveraging the latent space characteristics of Contextual Co-occurrence Matrices and Tensors for the effective identification of adversarial and jailbreak prompts. Our evaluations show that this approach achieves a notable F1 score of 0.83 using only 0.5% of labeled prompts, which is a 96.6% improvement over baselines. This result highlights the strength of our learned patterns, especially when labeled data is scarce. Our method is also significantly faster, speedup ranging from 2.3 to 128.4 times compared to the baseline models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

  Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models. Code available atthis https URL.

  Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability, compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART} (\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent \textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically, DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM) to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART offers significant performance gains compared with existing non-autoregressive baselines without extra inference latency, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in sentence-level machine translation, but scaling to document-level translation remains challenging, particularly in modeling long-range dependencies and discourse phenomena across sentences and paragraphs. In this work, we propose a method to improve LLM-based long-document translation through targeted fine-tuning on high-quality document-level data, which we curate and introduce as DocBlocks. Our approach supports multiple translation paradigms, including direct document-to-document and chunk-level translation, by integrating instructions both with and without surrounding context. This enables models to better capture cross-sentence dependencies while maintaining strong sentence-level translation performance. Experimental results show that incorporating multiple translation paradigms improves document-level translation quality and inference speed compared to prompting and agent-based methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The primary goal of a news headline is to summarize an event in as few words as possible. Depending on the media outlet, a headline can serve as a means to objectively deliver a summary or improve its visibility. For the latter, specific publications may employ stylistic approaches that incorporate the use of sarcasm, irony, and exaggeration, key elements of a satirical approach. As such, even the headline must reflect the tone of the satirical main content. Current approaches for the Romanian language tend to detect the non-conventional tone (i.e., satire and clickbait) of the news content by combining both the main article and the headline. Because we consider a headline to be merely a brief summary of the main article, we investigate in this paper the presence of satirical tone in headlines alone, testing multiple baselines ranging from standard machine learning algorithms to deep learning models. Our experiments show that Bidirectional Transformer models outperform both standard machine-learning approaches and Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly when the meta-learning Reptile approach is employed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable, these capabilities are unevenly distributed: they excel at formal linguistic tasks, such as producing fluent, grammatical text, but struggle more with functional linguistic tasks like reasoning and consistent fact retrieval. Inspired by neuroscience, recent work suggests that to succeed on both formal and functional linguistic tasks, LLMs should use different mechanisms for each; such localization could either be built-in or emerge spontaneously through training. In this paper, we ask: do current models, with fast-improving functional linguistic abilities, exhibit distinct localization of formal and functional linguistic mechanisms? We answer this by finding and comparing the "circuits", or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various formal and functional tasks. Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that while there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional tasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists in the human brain. Thus, a single formal linguistic network, unified and distinct from functional task circuits, remains elusive. However, in terms of cross-task faithfulness - the ability of one circuit to solve another's task - we observe a separation between formal and functional mechanisms, suggesting that shared mechanisms between formal tasks may exist.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parallel Data Curation (PDC) techniques aim to filter out noisy parallel sentences from the web-mined corpora. Prior research has demonstrated that ranking sentence pairs using similarity scores on sentence embeddings derived from Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models (multiPLMs) and training the NMT systems with the top-ranked samples, produces superior NMT performance than when trained using the full dataset. However, previous research has shown that the choice of multiPLM significantly impacts the ranking quality. This paper investigates the reasons behind this disparity across multiPLMs. Using the web-mined corpora CCMatrix and CCAligned for En$\rightarrow$Si, En$\rightarrow$Ta and Si$\rightarrow$Ta, we show that different multiPLMs (LASER3, XLM-R, and LaBSE) are biased towards certain types of sentences, which allows noisy sentences to creep into the top-ranked samples. We show that by employing a series of heuristics, this noise can be removed to a certain extent. This results in improving the results of NMT systems trained with web-mined corpora and reduces the disparity across multiPLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, notably degrading the safety of originally aligned models. While some existing methods attempt to restore safety by incorporating additional safety data, the quality of such data typically falls short of that used in the original alignment process. Moreover, these high-quality safety datasets are generally inaccessible, making it difficult to fully recover the model's original safety. We ask: How can we preserve safety while improving downstream task performance without additional safety data? We show that simply merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned models effectively mitigates safety degradation while enhancing performance. Experiments across different downstream tasks and models validate the method's practicality and effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The best-performing approaches for scholarly document quality prediction are based on embedding models. In addition to their performance when used in classifiers, embedding models can also provide predictions even for words that were not contained in the labelled training data for the classification model, which is important in the context of the ever-evolving research terminology. Although model-agnostic explanation methods, such as Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, can be applied to explain machine learning classifiers trained on embedding models, these produce results with questionable correspondence to the model. We introduce a new feature importance method, Self-model Rated Entities (SMER), for logistic regression-based classification models trained on word embeddings. We show that SMER has theoretically perfect fidelity with the explained model, as the average of logits of SMER scores for individual words (SMER explanation) exactly corresponds to the logit of the prediction of the explained model. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation is performed through five diverse experiments conducted on 50,000 research articles (papers) from the CORD-19 corpus. Through an AOPC curve analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that SMER produces better explanations than LIME, SHAP and global tree surrogates.

  _Arief Purnama Muharram, Ayu Purwarianti_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.

  Decoder-only large language models typically rely solely on masked causal attention, which limits their expressiveness by restricting information flow to one direction. We propose Bitune, a method that enhances pretrained decoder-only LLMs by incorporating bidirectional attention into prompt processing. We evaluate Bitune in instruction-tuning and question-answering settings, showing significant improvements in performance on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and language understanding tasks. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies validate the role of each component of the method, and demonstrate that Bitune is compatible with various parameter-efficient finetuning techniques and full model finetuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task stem from (1) the distribution variance in the LLM activations and (2) the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.

  Language embeds information about social, cultural, and political values people hold. Prior work has explored social and potentially harmful biases encoded in Pre-Trained Language models (PTLMs). However, there has been no systematic study investigating how values embedded in these models vary across cultures. In this paper, we introduce probes to study which values across cultures are embedded in these models, and whether they align with existing theories and cross-cultural value surveys. We find that PTLMs capture differences in values across cultures, but those only weakly align with established value surveys. We discuss implications of using mis-aligned models in cross-cultural settings, as well as ways of aligning PTLMs with value surveys.

  Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge. The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track, depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain. Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the development of more robust image watermarking methods.

  We present Dress&Dance, a video diffusion framework that generates high quality 5-second-long 24 FPS virtual try-on videos at 1152x720 resolution of a user wearing desired garments while moving in accordance with a given reference video. Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops, bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.

  In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model. By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives. We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across multiple evaluation dimensions.

  We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively. Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world applications.

  Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens, forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) introduces action intent into the language model by pruning instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold compared to OpenVLA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically, we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples. Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations. First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second, they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

  Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25 challenge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency, we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models, where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of large-scale text-to-image generation.

  The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences. Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models. To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii) conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining competitive performance.

  Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods, offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization. Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for realistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic autonomous driving scenes. DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using incremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite dynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By integrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction and photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs) and controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object motion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process. DrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and generates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing scene diversity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy performance under different complexity configurations. The three core innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at 0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization capability.

  In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications.

  Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading. Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult, as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific metrics but requires further research.

  Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow. We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust, generalizable, and interpretable perception.

  _Pushkar Shukla_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution (LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular, training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation.

  Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.

  Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives, these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will be publicly available inthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization. To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition, Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets, indicating the clinical applicability of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations. To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models -- Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:this https URL

  Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers.

  The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation models.

  Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.

  _Jiawen Lin, Shiran Bian, Yihang Zhu, Wenbin Tan, Yachao Zhang, Yuan Xie, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements. However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world applicability.

  _Yuxi Hu, Jun Zhang, Kuangyi Chen, Zhe Zhang, Friedrich Fraundorfer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters, enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens when minimal score differences between images are amplified after normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM, and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences, providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally, existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20 subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

  Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2. The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities. Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods, indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off. Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and bitrate-constrained applications.

  Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (this https URL) and the data generation code (this https URL). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence. We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after" paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order. Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

  Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians, offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent, and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are ineffective. Paper page atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training, effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

  Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection, particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers, acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase atthis https URL.

  Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling, emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:this https URL

  In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML) models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples. In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising results to optimize the defect localization process.

  Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS) offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ, which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate 3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance intraoperative guidance.

  Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text. Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in text consistency.

  Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation, reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

  The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

  Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.

  Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance, and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines. Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

  Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes, making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images. Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch (CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating consistent performance gains.

  Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557 simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective adaptation of models to medical data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from 25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views. This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training, filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source contributions.

  _Mingqian Ji, Jian Yang, Shanshan Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space, while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness. Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods.

  The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake of novel view quality is the most important.

  _Wenting Yin, Han Sun, Xinru Meng, Ningzhong Liu, Huiyu Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning. This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation scenarios.

  Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it improves editing accuracy and consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models. However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial: existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate, underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

  Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers' shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot. CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore, based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference. While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD. Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.

  Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous. Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects. Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

  Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However, this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities. Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand, videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead. Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding. This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization.

  We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

  With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques, forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across applications like video conferencing and social media. Although state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency, with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views. Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

  In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network (DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets, especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks. Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort, motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated. Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving state-of-the-art results.

In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio, where text-only approaches fail.

  Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture, BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, \emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its state-of-the-art competitors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks. We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS) enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

  _Zhuoran Yu, Yong Jae Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP.In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network, for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of 0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature. The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG). MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high accuracy in PVS segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach. Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated: Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis, southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to 95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

  Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments, addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking, demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos.

  Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts, and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled, resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made public.

  Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice. To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g., lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

  Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localizationthis http URLleverage the multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance. Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3, thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image. Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were entirely unseen during training.

  In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis.

  Large video language models (LVLMs) have made notable progress in video understanding, spurring the development of corresponding evaluation benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences.

  Compositional Customized Image Generation aims to customize multiple target concepts within generation content, which has gained attention for its wild application. Existing approaches mainly concentrate on the target entity's appearance preservation, while neglecting the fine-grained interaction control among target entities. To enable the model of such interaction control capability, we focus on human object interaction scenario and propose the task of Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation(CHOI), which simultaneously requires identity preservation for target human object and the interaction semantic control between them. Two primary challenges exist for CHOI:(1)simultaneous identity preservation and interaction control demands require the model to decompose the human object into self-contained identity features and pose-oriented interaction features, while the current HOI image datasets fail to provide ideal samples for such feature-decomposed learning.(2)inappropriate spatial configuration between human and object may lead to the lack of desired interaction semantics. To tackle it, we first process a large-scale dataset, where each sample encompasses the same pair of human object involving different interactive poses. Then we design a two-stage model Interact-Custom, which firstly explicitly models the spatial configuration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction behavior, then under the guidance of this mask, we generate the target human object interacting while preserving their identities features. Furthermore, if the background image and the union location of where the target human object should appear are provided by users, Interact-Custom also provides the optional functionality to specify them, offering high content controllability. Extensive experiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across multiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life records), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across dynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks, compared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing multi-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generation MLLMs. The data and evaluation code are available atthis https URL.

  Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with heavy computational cost and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.

  Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants - text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR - across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the "concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to enable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

  We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron (MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option for HCR.

  This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89 percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with interpretable, hand-engineered features.

  Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders. This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with high-quality research acquisitions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.

  Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA) models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However, existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into 10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally, fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for VideoQA. InterAct VideoQA is publicly available as a benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in real-world deployable VideoQA models for intelligent transportation systems. GitHub Repo:this https URL

  The latest developments in Face Restoration have yielded significant advancements in visual quality through the utilization of diverse diffusion priors. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of face identity introduced by identity-obscure inputs and stochastic generative processes remains unresolved. To address this challenge, we present Robust ID-Specific Face Restoration (RIDFR), a novel ID-specific face restoration framework based on diffusion models. Specifically, RIDFR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model in conjunction with two parallel conditioning modules. The Content Injection Module inputs the severely degraded image, while the Identity Injection Module integrates the specific identity from a given image. Subsequently, RIDFR incorporates Alignment Learning, which aligns the restoration results from multiple references with the same identity in order to suppress the interference of ID-irrelevant face semantics (e.g. pose, expression, make-up, hair style). Experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, reconstructing high-quality ID-specific results with high identity fidelity and demonstrating strong robustness.

  This paper addresses the task of assessing PICU team's leadership skills by developing an automated analysis framework based on egocentric vision. We identify key behavioral cues, including fixation object, eye contact, and conversation patterns, as essential indicators of leadership assessment. In order to capture these multimodal signals, we employ Aria Glasses to record egocentric video, audio, gaze, and head movement data. We collect one-hour videos of four simulated sessions involving doctors with different roles and levels. To automate data processing, we propose a method leveraging REMoDNaV, SAM, YOLO, and ChatGPT for fixation object detection, eye contact detection, and conversation classification. In the experiments, significant correlations are observed between leadership skills and behavioral metrics, i.e., the output of our proposed methods, such as fixation time, transition patterns, and direct orders in speech. These results indicate that our proposed data collection and analysis framework can effectively solve skill assessment for training PICU teams.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance. AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to a similar area in the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that form the drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of teaching vision-language models a subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality representations.

  Recent advances in generative AI have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning generative models, existing methods like DDPO and DPOK face fundamental limitations - particularly their inability to maintain stable optimization when scaling to large and diverse prompt sets, severely restricting their practical utility. This paper presents DanceGRPO, a framework that addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for visual generation tasks. Our key insight is that GRPO's inherent stability mechanisms uniquely position it to overcome the optimization challenges that plague prior RL-based approaches on visual generation. DanceGRPO establishes several significant advances: First, it demonstrates consistent and stable policy optimization across multiple modern generative paradigms, including both diffusion models and rectified flows. Second, it maintains robust performance when scaling to complex, real-world scenarios encompassing three key tasks and four foundation models. Third, it shows remarkable versatility in optimizing for diverse human preferences as captured by five distinct reward models assessing image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary feedback. Our comprehensive experiments reveal that DanceGRPO outperforms baseline methods by up to 181\% across multiple established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

  We introduce GeoTexBuild, a modular generative framework for creating 3D building models from footprints derived from site planning or map designs. The system is designed for architects and city planners, offering a seamless solution that directly converts map features into 3D buildings. The proposed framework employs a three-stage process comprising height map generation, geometry reconstruction, and appearance stylization, culminating in building models with detailed geometry and appearance attributes. By integrating customized ControlNet, Neural style field (NSF), and Multi-view diffusion model, we explore effective methods for controlling both geometric and visual attributes during the generation process. Our approach eliminates the problem of structural variations in a single facade image in existing 3D generation techniques for buildings. Experimental results at each stage validate the capability of GeoTexBuild to generate detailed and accurate building models from footprints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most 3D object generators prioritize aesthetic quality, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for practical applications. One such constraint is that a 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remain balanced under gravity. Previous approaches to generating stable 3D objects relied on differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models with external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO). This framework leverages feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator directly outputs stable 3D objects. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with stability scores obtained from the physics simulator. This dataset enables fine-tuning of the 3D generator using the stability score as an alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO) - a novel objective we introduce to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either the DPO or DRO objective, is significantly faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework functions even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.

  Knowledge discovery and collection are intelligence-intensive tasks that traditionally require significant human effort to ensure high-quality outputs. Recent research has explored multi-agent frameworks for automating Wikipedia-style article generation by retrieving and synthesizing information from the internet. However, these methods primarily focus on text-only generation, overlooking the importance of multimodal content in enhancing informativeness and engagement. In this work, we introduce WikiAutoGen, a novel system for automated multimodal Wikipedia-style article generation. Unlike prior approaches, WikiAutoGen retrieves and integrates relevant images alongside text, enriching both the depth and visual appeal of generated content. To further improve factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective self-reflection mechanism, which critically assesses retrieved content from diverse viewpoints to enhance reliability, breadth, and coherence, etc. Additionally, we introduce WikiSeek, a benchmark comprising Wikipedia articles with topics paired with both textual and image-based representations, designed to evaluate multimodal knowledge generation on more challenging topics. Experimental results show that WikiAutoGen outperforms previous methods by 8%-29% on our WikiSeek benchmark, producing more accurate, coherent, and visually enriched Wikipedia-style articles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured under varying lighting conditions, which has drawn intensive research attention and achieved promising results. However, existing methods adopt the centralized training, ignoring the potential privacy concerns as the data is distributed across multiple devices or entities in reality. In this paper, we propose L2RW+, a benchmark that brings VI-ReID closer to real-world applications. The core rationale behind L2RW+ is that incorporating decentralized training into VI-ReID can address privacy concerns in scenarios with limited data-sharing constrains. Specifically, we design protocols and corresponding algorithms for different privacy sensitivity levels. In our new benchmark, we simulate the training under real-world data conditions that: 1) data from each camera is completely isolated, or 2) different data entities (e.g., data controllers of a certain region) can selectively share the data. In this way, we simulate scenarios with strict privacy restrictions, which is closer to real-world conditions. Comprehensive experiments show the feasibility and potential of decentralized VI-ReID training at both image and video levels. In particular, with increasing data scales, the performance gap between decentralized and centralized training decreases, especially in video-level VI-ReID. In unseen domains, decentralized training even achieves performance comparable to SOTA centralized methods. This work offers a novel research entry for deploying VI-ReID into real-world scenarios and can benefit the community. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Cross-Modality Generation Models (GMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks. Given the ubiquity and information richness of vision modality inputs in real-world scenarios, Cross-Vision tasks, encompassing Vision-Language Perception (VLP) and Image-to-Image (I2I), have attracted significant attention. Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and I2I Generation Models (GMs) are employed to handle VLP and I2I tasks, respectively. Previous research indicates that printing typographic words into input images significantly induces LVLMs and I2I GMs to produce disruptive outputs that are semantically aligned with those words. Additionally, visual prompts, as a more sophisticated form of typography, are also revealed to pose security risks to various applications of cross-vision tasks. However, the specific characteristics of the threats posed by visual prompts remain underexplored. In this paper, to comprehensively investigate the performance impact induced by Typographic Visual Prompt Injection (TVPI) in various LVLMs and I2I GMs, we propose the Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Dataset and thoroughly evaluate the TVPI security risks on various open-source and closed-source LVLMs and I2I GMs under visual prompts with different target semantics, deepening the understanding of TVPI threats.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training visual reinforcement learning (RL) in practical scenarios presents a significant challenge, $\textit{i.e.,}$ RL agents suffer from low sample efficiency in environments with variations. While various approaches have attempted to alleviate this issue by disentangled representation learning, these methods usually start learning from scratch without prior knowledge of the world. This paper, in contrast, tries to learn and understand underlying semantic variations from distracting videos via offline-to-online latent distillation and flexible disentanglement constraints. To enable effective cross-domain semantic knowledge transfer, we introduce an interpretable model-based RL framework, dubbed Disentangled World Models (DisWM). Specifically, we pretrain the action-free video prediction model offline with disentanglement regularization to extract semantic knowledge from distracting videos. The disentanglement capability of the pretrained model is then transferred to the world model through latent distillation. For finetuning in the online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and introduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model. During the adaptation phase, the incorporation of actions and rewards from online environment interactions enriches the diversity of the data, which in turn strengthens the disentangled representation learning. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach on various benchmarks.

  The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation and has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting different diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used primarily in a centralized approach where the collected data is stored in the same location where nnU-Net is trained. This centralized approach has various limitations, such as potential leakage of sensitive patient information and violation of patient privacy. Federated learning has emerged as a key approach for training segmentation models in a decentralized manner, enabling collaborative development while prioritising patient privacy. In this paper, we propose FednnU-Net, a plug-and-play, federated learning extension of the nnU-Net framework. To this end, we contribute two federated methodologies to unlock decentralized training of nnU-Net, namely, Federated Fingerprint Extraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg). We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrating high and consistent performance of our methods for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation based on a multi-modal collection of 6 datasets representing samples from 18 different institutions. To democratize research as well as real-world deployments of decentralized training in clinical centres, we publicly share our framework atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D visual grounding (3DVG) is challenging due to the need to understand 3D spatial relations. While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high annotation costs of 3D vision-language datasets. Training-free approaches based on LLMs/VLMs eliminate the need for large-scale training data, but they either incur prohibitive grounding time and token costs or have unsatisfactory accuracy. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel method for training-free 3D visual grounding, namely Language-to-Space Programming (LaSP). LaSP introduces LLM-generated codes to analyze 3D spatial relations among objects, along with a pipeline that evaluates and optimizes the codes automatically. Experimental results demonstrate that LaSP achieves 52.9% accuracy on the Nr3D benchmark, ranking among the best training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the grounding time and token costs, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Creating advertising images is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Can we automatically generate such images using basic product information like a product foreground image, taglines, and a target size? Existing methods mainly focus on parts of the problem and lack a comprehensive solution. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel product-centric framework for advertising image design called T-Stars-Poster. It consists of four sequential stages to highlight product foregrounds and taglines while achieving overall image aesthetics: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are designed and trained for the first three stages: First, a visual language model (VLM) generates background prompts that match the products. Next, a VLM-based layout generation model arranges the placement of product foregrounds, graphic elements (taglines and decorative underlays), and various nongraphic elements (objects from the background prompt). Following this, an SDXL-based model can simultaneously accept prompts, layouts, and foreground controls to generate images. To support T-Stars-Poster, we create two corresponding datasets with over 50,000 labeled images. Extensive experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that T-Stars-Poster can produce more visually appealing advertising images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.

  The recent segmentation foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), exhibits strong zero-shot segmentation capabilities, but it falls short in generating fine-grained precise masks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot image matting model, called ZIM, with two key contributions: First, we develop a label converter that transforms segmentation labels into detailed matte labels, constructing the new SA1B-Matte dataset without costly manual annotations. Training SAM with this dataset enables it to generate precise matte masks while maintaining its zero-shot capability. Second, we design the zero-shot matting model equipped with a hierarchical pixel decoder to enhance mask representation, along with a prompt-aware masked attention mechanism to improve performance by enabling the model to focus on regions specified by visual prompts. We evaluate ZIM using the newly introduced MicroMat-3K test set, which contains high-quality micro-level matte labels. Experimental results show that ZIM outperforms existing methods in fine-grained mask generation and zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of ZIM in various downstream tasks requiring precise masks, such as image inpainting and 3D NeRF. Our contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing zero-shot matting and its downstream applications across a wide range of computer vision tasks. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While many diffusion models perform well when controlling particular aspects such as style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel training-free algorithm, independent of denoising network architectures, for fine-grained generation, called Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM). The algorithm integrates features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate particular features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional generation in diffusion models. Specifically, it allows us to fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs. Code is available at:this https URL.

  In the digital era, the ability to understand visually rich documents that integrate text, complex layouts, and imagery is critical. Traditional Key Information Extraction (KIE) methods primarily rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which often introduces significant latency, computational overhead, and errors. Current advanced image-to-text approaches, which bypass OCR, typically yield plain text outputs without corresponding vision grounding. In this paper, we introduce STNet (See then Tell Net), a novel end-to-end model designed to deliver precise answers with relevant vision grounding. Distinctively, STNet utilizes a unique <see> token to observe pertinent image areas, aided by a decoder that interprets physical coordinates linked to this token. Positioned at the outset of the answer text, the <see> token allows the model to first see-observing the regions of the image related to the input question-and then tell-providing articulated textual responses. To enhance the model's seeing capabilities, we collect extensive structured table recognition datasets. Leveraging the advanced text processing prowess of GPT-4, we develop the TVG (TableQA with Vision Grounding) dataset, which not only provides text-based Question Answering (QA) pairs but also incorporates precise vision grounding for these pairs. Our approach demonstrates substantial advancements in KIE performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets such as CORD, SROIE, and DocVQA. The code will also be made publicly available.

  _Ruining Li, Chuanxia Zheng, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Puppet-Master, an interactive video generator that captures the internal, part-level motion of objects, serving as a proxy for modeling object dynamics universally. Given an image of an object and a set of "drags" specifying the trajectory of a few points on the object, the model synthesizes a video where the object's parts move accordingly. To build Puppet-Master, we extend a pre-trained image-to-video generator to encode the input drags. We also propose all-to-first attention, an alternative to conventional spatial attention that mitigates artifacts caused by fine-tuning a video generator on out-of-domain data. The model is fine-tuned on Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips obtained by rendering synthetic 3D animations. Unlike real videos, these synthetic clips avoid confounding part-level motion with overall object and camera motion. We extensively filter sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful drags that emphasize the internal dynamics of objects. We demonstrate that Puppet-Master learns to generate part-level motions, unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that primarily move the object as a whole. Moreover, Puppet-Master generalizes well to out-of-domain real images, outperforming existing methods on real-world benchmarks in a zero-shot manner.

  We present VLMEvalKit: an open-source toolkit for evaluating large multi-modality models based on PyTorch. The toolkit aims to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive framework for researchers and developers to evaluate existing multi-modality models and publish reproducible evaluation results. In VLMEvalKit, we implement over 200+ different large multi-modality models, including both proprietary APIs and open-source models, as well as more than 80 different multi-modal benchmarks. By implementing a single interface, new models can be easily added to the toolkit, while the toolkit automatically handles the remaining workloads, including data preparation, distributed inference, prediction post-processing, and metric calculation. Although the toolkit is currently mainly used for evaluating large vision-language models, its design is compatible with future updates that incorporate additional modalities, such as audio and video. Based on the evaluation results obtained with the toolkit, we host OpenVLM Leaderboard, a comprehensive leaderboard to track the progress of multi-modality learning research. The toolkit is released onthis https URLand is actively maintained.

  _Md Shazid Islam, Sayak Nag, Arindam Dutta, Miraj Ahmed, Fahim Faisal Niloy, Shreyangshu Bera, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation typically relies on self-training using pseudo labels predicted by a pre-trained network on an unlabeled target dataset. However, the noisy nature of such pseudo-labels presents a major bottleneck in adapting a network to the distribution shift between source and target datasets. This challenge is exaggerated when the network encounters an incoming data stream in online fashion, where the network is constrained to adapt to incoming streams of target domain data in exactly one round of forward and backward passes. In this scenario, relying solely on inaccurate pseudo-labels can lead to low-quality segmentation, which is detrimental to medical image analysis where accuracy and precision are of utmost priority. We hypothesize that a small amount of pixel-level annotation obtained from an expert can address this problem, thereby enhancing the performance of domain adaptation of online streaming data, even in the absence of dedicated training data. We call our method ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation that adapts to each incoming data batch in an online setup, incorporating feedback from an expert through active learning. Through active learning, the most informative pixels in each image can be selected for expert annotation. However, the acquisition of pixel-level annotations across all images in a batch often leads to redundant information while increasing temporal overhead in online learning. To reduce the annotation acquisition time and make the adaptation process more online-friendly, we further propose a novel image-pruning strategy that selects the most useful subset of images from the current batch for active learning. Our proposed approach outperforms existing online adaptation approaches and produces competitive results compared to offline domain adaptive active learning methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.

  Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences, compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering. Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG is publicly available at the Github:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI) enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

  _Yaniv Hassidof, Tom Jurgenson, Kiril Solovey_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs. DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed. However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone. Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover, after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph machine learning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results, our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06 compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks, but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs, preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem, converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps: transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and (b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

  _Anirudh Satheesh, Keenan Powell, Hua Wei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL) addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts. Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code atthis https URL.

  We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks, particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty, RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability. Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general defense.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles. Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to training on original data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable, accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine learning applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced /va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF) classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis through scalable, self-supervised learning.

  _Tuƒürul Hasan Karabulut, ƒ∞nci M. Bayta≈ü_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However, gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus, the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve performance on graph and node classification tasks.

  Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights. Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures. Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2 models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens. This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The article discusses the concept of hyperparametric optimization of recommendation algorithms using an integral assessment that combines various performance indicators into a single consolidated criterion. This approach is opposed to traditional methods of setting up a single metric and allows you to achieve a balance between accuracy, ranking quality, variety of output and the resource intensity of algorithms. The theoretical significance of the research lies in the development of a universal multi-criteria optimization tool that is applicable not only in recommendation systems, but also in a wide range of machine learning and data analysis tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.

  _Haiyan Wang, Ye Yuan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR. However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

  Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets, revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their evaluation in realistic scenarios.

  _Zhihao Liu, Jian Lou, Yuke Hu, Xiaochen Li, Tailun Chen, Yitian Chen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of degraded utility.In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on very large datasets as PathX-256.

  _Michael Widener, Kausik Lakkaraju, John Aydin, Biplav Srivastava_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences. Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy, transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power, car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

  _Zhongpan Tang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency}, \textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

  _Shijie Wang, Lei Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins, enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

  Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images, various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews, making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a single representation.This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production, achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase. The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural development and accelerate the design cycle.

  Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios, which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS, a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far more robust.The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a 'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization. In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical use of instance-level MIP embeddings atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations, often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data: WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW) data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical implications.

  The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient, sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals, autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems. Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA, and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks. The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL) remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me (ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

  _Frank R√∂der, Jan Benad, Manfred Eppe, Pradeep Kr. Banerjee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes (cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination (DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

  _Shihao Zhang, Rayan Saab_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid. Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios: one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation learning from latent inference.

  _Manish Nagaraj, Deepak Ravikumar, Kaushik Roy_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with <1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints, incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

  Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore, we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving superior performance.

  Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting (LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters, which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the full spectrum for forecasting.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in structured data modeling tasks such as node classification. However, mainstream approaches generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer. This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation learning. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the full implementation of SDGNN has been released at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Adam optimizer remains one of the most widely used optimizers in deep learning, and effectively tuning its hyperparameters is key to optimizing performance. However, tuning can be tedious and costly. Freeze-thaw Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a recent promising approach for low-budget hyperparameter tuning, but is limited by generic surrogates without prior knowledge of how hyperparameters affect learning. We propose Adam-PFN, a new surrogate model for Freeze-thaw BO of Adam's hyperparameters, pre-trained on learning curves from TaskSet, together with a new learning curve augmentation method, CDF-augment, which artificially increases the number of available training examples. Our approach improves both learning curve extrapolation and accelerates hyperparameter optimization on TaskSet evaluation tasks, with strong performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff, which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions to broader domains.

  _An Ning, Tai Yue Li, Nan Yow Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose the Quantum Graph Attention Network (QGAT), a hybrid graph neural network that integrates variational quantum circuits into the attention mechanism. At its core, QGAT employs strongly entangling quantum circuits with amplitude-encoded node features to enable expressive nonlinear interactions. Distinct from classical multi-head attention that separately computes each head, QGAT leverages a single quantum circuit to simultaneously generate multiple attention coefficients. This quantum parallelism facilitates parameter sharing across heads, substantially reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Classical projection weights and quantum circuit parameters are optimized jointly in an end-to-end manner, ensuring flexible adaptation to learning tasks. Empirical results demonstrate QGAT's effectiveness in capturing complex structural dependencies and improved generalization in inductive scenarios, highlighting its potential for scalable quantum-enhanced learning across domains such as chemistry, biology, and network analysis. Furthermore, experiments confirm that quantum embedding enhances robustness against feature and structural noise, suggesting advantages in handling real-world noisy data. The modularity of QGAT also ensures straightforward integration into existing architectures, allowing it to easily augment classical attention-based models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-pecific supervision remains challenging. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited by fixed label spaces, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack structural inductive biases. Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) provide a zero-shot alternative via explicit, long chain-of-thought reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a GNN-free approach that reformulates graph tasks--node classification, link prediction, and graph classification--as textual reasoning problems solved by LRMs. We introduce the first datasets with detailed reasoning traces for these tasks and develop Graph-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages task-specific rethink templates to guide reasoning over linearized graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Graph-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings, producing interpretable and effective predictions. Our work highlights the promise of explicit reasoning for graph learning and provides new resources for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

  Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals across different domains (i.e., datasets), often leading to poor generalization. This work proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a thorough ablation analysis of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code is publicly available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via Safe RL evaluated on real-world, human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and 50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

  Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial, task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$, respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model. Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS) method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling (RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method. Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS, respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful approach for automating neural network design. However, existing NAS methods face critical limitations in real-world deployments: architectures lack adaptability across scenarios, each deployment context requires costly separate searches, and performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs. Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. The Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) suggests these models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc detection of such alignment and explicitly optimize for it? We argue this challenge is most critical in fine-grained contextual distinctions-where multiple descriptions share global semantics but differ in subtle compositional details. We address this with the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM), which aligns frozen unimodal models by jointly training modality-specific autoencoders with coordinated reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. We systematically evaluate JAM across three design axes: (i) alignment objectives, introducing our multimodal Spread Loss that outperforms classic contrastive methods; (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective; and (iii) the role of foundation model scale in representational convergence. Our findings show that JAM reliably induces alignment even across independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight into the structure of shared semantics and practical guidance for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.

  Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 64% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench Lite, significantly outperforming the best alternative.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE), a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and promote modularization among the experts.

  Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page:this https URL.

  Guaranteeing constraint satisfaction is challenging in imitation learning (IL), particularly in tasks that require operating near a system's handling limits. Traditional IL methods, such as Behavior Cloning (BC), often struggle to enforce constraints, leading to suboptimal performance in high-precision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple approach to incorporating safety into the IL objective. Through simulations, we empirically validate our approach on an autonomous racing task with both full-state and image feedback, demonstrating improved constraint satisfaction and greater consistency in task performance compared to BC.

  Retrieving targeted pathways in biological knowledge bases, particularly when incorporating wet-lab experimental data, remains a challenging task and often requires downstream analyses and specialized expertise. In this paper, we frame this challenge as a solvable graph learning and explaining task and propose a novel subgraph inference framework, ExPAth, that explicitly integrates experimental data to classify various graphs (bio-networks) in biological databases. The links (representing pathways) that contribute more to classification can be considered as targeted pathways. Our framework can seamlessly integrate biological foundation models to encode the experimental molecular data. We propose ML-oriented biological evaluations and a new metric. The experiments involving 301 bio-networks evaluations demonstrate that pathways inferred by ExPath are biologically meaningful, achieving up to 4.5x higher Fidelity+ (necessity) and 14x lower Fidelity- (sufficiency) than explainer baselines, while preserving signaling chains up to 4x longer.

Toward upper bounds, we tighten a linear program relaxation by the class of odd closed walk inequalities that define facets, as we show, of the preorder polytope. We contribute implementations of the algorithms, apply these to the task of jointly clustering and partially ordering the accounts of published social networks, and compare the output and efficiency qualitatively and quantitatively.

  Existing machine learning literature lacks graph-based domain adaptation techniques capable of handling large distribution shifts, primarily due to the difficulty in simulating a coherent evolutionary path from source to target graph. To meet this challenge, we present a graph gradual domain adaptation (GGDA) framework, which constructs a compact domain sequence that minimizes information loss during adaptation. Our approach starts with an efficient generation of knowledge-preserving intermediate graphs over the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric. A GGDA domain sequence is then constructed upon this bridging data pool through a novel vertex-based progression, which involves selecting "close" vertices and performing adaptive domain advancement to enhance inter-domain transferability. Theoretically, our framework provides implementable upper and lower bounds for the intractable inter-domain Wasserstein distance, $W_p(\mu_t,\mu_{t+1})$, enabling its flexible adjustment for optimal domain formation. Extensive experiments across diverse transfer scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our GGDA framework.

  _Kuan Lu, Menghao Huo, Yuxiao Li, Qiang Zhu, Zhenrui Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is fundamental to enhancing the dynamic performance of modern power grids, especially under high renewable penetration. This paper presents Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), a novel deep learning model designed to provide long-term, high-fidelity forecasts of wind and solar power. Unlike conventional time-series models, CT-PatchTST captures both temporal dependencies and inter-channel correlations-features that are critical for effective energy storage planning, control, and dispatch. Reliable forecasting enables proactive deployment of energy storage systems (ESSs), helping to mitigate uncertainties in renewable output, reduce system response time, and optimize storage operation based on location-specific flow and voltage conditions. Evaluated on real-world datasets from Denmark's offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar generation, CT-PatchTST outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness. By enabling predictive, data-driven coordination of ESSs across integrated source-grid-load-storage systems, this work contributes to the design of more stable, responsive, and cost-efficient power networks.

  This article presents a generic approach to convolution that significantly differs from conventional methodologies in the current Machine Learning literature. The approach, in its mathematical aspects, proved to be clear and concise, particularly when high-order tensors are involved. In this context, a rational theory of regression in neural networks is developed, as a framework for a generic view of sparse convolutional neural networks, the primary focus of this study. As a direct outcome, the classic Backpropagation Algorithm is redefined to align with this rational tensor-based approach and presented in its simplest, most generic form.

  In many real-world settings, regulations and economic incentives permit the sharing of models but not data across institutional boundaries. In such scenarios, practitioners might hope to adapt models to new domains, without losing performance on previous domains (so-called catastrophic forgetting). While any single model may struggle to achieve this goal, learning an ensemble of domain-specific experts offers the potential to adapt more closely to each individual institution. However, a core challenge in this context is determining which expert to deploy at test time. In this paper, we propose Generate to Discriminate (G2D), a domain-incremental continual learning method that leverages synthetic data to train a domain-discriminator that routes samples at inference time to the appropriate expert. Surprisingly, we find that leveraging synthetic data in this capacity is more effective than using the samples to \textit{directly} train the downstream classifier (the more common approach to leveraging synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature). We observe that G2D outperforms competitive domain-incremental learning methods on tasks in both vision and language modalities, providing a new perspective on the use of synthetic data in the lifelong learning literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction have introduced sophisticated training techniques and model architectures. However, reliance on outdated baselines may exaggerate the benefits of these new approaches. To tackle this issue, we systematically explore Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) by applying model-agnostic tricks in recent methods and tuning hyperparameters. We find that a well-tuned GAE can match the performance of recent sophisticated models while offering superior computational efficiency on widely-used link prediction benchmarks. Our approach delivers substantial performance gains on datasets where structural information dominates and feature data is limited. Specifically, our GAE achieves a state-of-the-art Hits@100 score of 78.41\% on the ogbl-ppa dataset. Furthermore, we examine the impact of various tricks to uncover the reasons behind our success and to guide the design of future methods. Our study emphasizes the critical need to update baselines for a more accurate assessment of progress in GNNs for link prediction. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Shiqi Liu, Yihua Tan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the advancement of computer vision and natural language processing, text-to-video generation, enabled by text-to-video diffusion models, has become more prevalent. These models are trained using a large amount of data from the internet. However, the training data often contain copyrighted content, including cartoon character icons and artist styles, private portraits, and unsafe videos. Since filtering the data and retraining the model is challenging, methods for unlearning specific concepts from text-to-video diffusion models have been investigated. However, due to the high computational complexity and relative large optimization scale, there is little work on unlearning methods for text-to-video diffusion models. We propose a novel concept-unlearning method by transferring the unlearning capability of the text encoder of text-to-image diffusion models to text-to-video diffusion models. Specifically, the method optimizes the text encoder using few-shot unlearning, where several generated images are used. We then use the optimized text encoder in text-to-video diffusion models to generate videos. Our method costs low computation resources and has small optimization scale. We discuss the generated videos after unlearning a concept. The experiments demonstrates that our method can unlearn copyrighted cartoon characters, artist styles, objects and people's facial characteristics. Our method can unlearn a concept within about 100 seconds on an RTX 3070. Since there was no concept unlearning method for text-to-video diffusion models before, we make concept unlearning feasible and more accessible in the text-to-video domain.

  _Futa Waseda, Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial training often suffers from a robustness-accuracy trade-off, where achieving high robustness comes at the cost of accuracy. One approach to mitigate this trade-off is leveraging invariance regularization, which encourages model invariance under adversarial perturbations; however, it still leads to accuracy loss. In this work, we closely analyze the challenges of using invariance regularization in adversarial training and understand how to address them. Our analysis identifies two key issues: (1) a ``gradient conflict" between invariance and classification objectives, leading to suboptimal convergence, and (2) the mixture distribution problem arising from diverged distributions between clean and adversarial inputs. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric Representation-regularized Adversarial Training (ARAT), which incorporates asymmetric invariance loss with stop-gradient operation and a predictor to avoid gradient conflict, and a split-BatchNorm (BN) structure to resolve the mixture distribution problem. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that each component effectively addresses the identified issues, offering novel insights into adversarial defense. ARAT shows superiority over existing methods across various settings. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings to knowledge distillation-based defenses, providing a new perspective on their relative successes.

  _Marco Saponara, Elias Fernandez Domingos, Jorge M. Pacheco, Tom Lenaerts_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Empirical evidence shows that human behaviour often deviates from game-theoretical rationality. For instance, humans may hold unrealistic expectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases remain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive biases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a population deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies to anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the Incremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a systematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while negatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that selection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational behaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as the reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly, positively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing to a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased reasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning strategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful thinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that certain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute an adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas.

  _Xinxing Ren, Caelum Forder, Qianbo Zang, Ahsen Tahir, Roman J. Georgio, Suman Deb, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in generalist multi-agent systems (MAS) have largely followed a context-engineering plus centralized paradigm, where a planner agent coordinates multiple worker agents through unidirectional prompt passing. While effective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical limitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to degraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited inter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt concatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information loss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS built on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol. Unlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent collaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results, identify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm reduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and minimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and cost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved 52.73% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the strongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63%) by +9.09% under identical LLM settings. Our implementation is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-Agent Path Finding in Continuous Time (\mapfr) extends the classical MAPF problem by allowing agents to operate in continuous time. Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CCBS) is a foundational algorithm for solving \mapfr optimally. In this paper, we revisit the theoretical claims of CCBS and show the algorithm is incomplete, due to an uncountably infinite state space created by continuous wait durations. Through theoretical analysis and counter-examples, we examine the inherent challenges of extending existing MAPF solvers to address \mapfr while preserving optimality guarantees. By restricting waiting duration to fixed amounts, we identify a related sub-problem on graphs, \mapfrdt which we show is optimally solvable, including by CCBS. It remains an open question whether similar models exist for \mapfrct, a generalised version of \mapfrdt that allows arbitrary wait times, and \mapfrcs, which further allows arbitrary movements in continuous space.

  _Jiahe Pan, Jiaxu Xing, Rudolf Reiter, Yifan Zhai, Elie Aljalbout, Davide Scaramuzza_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However, transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

Given the user design requirements, Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products, bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from imaginative ideas.

  Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic, probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online, without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory system.

  Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac, an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities. Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$), material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise robotic manipulation.

  Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction, and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary 3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints. ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

  As space exploration advances, underground environments are becoming increasingly attractive due to their potential to provide shelter, easier access to resources, and enhanced scientific opportunities. Although such environments exist on Earth, they are often not easily accessible and do not accurately represent the diversity of underground environments found throughout the solar system.

Its flexible structure allows for the continuous enhancement of various underground features, aligning with our expanding understanding of the solar system. The environments generated using PLUME can be used for AI training, evaluating robotics algorithms, 3D rendering, and facilitating rapid iteration on developed exploration algorithms.

  Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex, unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths. Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies.

  Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore, the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming data, and time-varying network topologies.

  Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process. However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a dual-arm robot manipulation task.

  Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP), which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task.

  This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual reality and teleoperation. It integrates pneumatic actuation and conductive fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers, the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads through a fully soft, wearable interface.Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks. Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced human-machine interaction applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion: when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms, limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation, UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence). Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the state-of-the-art.

  Enabling multiple autonomous machines to perform reliably requires the development of efficient cooperative control algorithms. This paper presents a survey of algorithms that have been developed for controlling and coordinating autonomous machines in complex environments. We especially focus on task allocation methods using computational intelligence (CI) and deep reinforcement learning (RL). The advantages and disadvantages of the surveyed methods are analysed thoroughly. We also propose and discuss in detail various future research directions that shed light on how to improve existing algorithms or create new methods to enhance the employability and performance of autonomous machines in real-world applications. The findings indicate that CI and deep RL methods provide viable approaches to addressing complex task allocation problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The recent development of deep RL has greatly contributed to the literature on controlling and coordinating autonomous machines, and it has become a growing trend in this area. It is envisaged that this paper will provide researchers and engineers with a comprehensive overview of progress in machine learning research related to autonomous machines. It also highlights underexplored areas, identifies emerging methodologies, and suggests new avenues for exploration in future research within this domain.

  _TianChen Huang, Wei Gao, Runchen Xu, Shiwu Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse, safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual (Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact, forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence, and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

  We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1 to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

  Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation. Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors. Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies. In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In post-disaster scenarios, rapid and efficient delivery of medical resources is critical and challenging due to severe damage to infrastructure. To provide an optimized solution, we propose a cooperative trajectory optimization and task allocation framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This study integrates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for efficient task allocation among multiple UAVs and UGVs, and employs an informed-RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm for collision-free trajectory generation. Further optimization of task sequencing and path efficiency is conducted using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Simulation experiments conducted in a realistic post-disaster environment demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the overall efficiency of medical rescue operations compared to traditional strategies. Specifically, our method reduces the total mission completion time to 26.7 minutes for a 15-task scenario, outperforming K-Means clustering and random allocation by over 73%. Furthermore, the framework achieves a substantial 15.1% reduction in total traveled distance after CMA-ES optimization. The cooperative utilization of UAVs and UGVs effectively balances their complementary advantages, highlighting the system's scalability and practicality for real-world deployment.

  _Zifan Wang, Teli Ma, Yufei Jia, Xun Yang, Jiaming Zhou, Wenlong Ouyang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agile locomotion in complex 3D environments requires robust spatial awareness to safely avoid diverse obstacles such as aerial clutter, uneven terrain, and dynamic agents. Depth-based perception approaches often struggle with sensor noise, lighting variability, computational overhead from intermediate representations (e.g., elevation maps), and difficulties with non-planar obstacles, limiting performance in unstructured environments. In contrast, direct integration of LiDAR sensing into end-to-end learning for legged locomotion remains underexplored. We propose Omni-Perception, an end-to-end locomotion policy that achieves 3D spatial awareness and omnidirectional collision avoidance by directly processing raw LiDAR point clouds. At its core is PD-RiskNet (Proximal-Distal Risk-Aware Hierarchical Network), a novel perception module that interprets spatio-temporal LiDAR data for environmental risk assessment. To facilitate efficient policy learning, we develop a high-fidelity LiDAR simulation toolkit with realistic noise modeling and fast raycasting, compatible with platforms such as Isaac Gym, Genesis, and MuJoCo, enabling scalable training and effective sim-to-real transfer. Learning reactive control policies directly from raw LiDAR data enables the robot to navigate complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles more robustly than approaches relying on intermediate maps or limited sensing. We validate Omni-Perception through real-world experiments and extensive simulation, demonstrating strong omnidirectional avoidance capabilities and superior locomotion performance in highly dynamic environments.

- **[Staircase Recognition and Location Based on Polarization Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19026)**  `arXiv:2505.19026`

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Staircase is one of the most common structures in artificial scenes. However, it is difficult for humanoid robots and people with lower limb disabilities or visual impairment to cross the scene without the help of sensors and intelligent algorithms. Staircase scene perception technology is a prerequisite for recognition and localization. This technology is of great significance for the mode switching of the robot and the calculation of the footprint position to adapt to the discontinuous terrain. However, there are still many problems that constrain the application of this technology, such as low recognition accuracy, high initial noise from sensors, unstable output signals and high computational requirements. In terms of scene reconstruction, the binocular and time of flight (TOF) reconstruction of the scene can be easily affected by environmental light and the surface material of the target object. In contrast, due to the special structure of the polarizer, the polarization can selectively transmit polarized light in a specific direction and this reconstruction method relies on the polarization information of the object surface. So the advantages of polarization reconstruction are reflected, which are less affected by environmental light and not dependent on the texture information of the object surface. In this paper, in order to achieve the detection of staircase, this paper proposes a contrast enhancement algorithm that integrates polarization and light intensity information, and integrates point cloud segmentation based on YOLOv11. To realize the high-quality reconstruction, we proposed a method of fusing polarized binocular and TOF depth information to realize the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the staircase. Besides, it also proposes a joint calibration algorithm of monocular camera and TOF camera based on ICP registration and improved gray wolf optimization algorithm.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though robotic dexterous manipulation has progressed substantially recently, challenges like in-hand occlusion still necessitate fine-grained tactile perception, leading to the integration of more tactile sensors into robotic hands. Consequently, the increased data volume imposes substantial bandwidth pressure on signal transmission from the hand's controller. However, the acquisition and compression of multi-point tactile signals based on the dexterous hands' physical structures have not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a Multi-Point Tactile Dataset for Dexterous Hand Grasping (Dex-MPTD). This dataset captures tactile signals from multiple contact sensors across various objects and grasping poses, offering a comprehensive benchmark for advancing dexterous robotic manipulation research. Second, we investigate both lossless and lossy compression on Dex-MPTD by converting tactile data into images and applying six lossless and five lossy image codecs for efficient compression. Experimental results demonstrate that tactile data can be losslessly compressed to as low as 0.0364 bits per sub-sample (bpss), achieving approximately 200$\times$ compression ratio compared to the raw tactile data. Efficient lossy compressors like HM and VTM can achieve about 1000$\times$ data reductions while preserving acceptable data fidelity. The exploration of lossy compression also reveals that screen-content-targeted coding tools outperform general-purpose codecs in compressing tactile data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a weakly-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on any video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

  _Qian Feng, Jianxiang Feng, Zhaopeng Chen, Rudolph Triebel, Alois Knoll_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page:this https URL).
