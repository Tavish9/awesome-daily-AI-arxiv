- **[Refining Gelfond Rationality Principle Towards More Comprehensive Foundational Principles for Answer Set Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01833)**  `arXiv:2507.01833`  
  _Yi-Dong Shen, Thomas Eiter_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property, constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively. Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity.

- **[Joint Matching and Pricing for Crowd-shipping with In-store Customers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01749)**  `arXiv:2507.01749`  
  _Arash Dehghan, Mucahit Cevik, Merve Bodur, Bissan Ghaddar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming (NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network (DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

- **[T3DM: Test-Time Training-Guided Distribution Shift Modelling for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01597)**  `arXiv:2507.01597`  
  _Yuehang Si, Zefan Zeng, Jincai Huang, Qing Cheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning (TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling (T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

- **[Agent-as-Tool: A Study on the Hierarchical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01489)**  `arXiv:2507.01489`  
  _Yanfei Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus. However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent. Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Improving customer service quality and response time are critical factors for maintaining customer loyalty and increasing a company's market share. While adopting emerging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming a necessity to achieve these goals, the risk of hallucination remains a major challenge. In this paper, we present a multi-agent system to handle customer requests sent via SMS. This system integrates LLM based agents with fuzzy logic to mitigate hallucination risks.

- **[A Fuzzy Approach to the Specification, Verification and Validation of Risk-Based Ethical Decision Making Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01410)**  `arXiv:2507.01410`  
  _Abeer Dyoub, Francesca A. Lisi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ontological and epistemic complexities inherent in the moral domain make it challenging to establish clear standards for evaluating the performance of a moral machine. In this paper, we present a formal method to describe Ethical Decision Making models based on ethical risk assessment. Then, we show how these models that are specified as fuzzy rules can be verified and validated using fuzzy Petri nets. A case study from the medical field is considered to illustrate the proposed approach.

- **[AI Agents and Agentic AI-Navigating a Plethora of Concepts for Future Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01376)**  `arXiv:2507.01376`  
  _Yinwang Ren, Yangyang Liu, Tang Ji, Xun Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive, reason, and act within dynamic environments. With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension, complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents (MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential challenges they may face.

- **[Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01231)**  `arXiv:2507.01231`  
  _I√±aki Dellibarda Varela, Pablo Romero-Sorozabal, Eduardo Rocon, Manuel Cebrian_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots. Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100 agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

- **[Can Large Language Models Develop Strategic Reasoning? Post-training Insights from Learning Chess](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00726)**  `arXiv:2507.00726`  
  _Dongyoon Hwang, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo, Dongmin Park, Jongho Park_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome.

- **[World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)**  `arXiv:2506.21230`  
  _Junhao Shi, Zhaoye Fei, Siyin Wang, Qipeng Guo, Jingjing Gong, Xipeng Qiu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a 60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

- **[MMLU-Reason: Benchmarking Multi-Task Multi-modal Language Understanding and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16459)**  `arXiv:2505.16459`  
  _Guiyao Tie, Xueyang Zhou, Tianhe Gu, Ruihang Zhang, Chaoran Hu, Sizhe Zhang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMLU-Reason, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMLU-Reason comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMLU-Reason offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

- **[Beating Transformers using Synthetic Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07619)**  `arXiv:2504.07619`  
  _Alfredo Ibias, Miguel Rodriguez-Galindo, Hector Antona, Guillem Ramirez-Miranda, Enric Guinovart_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of context-aware reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop context-aware reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.

- **[MedAgent-Pro: Towards Evidence-based Multi-modal Medical Diagnosis via Reasoning Agentic Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18968)**  `arXiv:2503.18968`  
  _Ziyue Wang, Junde Wu, Linghan Cai, Chang Han Low, Xihong Yang, Qiaxuan Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In modern medicine, clinical diagnosis relies on the comprehensive analysis of primarily textual and visual data, drawing on medical expertise to ensure systematic and rigorous reasoning. Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and agent-based methods hold great potential for medical diagnosis, thanks to the ability to effectively integrate multi-modal patient data. However, they often provide direct answers and draw empirical-driven conclusions without quantitative analysis, which reduces their reliability and clinical usability. We propose MedAgent-Pro, a new agentic reasoning paradigm that follows the diagnosis principle in modern medicine, to decouple the process into sequential components for step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning. Our MedAgent-Pro workflow presents a hierarchical diagnostic structure to mirror this principle, consisting of disease-level standardized plan generation and patient-level personalized step-by-step reasoning. To support disease-level planning, an RAG-based agent is designed to retrieve medical guidelines to ensure alignment with clinical standards. For patient-level reasoning, we propose to integrate professional tools such as visual models to enable quantitative assessments. Meanwhile, we propose to verify the reliability of each step to achieve evidence-based diagnosis, enforcing rigorous logical reasoning and a well-founded conclusion. Extensive experiments across a wide range of anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and diseases demonstrate the superiority of MedAgent-Pro to mainstream VLMs, agentic systems and state-of-the-art expert models. Ablation studies and human evaluation by clinical experts further validate its robustness and clinical relevance. Code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Using Large Language Models to Categorize Strategic Situations and Decipher Motivations Behind Human Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15752)**  `arXiv:2503.15752`  
  _Yutong Xie, Qiaozhu Mei, Walter Yuan, Matthew O. Jackson_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  By varying prompts to a large language model, we can elicit the full range of human behaviors in a variety of different scenarios in classic economic games. By analyzing which prompts elicit which behaviors, we can categorize and compare different strategic situations, which can also help provide insight into what different economic scenarios induce people to think about. We discuss how this provides a first step towards a non-standard method of inferring (deciphering) the motivations behind the human behaviors. We also show how this deciphering process can be used to categorize differences in the behavioral tendencies of different populations.

  _Xuanle Zhao, Xianzhen Luo, Qi Shi, Chi Chen, Shuo Wang, Zhiyuan Liu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding tasks. However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[MCCoder: Streamlining Motion Control with LLM-Assisted Code Generation and Rigorous Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15154)**  `arXiv:2410.15154`  
  _Yin Li, Liangwei Wang, Shiyuan Piao, Boo-Ho Yang, Ziyue Li, Wei Zeng, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation. However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.

  _Rabindra Khadka, Pedro G Lind, Anis Yazidi, Asma Belhadi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive way to observe brain activity in real time. Deep learning has enhanced EEG analysis, enabling meaningful pattern detection for clinical and research purposes. However, most existing frameworks for EEG data analysis are either focused on preprocessing techniques or deep learning model development, often overlooking the crucial need for structured documentation and model interpretability. In this paper, we introduce DREAMS (Deep REport for AI ModelS), a Python-based framework designed to generate automated model cards for deep learning models applied to EEG data. Unlike generic model reporting tools, DREAMS is specifically tailored for EEG-based deep learning applications, incorporating domain-specific metadata, preprocessing details, performance metrics, and uncertainty quantification. The framework seamlessly integrates with deep learning pipelines, providing structured YAML-based documentation. We evaluate DREAMS through two case studies: an EEG emotion classification task using the FACED dataset and a abnormal EEG classification task using the Temple Univeristy Hospital (TUH) Abnormal dataset. These evaluations demonstrate how the generated model card enhances transparency by documenting model performance, dataset biases, and interpretability limitations. Unlike existing model documentation approaches, DREAMS provides visualized performance metrics, dataset alignment details, and model uncertainty estimations, making it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians working with EEG-based AI. The source code for DREAMS is open-source, facilitating broad adoption in healthcare AI, research, and ethical AI development.

- **[Combating Confirmation Bias: A Unified Pseudo-Labeling Framework for Entity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02075)**  `arXiv:2307.02075`  
  _Qijie Ding, Jie Yin, Daokun Zhang, Junbin Gao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Entity alignment (EA) aims at identifying equivalent entity pairs across different knowledge graphs (KGs) that refer to the same real-world identity. To circumvent the shortage of seed alignments provided for training, recent EA models utilize pseudo-labeling strategies to iteratively add unaligned entity pairs predicted with high confidence to the seed alignments for model training. However, the adverse impact of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling has been largely overlooked, thus hindering entity alignment performance. To systematically combat confirmation bias for pseudo-labeling-based entity alignment, we propose a Unified Pseudo-Labeling framework for Entity Alignment (UPL-EA) that explicitly eliminates pseudo-labeling errors to boost the accuracy of entity alignment. UPL-EA consists of two complementary components: (1) Optimal Transport (OT)-based pseudo-labeling uses discrete OT modeling as an effective means to determine entity correspondences and reduce erroneous matches across two KGs. An effective criterion is derived to infer pseudo-labeled alignments that satisfy one-to-one correspondences; (2) Parallel pseudo-label ensembling refines pseudo-labeled alignments by combining predictions over multiple models independently trained in parallel. The ensembled pseudo-labeled alignments are thereafter used to augment seed alignments to reinforce subsequent model training for alignment inference. The effectiveness of UPL-EA in eliminating pseudo-labeling errors is both theoretically supported and experimentally validated. Our extensive results and in-depth analyses demonstrate the superiority of UPL-EA over 15 competitive baselines and its utility as a general pseudo-labeling framework for entity alignment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy. We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM) decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of traditional intrinsic metrics.

- **[NaturalThoughts: Selecting and Distilling Reasoning Traces for General Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01921)**  `arXiv:2507.01921`  
  _Yang Li, Youssef Emad, Karthik Padthe, Jack Lanchantin, Weizhe Yuan, Thao Nguyen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer the teacher model's reasoning skills.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both helpfulness and harmlessness.

  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3) Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources, including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

  _Songtao Liu, Peng Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers, without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27 datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the "SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce \textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation (MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and 3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition, DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement. Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond English centric benchmarks and address the requirements of linguistically diverse regions such as India. We present EKA-EVAL, a unified and production-ready evaluation framework that integrates over 35 benchmarks, including 10 Indic-specific datasets, spanning categories like reasoning, mathematics, tool use, long-context understanding, and reading comprehension. Compared to existing Indian language evaluation tools, EKA-EVAL offers broader benchmark coverage, with built-in support for distributed inference, quantization, and multi-GPU usage. Our systematic comparison positions EKA-EVAL as the first end-to-end, extensible evaluation suite tailored for both global and Indic LLMs, significantly lowering the barrier to multilingual benchmarking. The framework is open-source and publicly available atthis https URLeka-eval and a part of ongoing EKA initiative (this https URL), which aims to scale up to over 100 benchmarks and establish a robust, multilingual evaluation ecosystem for LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency, accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match, we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents, highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

  Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

  _Tianze Hua, Tian Yun, Ellie Pavlick_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g., an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g., "What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within complex multimodal environments.

  Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent at evaluation awareness and deception.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

  Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina & Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis, and have significant implications for both quantitative and qualitative approaches in corpus-based research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature, presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments. To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching 80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources, and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion, gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective AI systems.

  The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this, we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples, thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness. Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained analyses of model-specific weaknesses.

  _Rifki Afina Putri_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen (absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or through a related language.

  Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural, representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end \textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for next-generation conversational agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable, opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets. Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases, with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based systems which suggests that external information enhances performance, highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-scope (OOS) intent detection is a critical challenge in task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS), as it ensures robustness to unseen and ambiguous queries. In this work, we propose a novel but simple modular framework that combines uncertainty modeling with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) for efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a deployed TODS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities. Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group. However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

  _Tianyu Liu, Qitan Lv, Hao Li, Xing Gao, Xiao Sun_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel, has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens per decoding step.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation. The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher data quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce LEDOM, the first purely reverse language model, trained autoregressively on 435B tokens with 2B and 7B parameter variants, which processes sequences in reverse temporal order through previous token prediction. For the first time, we present the reverse language model as a potential foundational model across general tasks, accompanied by a set of intriguing examples and insights. Based on LEDOM, we further introduce a novel application: Reverse Reward, where LEDOM-guided reranking of forward language model outputs leads to substantial performance improvements on mathematical reasoning tasks. This approach leverages LEDOM's unique backward reasoning capability to refine generation quality through posterior evaluation. Our findings suggest that LEDOM exhibits unique characteristics with broad application potential. We will release all models, training code, and pre-training data to facilitate future research.

  Navigating the complexities of physics reasoning has long been a difficult task for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring a synthesis of profound conceptual understanding and adept problem-solving techniques. In this study, we investigate the application of advanced instruction-tuned reasoning models, such as Deepseek-R1, to address a diverse spectrum of physics problems curated from the challenging SciBench benchmark. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation reveals the remarkable capabilities of reasoning models. Not only do they achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in answering intricate physics questions, but they also generate distinctive reasoning patterns that emphasize on symbolic derivation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even for these highly sophisticated reasoning models, the strategic incorporation of few-shot prompting can still yield measurable improvements in overall accuracy, highlighting the potential for continued performance gains.

  Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored. This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25), driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1 <0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes (McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions. GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in ophthalmology.

  In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by 419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%. At the end of our paper we show the possible future path of research and potential applications of our findings.

  Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions. Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

  The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and 20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting intellectual changes in Sweden.In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition, confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers.

  An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event information contained in the summaries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training, it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and multilingual processing tasks.

  Existing function-calling benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions. However, they overlook the complexity of real-world scenarios. To quantify how existing benchmarks address practical applications, we introduce DICE-SCORE, a metric that evaluates the dispersion of tool-related information such as function name and parameter values throughout the dialogue. Analyzing existing benchmarks through DICE-SCORE reveals notably low scores, highlighting the need for more realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we present DICE-BENCH, a framework that constructs practical function-calling datasets by synthesizing conversations through a tool graph that maintains dependencies across rounds and a multi-agent system with distinct personas to enhance dialogue naturalness. The final dataset comprises 1,607 high-DICE-SCORE instances. Our experiments on 19 LLMs with DICE-BENCH show that significant advances are still required before such models can be deployed effectively in real-world settings.

  Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians, proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value, cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80% diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89 percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by 3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for high-performing text classification.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites. BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of 5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama, and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level, real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition, the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78. BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will be made available via the following GitHub repository:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident. Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior. To evaluate the potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind, and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

  We present BIS Reasoning 1.0, the first large-scale Japanese dataset of syllogistic reasoning problems explicitly designed to evaluate belief-inconsistent reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets such as NeuBAROCO and JFLD, which focus on general or belief-aligned reasoning, BIS Reasoning 1.0 introduces logically valid yet belief-inconsistent syllogisms to uncover reasoning biases in LLMs trained on human-aligned corpora. We benchmark state-of-the-art models - including GPT models, Claude models, and leading Japanese LLMs - revealing significant variance in performance, with GPT-4o achieving 79.54% accuracy. Our analysis identifies critical weaknesses in current LLMs when handling logically valid but belief-conflicting inputs. These findings have important implications for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains such as law, healthcare, and scientific literature, where truth must override intuitive belief to ensure integrity and safety.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for non-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities. However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \textbf{27.6$\times$ throughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the recent strides in large language models, studies have underscored the existence of social biases within these systems. In this paper, we delve into the validation and comparison of the ethical biases of LLMs concerning globally discussed and potentially sensitive topics, hypothesizing that these biases may arise from language-specific distinctions. Introducing the Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (MSQAD), we collected news articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages. We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics, employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

  The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation, and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method. Our code and data are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  PDF documents have the potential to provide trillions of novel, high-quality tokens for training language models. However, these documents come in a diversity of types with differing formats and visual layouts that pose a challenge when attempting to extract and faithfully represent the underlying content for language model use. Traditional open source tools often produce lower quality extractions compared to vision language models (VLMs), but reliance on the best VLMs can be prohibitively costly (e.g., over 6,240 USD per million PDF pages for GPT-4o) or infeasible if the PDFs cannot be sent to proprietary APIs. We present olmOCR, an open-source toolkit for processing PDFs into clean, linearized plain text in natural reading order while preserving structured content like sections, tables, lists, equations, and more. Our toolkit runs a fine-tuned 7B vision language model (VLM) trained on olmOCR-mix-0225, a sample of 260,000 pages from over 100,000 crawled PDFs with diverse properties, including graphics, handwritten text and poor quality scans. olmOCR is optimized for large-scale batch processing, able to scale flexibly to different hardware setups and can convert a million PDF pages for only 176 USD. To aid comparison with existing systems, we also introduce olmOCR-Bench, a curated set of 1,400 PDFs capturing many content types that remain challenging even for the best tools and VLMs, including formulas, tables, tiny fonts, old scans, and more. We find olmOCR outperforms even top VLMs including GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2 and Qwen-2.5-VL. We openly release all components of olmOCR: our fine-tuned VLM model, training code and data, an efficient inference pipeline that supports vLLM and SGLang backends, and benchmark olmOCR-Bench.

  Visually linking matching cues is a crucial ability in daily life, such as identifying the same person in multiple photos based on their cues, even without knowing who they are. Despite the extensive knowledge that vision-language models (VLMs) possess, it remains largely unexplored whether they are capable of performing this fundamental task. To address this, we introduce \textbf{VLM2-Bench}, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across twelve VLMs, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues.

  The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in content generation, coding, and common-sense reasoning has spurred widespread integration into many facets of society. However, integration of LLMs raises valid questions on their reliability and trustworthiness, given their propensity to generate hallucinations: plausible, factually-incorrect responses, which are expressed with striking confidence. Previous work has shown that hallucinations and other non-factual responses generated by LLMs can be detected by examining the uncertainty of the LLM in its response to the pertinent prompt, driving significant research efforts devoted to quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs. This survey seeks to provide an extensive review of existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, identifying their salient features, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art. Furthermore, we highlight applications of uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, spanning chatbot and textual applications to embodied artificial intelligence applications in robotics. We conclude with open research challenges in uncertainty quantification of LLMs, seeking to motivate future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across various applications, there is a growing need to control text generation to satisfy specific constraints or requirements. This raises a crucial question: Is it possible to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction in generated outputs while preserving the distribution of the original model as much as possible? We first define the ideal distribution - the one closest to the original model, which also always satisfies the expressed constraint - as the ultimate goal of guaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it is impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This motivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods to enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple yet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution with rejection sampling. Through GUARD's theoretical properties, we show how controlling the KL divergence between a specific proposal and the target ideal distribution simultaneously optimizes inference speed and distributional closeness. To validate these theoretical concepts, we conduct extensive experiments on two text generation settings with hard-to-satisfy constraints: a lexical constraint scenario and a sentiment reversal scenario. These experiments show that GUARD achieves perfect constraint satisfaction while almost preserving the ideal distribution with highly improved inference efficiency. GUARD provides a principled approach to enforcing strict guarantees for LLMs without compromising their generative capabilities.

  Modern QA systems entail retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate and trustworthy responses. However, the inherent gap between user queries and relevant documents hinders precise matching. We introduce QAEncoder, a training-free approach to bridge this gap. Specifically, QAEncoder estimates the expectation of potential queries in the embedding space as a robust surrogate for the document embedding, and attaches document fingerprints to effectively distinguish these embeddings. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, languages, and embedding models confirmed QAEncoder's alignment capability, which offers a simple-yet-effective solution with zero additional index storage, retrieval latency, training costs, or catastrophic forgetting and hallucination issues.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper investigates the faithfulness of multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents in a graphical user interface (GUI) environment, aiming to address the research question of whether multimodal GUI agents can be distracted by environmental context. A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent surge of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to claims that they are approaching a level of creativity akin to human capabilities. This idea has sparked a blend of excitement and apprehension. However, a critical piece that has been missing in this discourse is a systematic evaluation of LLMs' semantic diversity, particularly in comparison to human divergent thinking. To bridge this gap, we leverage recent advances in computational creativity to analyze semantic divergence in both state-of-the-art LLMs and a substantial dataset of 100,000 humans. We found evidence that LLMs can surpass average human performance on the Divergent Association Task, and approach human creative writing abilities, though they fall short of the typical performance of highly creative humans. Notably, even the top performing LLMs are still largely surpassed by highly creative individuals, underscoring a ceiling that current LLMs still fail to surpass. Our human-machine benchmarking framework addresses the polemic surrounding the imminent replacement of human creative labour by AI, disentangling the quality of the respective creative linguistic outputs using established objective measures. While prompting deeper exploration of the distinctive elements of human inventive thought compared to those of AI systems, we lay out a series of techniques to improve their outputs with respect to semantic diversity, such as prompt design and hyper-parameter tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for generating responses consistent with human values. However, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts manipulate them into producing toxic content. One category of such attacks reformulates the task as an optimization problem, aiming to elicit affirmative responses from the LLM. However, these methods heavily rely on predefined objectionable behaviors, limiting their effectiveness and adaptability to diverse harmful queries. In this study, we first identify why the vanilla target loss is suboptimal and then propose enhancements to the loss objective. We introduce DSN (Don't Say No) attack, which combines a cosine decay schedule method with refusal suppression to achieve higher success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSN outperforms baseline attacks and achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates (ASR). DSN also shows strong universality and transferability to unseen datasets and black-box models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2) Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256 to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized autoregressive models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and its variants, etc).The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or 3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized benchmarking framework.We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists; this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4) While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6) reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial misalignments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

  While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic, information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

  Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

  Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention, resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V) generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences. CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation, VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code for data construction and evaluation at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism, evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models. More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven baseline. The code and trained models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production, aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However, current approaches conventionally separate image customization into position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters.

  _Ranjan Sapkota, Zhichao Meng, Martin Churuvija, Xiaoqiang Du, Zenghong Ma, Manoj Karkee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system. However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and 13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated, comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR) requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins (DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets, including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars, and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and dosimetric accuracies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID) problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically, learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots). This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications, such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal in healthcare applications.

  Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress in image enhancement (IE). However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices, remains challenging due to high computation and memory demands. To address these challenges and facilitate real-time IE on mobile, we introduce an extremely lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with around 4K parameters. Our approach integrates reparameterization with an Incremental Weight Optimization strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism, optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework, we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per second (FPS) while delivering competitive image quality, achieving the best trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will be available atthis https URL.

  Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR) framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration, grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark. In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

  Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization, as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject fidelity and prompt consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid (SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR) frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However, they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14 Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe) benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal changes in glacier calving fronts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and 3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its general applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery, and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

  _Zhongwen Zhang, Yuri Boykov_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised problems/systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery in unlabeled image datasets.

  Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion, Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions, and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks, including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset, demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework. Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image. Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

  Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning, drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage rather than an imposed limitation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images, significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions. The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations, effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

  Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

  We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships, resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details. Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks, synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.Project Page:this https URLCode:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless, current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text. Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss (RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets. Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$, \textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases. Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel, training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically, steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long videos.

  The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset, SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently, segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning, which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement (IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results from diverse discriminative architectures.

  The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\% of noise while preserving the majority of the valid signal. We have proposed four algorithms based on the matrix of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters method. We compared them on several event datasets that were further modified by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in embedded devices.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer, reconstruction technique or dose. AI harmonization techniques can address this problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings. This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization strategies.

  The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV tracking.

  Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5 encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities. Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub repository, including the preprocessed YouTubeASL data.

  Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations, a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

  The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However, these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians, due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's practical utility.

  Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained outcomes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

  Although video multimodal large language models (video MLLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video captioning tasks, it remains challenging to adjust the focal emphasis of video captions according to human preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Aligned Video Captioning via Direct Preference Optimization (AVC-DPO), a post-training framework designed to enhance captioning capabilities in video MLLMs through preference alignment. Our approach designs enhanced prompts that specifically target temporal dynamics and spatial information-two key factors that humans care about when watching a video-thereby incorporating human-centric preferences. AVC-DPO leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied prompt conditions to conduct preference-aware training and caption alignment. Using this framework, we have achieved exceptional performance in the LOVE@CVPR'25 Workshop Track 1A: Video Detailed Captioning Challenge, achieving first place on the Video Detailed Captioning (VDC) benchmark according to the VDCSCORE evaluation metric.

  High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

  Visual pose tracking is playing an increasingly vital role in industrial contexts in recent years. However, the pose tracking for industrial metal objects remains a challenging task especially in the real world-environments, due to the reflection characteristic of metal objects. To address this issue, we propose a novel 6DoF pose tracking method based on active control points. The method uses image control points to generate edge feature for optimization actively instead of 6DoF pose-based rendering, and serve them as optimization variables. We also introduce an optimal control point regression method to improve robustness. The proposed tracking method performs effectively in both dataset evaluation and real world tasks, providing a viable solution for real-time tracking of industrial metal objects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models, through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\% increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively, SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D, calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2) variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

  Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space, enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM). It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models. Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

  An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g., descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation. Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance, CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite better lexical alignment. Code will be available onthis https URL.

  Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly, we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748 images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

  Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps. Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly available standard-definition (SD) maps. We propose a network architecture, which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and denoising techniques to enhance training stability and performance. Furthermore, we facilitate past frames for temporal consistency. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of our modeling scheme.

  _Shuai Tan, Bill Gong, Bin Ji, Ye Pan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA), particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads. To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically, we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data, which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units, which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators, weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning. Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format. Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  _Chaoxiang Cai, Longrong Yang, Kaibing Chen, Fan Yang, Xi Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER, tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

  _Andrei Jelea, Ahmed Nabil Belbachir, Marius Leordeanu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500 parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal computational and memory overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics, external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our simulated root trajectory precision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level. Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the feature representations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours, for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models (DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos. Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5% quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive, human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2 and AIGVE-MACS atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this, we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection (SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs. Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently, PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference. Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior accuracy.

  Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs, semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks -- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark, significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks: GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong generalization and deployment readiness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex, compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights challenges that need to be addressed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts. However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address this limitation, we propose ExPaMoE, a novel framework based on an Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts architecture. ExPaMoE decouples domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool based on a Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator (SODD) that detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce ImageNet++, a large-scale and realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability, and resistance to forgetting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

  In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop production is identifying individual plant components. There are several attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established, thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

  The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage, spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop. In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple, ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

  Illumination and texture editing are critical dimensions for world-to-world transfer, which is valuable for applications including sim2real and real2real visual data scaling up for embodied AI. Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

  Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.

  Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available atthis https URLand our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Ke Song, Yunhe Wu, Chunchit Siu, Huiyuan Xiong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization and (3) biased issues in dynamic-static object coupling optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.

  This work addresses mechanical defocus in Earth observation images from the IMAGIN-e mission aboard the ISS, proposing a blind deblurring approach adapted to space-based edge computing constraints. Leveraging Sentinel-2 data, our method estimates the defocus kernel and trains a restoration model within a GAN framework, effectively operating without reference images.On Sentinel-2 images with synthetic degradation, SSIM improved by 72.47% and PSNR by 25.00%, confirming the model's ability to recover lost details when the original clean image is known. On IMAGIN-e, where no reference images exist, perceptual quality metrics indicate a substantial enhancement, with NIQE improving by 60.66% and BRISQUE by 48.38%, validating real-world onboard restoration. The approach is currently deployed aboard the IMAGIN-e mission, demonstrating its practical application in an operational space environment.By efficiently handling high-resolution images under edge computing constraints, the method enables applications such as water body segmentation and contour detection while maintaining processing viability despite resource limitations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize images of user-provided concepts in diverse contexts. Despite recent progress in multi-concept personalization, most are limited to object concepts and struggle to customize abstract concepts (e.g., pose, lighting). Some methods have begun exploring multi-concept personalization supporting abstract concepts, but they require test-time fine-tuning for each new concept, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting on limited training images. In this work, we propose a novel tuning-free method for multi-concept personalization that can effectively customize both object and abstract concepts without test-time fine-tuning. Our method builds upon the modulation mechanism in pretrained Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, leveraging the localized and semantically meaningful properties of the modulation space. Specifically, we propose a novel module, Mod-Adapter, to predict concept-specific modulation direction for the modulation process of concept-related text tokens. It incorporates vision-language cross-attention for extracting concept visual features, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers that adaptively map the concept features into the modulation space. Furthermore, to mitigate the training difficulty caused by the large gap between the concept image space and the modulation space, we introduce a VLM-guided pretraining strategy that leverages the strong image understanding capabilities of vision-language models to provide semantic supervision signals. For a comprehensive comparison, we extend a standard benchmark by incorporating abstract concepts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-concept personalization, supported by quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations.

  Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis, amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}} large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it \textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

  Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

  We propose a novel framework for accurate 3D human pose estimation in combat sports using sparse multi-camera setups. Our method integrates robust multi-view 2D pose tracking via a transformer-based top-down approach, employing epipolar geometry constraints and long-term video object segmentation for consistent identity tracking across views. Initial 3D poses are obtained through weighted triangulation and spline smoothing, followed by kinematic optimization to refine pose accuracy. We further enhance pose realism and robustness by introducing a multi-person physics-based trajectory optimization step, effectively addressing challenges such as rapid motions, occlusions, and close interactions. Experimental results on diverse datasets, including a new benchmark of elite boxing footage, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we release comprehensive annotated video datasets to advance future research in multi-person pose estimation for combat sports.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we focus on scaling open-vocabulary action detection. Existing approaches for action detection are predominantly limited to closed-set scenarios and rely on complex, parameter-heavy architectures. Extending these models to the open-vocabulary setting poses two key challenges: (1) the lack of large-scale datasets with many action classes for robust training, and (2) parameter-heavy adaptations to a pretrained vision-language contrastive model to convert it for detection, risking overfitting the additional non-pretrained parameters to base action classes. Firstly, we introduce an encoder-only multimodal model for video action detection, reducing the reliance on parameter-heavy additions for video action detection. Secondly, we introduce a simple weakly supervised training strategy to exploit an existing closed-set action detection dataset for pretraining. Finally, we depart from the ill-posed base-to-novel benchmark used by prior works in open-vocabulary action detection and devise a new benchmark to evaluate on existing closed-set action detection datasets without ever using them for training, showing novel results to serve as baselines for future work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.

  Recently, state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models, such as Flux and Ideogram 2.0, have made significant progress in sentence-level visual text rendering. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data.In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG.We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.

  Reconstructing clean, distractor-free 3D scenes from real-world captures remains a significant challenge, particularly in highly dynamic and cluttered settings such as egocentric videos. To tackle this problem, we introduce DeGauss, a simple and robust self-supervised framework for dynamic scene reconstruction based on a decoupled dynamic-static Gaussian Splatting design. DeGauss models dynamic elements with foreground Gaussians and static content with background Gaussians, using a probabilistic mask to coordinate their composition and enable independent yet complementary optimization. DeGauss generalizes robustly across a wide range of real-world scenarios, from casual image collections to long, dynamic egocentric videos, without relying on complex heuristics or extensive supervision. Experiments on benchmarks including NeRF-on-the-go, ADT, AEA, Hot3D, and EPIC-Fields demonstrate that DeGauss consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong baseline for generalizable, distractor-free 3D reconstructionin highly dynamic, interaction-rich environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When interacting with objects, humans effectively reason about which regions of objects are viable for an intended action, i.e., the affordance regions of the object. They can also account for subtle differences in object regions based on the task to be performed and whether one or two hands need to be used. However, current vision-based affordance prediction methods often reduce the problem to naive object part segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting affordance data from human activity video datasets. Our extracted 2HANDS dataset contains precise object affordance region segmentations and affordance class-labels as narrations of the activity performed. The data also accounts for bimanual actions, i.e., two hands co-ordinating and interacting with one or more objects. We present a VLM-based affordance prediction model, 2HandedAfforder, trained on the dataset and demonstrate superior performance over baselines in affordance region segmentation for various activities. Finally, we show that our predicted affordance regions are actionable, i.e., can be used by an agent performing a task, through demonstration in robotic manipulation scenarios.

  High-precision tiny object alignment remains a common and critical challenge for humanoid robots in real-world. To address this problem, this paper proposes a vision-based framework for precisely estimating and controlling the relative position between a handheld tool and a target object for humanoid robots, e.g., a screwdriver tip and a screw head slot. By fusing images from the head and torso cameras on a robot with its head joint angles, the proposed Transformer-based visual servoing method can correct the handheld tool's positional errors effectively, especially at a close distance. Experiments on M4-M8 screws demonstrate an average convergence error of 0.8-1.3 mm and a success rate of 93\%-100\%. Through comparative analysis, the results validate that this capability of high-precision tiny object alignment is enabled by the Distance Estimation Transformer architecture and the Multi-Perception-Head mechanism proposed in this paper.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Augmented reality assembly guidance is essential for intelligent manufacturing and medical applications, requiring continuous measurement of the 6DoF poses of manipulated objects. Although current tracking methods have made significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, they still face challenges in robustness when dealing with cluttered backgrounds, rotationally symmetric objects, and noisy sequences. In this paper, we first propose a robust contour-based pose tracking method that addresses error-prone contour correspondences and improves noise tolerance. It utilizes a fan-shaped search strategy to refine correspondences and models local contour shape and noise uncertainty as mixed probability distribution, resulting in a highly robust contour energy function. Secondly, we introduce a CPU-only strategy to better track rotationally symmetric objects and assist the contour-based method in overcoming local minima by exploring sparse interior correspondences. This is achieved by pre-sampling interior points from sparse viewpoint templates offline and using the DIS optical flow algorithm to compute their correspondences during tracking. Finally, we formulate a unified energy function to fuse contour and interior information, which is solvable using a re-weighted least squares algorithm. Experiments on public datasets and real scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art monocular tracking methods and can achieve more than 100 FPS using only a CPU.

  Do the rich representations of multi-modal diffusion transformers (DiTs) exhibit unique properties that enhance their interpretability? We introduce ConceptAttention, a novel method that leverages the expressive power of DiT attention layers to generate high-quality saliency maps that precisely locate textual concepts within images. Without requiring additional training, ConceptAttention repurposes the parameters of DiT attention layers to produce highly contextualized concept embeddings, contributing the major discovery that performing linear projections in the output space of DiT attention layers yields significantly sharper saliency maps compared to commonly used cross-attention maps. ConceptAttention even achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot image segmentation benchmarks, outperforming 15 other zero-shot interpretability methods on the ImageNet-Segmentation dataset. ConceptAttention works for popular image models and even seamlessly generalizes to video generation. Our work contributes the first evidence that the representations of multi-modal DiTs are highly transferable to vision tasks like segmentation.

  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation attempts to classify and outline objects in an image using arbitrary text labels, including those unseen during training. Self-supervised learning resolves numerous visual and linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigates simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposes "Beyond-Labels", a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a small amount of image segmentation data to fuse frozen visual representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to leverage the extensive knowledge of pre-trained models without requiring significant retraining, making the approach data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we capture positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, improving generalization and enabling smooth and consistent spatial encoding. We perform thorough ablation studies to examine the main components of our proposed method. On the standard benchmark PASCAL-5i, the method performs better despite being trained on frozen vision and language representations.Index Terms: Beyond-Labels, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, Fourier embeddings, PASCAL-5i

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Significant progress has been made in the field of video question answering (VideoQA) thanks to deep learning and large-scale pretraining. Despite the presence of sophisticated model structures and powerful video-text foundation models, most existing methods focus solely on maximizing the correlation between answers and video-question pairs during training. We argue that these models often establish shortcuts, resulting in spurious correlations between questions and answers, especially when the alignment between video and text data is suboptimal. To address these spurious correlations, we propose a novel training framework in which the model is compelled to acknowledge its ignorance when presented with an intervened question, rather than making guesses solely based on superficial question-answer correlations. We introduce methodologies for intervening in questions, utilizing techniques such as displacement and perturbation, and design frameworks for the model to admit its lack of knowledge in both multi-choice VideoQA and open-ended settings. In practice, we integrate a state-of-the-art model into our framework to validate its effectiveness. The results clearly demonstrate that our framework can significantly enhance the performance of VideoQA models with minimal structural modifications.

  Temporal embryo images and parental fertility table indicators are both valuable for pregnancy prediction in \textbf{in vitro fertilization embryo transfer} (IVF-ET). However, current machine learning models cannot make full use of the complementary information between the two modalities to improve pregnancy prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a Decoupling Fusion Network called DeFusion to effectively integrate the multi-modal information for IVF-ET pregnancy prediction. Specifically, we propose a decoupling fusion module that decouples the information from the different modalities into related and unrelated information, thereby achieving a more delicate fusion. And we fuse temporal embryo images with a spatial-temporal position encoding, and extract fertility table indicator information with a table transformer. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we use a new dataset including 4046 cases collected from Southern Medical University. The experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the performance on the eye disease prediction dataset reflects the model's good generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data-free quantization (DFQ) enables model quantization without accessing real data, addressing concerns regarding data security and privacy. With the growing adoption of Vision Transformers (ViTs), DFQ for ViTs has garnered significant attention. However, existing DFQ methods exhibit two limitations: (1) semantic distortion, where the semantics of synthetic images deviate substantially from those of real images, and (2) semantic inadequacy, where synthetic images contain extensive regions with limited content and oversimplified textures, leading to suboptimal quantization performance. To address these limitations, we propose SARDFQ, a novel Semantics Alignment and Reinforcement Data-Free Quantization method for ViTs. To address semantic distortion, SARDFQ incorporates Attention Priors Alignment (APA), which optimizes synthetic images to follow randomly generated structure attention priors. To mitigate semantic inadequacy, SARDFQ introduces Multi-Semantic Reinforcement (MSR), leveraging localized patch optimization to enhance semantic richness across synthetic images. Furthermore, SARDFQ employs Soft-Label Learning (SL), wherein multiple semantic targets are adapted to facilitate the learning of multi-semantic images augmented by MSR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SARDFQ, significantly surpassing existing methods. For example, SARDFQ improves top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 15.52% for W4A4 ViT-B.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of neural networks by basing predictions on human-understandable concepts. However, current CBMs typically rely on concept sets extracted from large language models or extensive image corpora, limiting their effectiveness in data-sparse scenarios. We propose Data-efficient CBMs (DCBMs), which reduce the need for large sample sizes during concept generation while preserving interpretability. DCBMs define concepts as image regions detected by segmentation or detection foundation models, allowing each image to generate multiple concepts across different granularities. This removes reliance on textual descriptions and large-scale pre-training, making DCBMs applicable for fine-grained classification and out-of-distribution tasks. Attribution analysis using Grad-CAM demonstrates that DCBMs deliver visual concepts that can be localized in test images. By leveraging dataset-specific concepts instead of predefined ones, DCBMs enhance adaptability to new domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Textual-based prompt learning methods primarily employ multiple learnable soft prompts and hard class tokens in a cascading manner as text inputs, aiming to align image and text (category) spaces for downstream tasks. However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-anchored Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward differentiable attribute search method to identify representative and suitable attributes for downstream tasks. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing basic prompt format in textual-based methods, providing general improvements at a negligible computational cost. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI. Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts on unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework, called \textit{SURE-VQA}, centered around three key requirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM robustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models (LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the robustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets with four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into robustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and 2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution shifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the image data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the best-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into meaningful features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, mapping each image back to its approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial Gaussian noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image regions. As a consequence of this divergence, we present that the space of image inversions is notably less manipulative than the original Gaussian noise. Next, we explain the origin of the phenomenon, demonstrating that, during the first inversion steps, the noise prediction error is much more significant for the plain areas than for the rest of the image. As a surprisingly simple solution, we propose to replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, which successfully decorrelates latent encodings, leading to higher quality editions and interpolations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) learn a latent space whose samples can be mapped to real-world images. Such latent spaces are difficult to interpret. Some earlier supervised methods aim to create an interpretable latent space or discover interpretable directions, which requires exploiting data labels or annotated synthesized samples for training. However, we propose using a modification of vector quantization called space-filling vector quantization (SFVQ), which quantizes the data on a piece-wise linear curve. SFVQ can capture the underlying morphological structure of the latent space, making it interpretable. We apply this technique to model the latent space of pre-trained StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks on various datasets. Our experiments show that the SFVQ curve yields a general interpretable model of the latent space such that it determines which parts of the latent space correspond to specific generative factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each line of the SFVQ curve can potentially refer to an interpretable direction for applying intelligible image transformations. We also demonstrate that the points located on an SFVQ line can be used for controllable data augmentation.

  The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational model for image segmentation tasks, known for its strong generalization across diverse applications. However, its impressive performance comes with significant computational and resource demands, making it challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments such as edge devices. To address this, a variety of SAM variants have been proposed to enhance efficiency while keeping accuracy. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of these efficient SAM variants. We begin by exploring the motivations driving this research. We then present core techniques used in SAM and model acceleration. This is followed by a detailed exploration of SAM acceleration strategies, categorized by approach, and a discussion of several future research directions. Finally, we offer a unified and extensive evaluation of these methods across various hardware, assessing their efficiency and accuracy on representative benchmarks, and providing a clear comparison of their overall performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Micro-expressions are subtle facial movements that occur spontaneously when people try to conceal real emotions. Micro-expression recognition is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy. However, micro-expression recognition is challenging since micro-expressions have low intensity and public datasets are small in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network based on self-knowledge distillation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to address the low intensity of muscle movements, we utilize learning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of muscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention modules in the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that are highly relevant to micro-expressions. In addition, temporal shift modules are used in the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no additional parameters by mixing motion information from two different temporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation into the micro-expression recognition task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest section of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore the features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on five publicly available micro-expression datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms other existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Teeth segmentation and recognition play a vital role in a variety of dental applications and diagnostic procedures. The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. In addition, this paper presents the OralBBNet architecture, which is based on the best segmentation and detection qualities of architectures such as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for tooth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions for various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score compared to other SOTA segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained prominence for its superior relational modeling prowess. However, its global attention mechanism's quadratic complexity poses substantial computational burdens. A common remedy spatially groups tokens for self-attention, reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, this strategy neglects semantic information in tokens, possibly scattering semantically-linked tokens across distinct groups, thus compromising the efficacy of self-attention intended for modeling inter-token dependencies. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a fast and balanced clustering method, named Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC). SEC clusters tokens based on their global semantic relevance in an efficient, straightforward manner. In contrast to traditional clustering methods requiring multiple iterations, our method achieves token clustering in a single pass. Additionally, SEC regulates the number of tokens per cluster, ensuring a balanced distribution for effective parallel processing on current computational platforms without necessitating further optimization. Capitalizing on SEC, we propose a versatile vision backbone, SECViT. Comprehensive experiments in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of SECViT. Moreover, SEC can be conveniently and swiftly applied to multimodal large language models (MLLM), such as LLaVA, to serve as a vision language connector, effectively accelerating the model's efficiency while maintaining unchanged or better performance.

  Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation often produce overconfident results misaligned with empirical observations. Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset. We share our code here:this https URL

  Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to generate a compact synthetic dataset that enables models to achieve performance comparable to training on the full large dataset, significantly reducing computational costs. Drawing from optimal transport theory, we introduce WMDD (Wasserstein Metric-based Dataset Distillation), a straightforward yet powerful method that employs the Wasserstein metric to enhance distribution matching.We compute the Wasserstein barycenter of features from a pretrained classifier to capture essential characteristics of the original data distribution. By optimizing synthetic data to align with this barycenter in feature space and leveraging per-class BatchNorm statistics to preserve intra-class variations, WMDD maintains the efficiency of distribution matching approaches while achieving state-of-the-art results across various high-resolution datasets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate WMDD's effectiveness and adaptability, highlighting its potential for advancing machine learning applications at scale.

  In this paper, we propose a novel network framework for indoor 3D object detection to handle variable input frame numbers in practical scenarios. Existing methods only consider fixed frames of input data for a single detector, such as monocular RGB-D images or point clouds reconstructed from dense multi-view RGB-D images. While in practical application scenes such as robot navigation and manipulation, the raw input to the 3D detectors is the RGB-D images with variable frame numbers instead of the reconstructed scene point cloud. However, the previous approaches can only handle fixed frame input data and have poor performance with variable frame input. In order to facilitate 3D object detection methods suitable for practical tasks, we present a novel 3D detection framework named AnyView for our practical applications, which generalizes well across different numbers of input frames with a single model. To be specific, we propose a geometric learner to mine the local geometric features of each input RGB-D image frame and implement local-global feature interaction through a designed spatial mixture module. Meanwhile, we further utilize a dynamic token strategy to adaptively adjust the number of extracted features for each frame, which ensures consistent global feature density and further enhances the generalization after fusion. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset show our method achieves both great generalizability and high detection accuracy with a simple and clean architecture containing a similar amount of parameters with the baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a cross-topic of multi-view learning and multi-label classification, multi-view multi-label classification has gradually gained traction in recent years. The application of multi-view contrastive learning has further facilitated this process, however, the existing multi-view contrastive learning methods crudely separate the so-called negative pair, which largely results in the separation of samples belonging to the same category or similar ones. Besides, plenty of multi-view multi-label learning methods ignore the possible absence of views and labels. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an incomplete multi-view missing multi-label classification network named RANK. In this network, a label-driven multi-view contrastive learning strategy is proposed to leverage supervised information to preserve the intra-view structure and perform the cross-view consistency alignment. Furthermore, we break through the view-level weights inherent in existing methods and propose a quality-aware sub-network to dynamically assign quality scores to each view of each sample. The label correlation information is fully utilized in the final multi-label cross-entropy classification loss, effectively improving the discriminative power. Last but not least, our model is not only able to handle complete multi-view multi-label data, but also works on datasets with missing instances and labels. Extensive experiments confirm that our RANK outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

  We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model (SPRM). Through sharing the backbone network and using task-specific heads for next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have open-sourced MetaStone-S1 atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection, they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

  We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

  Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short- and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU). This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal processing at the edge.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results, demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae, the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves promising results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel approach to knowledge transfer in model-based reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M parameter model score of 18.93. This improvement demonstrates the ability of our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task knowledge. We further optimize the distilled model through FP16 post-training quantization, reducing its size by $\sim$50\%. Our approach addresses practical deployment limitations and offers insights into knowledge representation in large world models, paving the way for more efficient and accessible multi-task reinforcement learning systems in robotics and other resource-constrained applications.

  Foundation models are at the forefront of AI research, appealing for their ability to learn from vast datasets and cater to diverse tasks. Yet, their significant computational demands raise issues of environmental impact and the risk of centralized control in their development. We put forward a vision towards decentralized and sustainable foundation model training that leverages the collective compute of sparingly used connected edge AI devices. We present the rationale behind our vision, particularly in support of its sustainability benefit. We further outline a set of challenges that need to be addressed to turn this vision into reality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture, training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

  The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization, fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings. This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined. Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii) vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the computational domain.In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets. To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

  Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph Convolutional Networks and the accuracy of the models at the same time. Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks. We estimate uncertainty in both outputs and layer-wise attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading analysis and the skeleton-based human action recognition tasks on the Finnish board membership, NTU-60, NTU-120 and Kinetics datasets, where we show improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus, carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

  While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges, we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces, offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization, editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters. We provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and without Nesterov momentum, and with and without weight decay. We then show that adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and gradient norms, and we clarify the relationship between the weight decay coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive Muon's critical batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic computational cost, and validate our theoretical findings with experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns sequentially at transfer time.

  Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward \textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and \textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately $1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking. Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial implementation.

  Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision, audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model, achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or requiring any domain-specific training.

  Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

  This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate incentives.

  We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much earlier.Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism, which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a "Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs second-task-token performance.

  Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

  Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness, attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models, contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

  In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations? We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task - preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen, independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into specialist multimodal models.

They posses striking geometric properties that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source and a live demo is available atthis http URL.

  The scientific computation methods development in conjunction with artificial intelligence technologies remains a hot research topic. Finding a balance between lightweight and accurate computations is a solid foundation for this direction. The study presents a neural operator based on the dynamic mode decomposition algorithm (DMD), mapping functional spaces, which combines DMD and deep learning (DL) for spatiotemporal processes efficient modeling. Solving PDEs for various initial and boundary conditions requires significant computational resources. The method suggested automatically extracts key modes and system dynamics using them to construct predictions, reducing computational costs compared to traditional numerical methods. The approach has demonstrated its efficiency through comparative analysis of performance with closest analogues DeepONet and FNO in the heat equation, Laplaces equation, and Burgers equation solutions approximation, where it achieves high reconstruction accuracy.

  _Bogdan Bogdan, Arina Cazacu, Laura Vasilie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection accuracy in complex communication environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study leverages an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset to develop explainable AI methods for the early detection and prediction of Freezing of Gait (FOG), a common symptom in Parkinson's disease. Machine learning models, including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers, are employed to accurately categorize FOG episodes based on relevant clinical features. A Stacking Ensemble model achieves superior performance, surpassing a hybrid bidirectional GRU model and reaching nearly 99% classification accuracy. SHAP interpretability analysis reveals that time (seconds) is the most influential factor in distinguishing gait patterns. Additionally, the proposed FOG prediction framework incorporates federated learning, where models are trained locally on individual devices and aggregated on a central server using a federated averaging approach, utilizing a hybrid Conv1D + LSTM architecture for enhanced predictive capability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index (IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data, including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

  The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

  In the oil industry, undesirable events in oil wells can cause economic losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties. Solutions based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Early Detection of such events have proven valuable for diverse applications across industries. In 2019, recognizing the importance and the lack of public datasets related to undesirable events in oil wells, Petrobras developed and publicly released the first version of the 3W Dataset, which is essentially a set of Multivariate Time Series labeled by experts. Since then, the 3W Dataset has been developed collaboratively and has become a foundational reference for numerous works in the field. This data article describes the current publicly available version of the 3W Dataset, which contains structural modifications and additional labeled data. The detailed description provided encourages and supports the 3W community and new 3W users to improve previous published results and to develop new robust methodologies, digital products and services capable of detecting undesirable events in oil wells with enough anticipation to enable corrective or mitigating actions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained. The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets, demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility. Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the method's robustness and adaptability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper, we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by 24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1 environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000 updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in reinforcement learning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants: non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate), autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy, with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably, L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding, generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

  In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar FGM utilizing machine learning algorithms for application in combustion simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2. Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors, leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual understanding and reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB) algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization. For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of 14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS), which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes. Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead) sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an 16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead. Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on 256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously intractable sequence lengths.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in certain real-world industrial applications, yet its broader deployment remains limited by inherent challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable learning dynamics. This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence. Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration for robust and effective personalization.

  _Peihao Wang, Zhangyang Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

  We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

  Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL, often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

  The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While internet-scale image and textual data have enabled strong generalization in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the absence of internet-scale control data has impeded the development of similar generalization in standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called sub-trajectory filtered optimization. We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex reinforcement learning from human feedback-based methods. We propose sub-trajectory filtered behavior cloning, a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence. This study is preliminary; we provide initial evidence through evaluations on a toy control domain. Please enjoy our airport puns.

  Monitoring real-time air quality is essential for safeguarding public health and fostering social progress. However, the widespread deployment of air quality monitoring stations is constrained by their significant costs. To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{AirRadar}, a deep neural network designed to accurately infer real-time air quality in locations lacking monitoring stations by utilizing data from existing ones. By leveraging learnable mask tokens, AirRadar reconstructs air quality features in unmonitored regions. Specifically, it operates in two stages: first capturing spatial correlations and then adjusting for distribution shifts. We validate AirRadar's efficacy using a year-long dataset from 1,085 monitoring stations across China, demonstrating its superiority over multiple baselines, even with varying degrees of unobserved data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games), abnormal players (bots) using unauthorized automated programs to carry out pre-defined behaviors systematically and repeatedly are commonly observed. Bots usually engage in these activities to gain in-game money, which they eventually trade for real money outside the game. Such abusive activities negatively impact the in-game experiences of legitimate users since bots monopolize specific hunting areas and obtain valuable items. Thus, detecting abnormal players is a significant task for game companies. Motivated by the fact that bots tend to behave collectively with similar in-game trajectories due to the auto-programs, we developed BotTRep, a framework that comprises trajectory representation learning followed by clustering using a completely unlabeled in-game trajectory dataset. Our model aims to learn representations for in-game trajectory sequences so that players with contextually similar trajectories have closer embeddings. Then, by applying DBSCAN to these representations and visualizing the corresponding moving patterns, our framework ultimately assists game masters in identifying and banning bots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability and performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse offline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also limit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism on offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is unnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for fine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by analyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find that continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a sudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by a distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This divergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of offline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple idea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very small number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The data collected during warmup helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to the online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without destabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune without retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains higher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain offline data or not.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weights required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore directly updating the quantized low-precision weights without relying on straight-through estimation during backpropagation, aiming to save memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize the information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models of various sizes indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values; (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits achieves performance on par with BitNet b1.58; (3) our models remain robust to precision scaling and memory reduction, showing minimal performance degradation when moving from FP32 to lower-memory environments (BF16/FP8); and (4) our models also support inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an initialization method that can approximate a given approximate Ising model with a high degree of accuracy using a factorization machine (FM), a machine learning model. The construction of an Ising models using an FM is applied to black-box combinatorial optimization problems using factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA). It is anticipated that the optimization performance of FMQA will be enhanced through an implementation of the warm-start method. Nevertheless, the optimal initialization method for leveraging the warm-start approach in FMQA remains undetermined. Consequently, the present study compares initialization methods based on random initialization and low-rank approximation, and then identifies a suitable one for use with warm-start in FMQA through numerical experiments. Furthermore, the properties of the initialization method by the low-rank approximation for the FM are analyzed using random matrix theory, demonstrating that the approximation accuracy of the proposed method is not significantly influenced by the specific Ising model under consideration. The findings of this study will facilitate advancements of research in the field of black-box combinatorial optimization through the use of Ising machines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove specific knowledge from a trained model. Existing approaches, such as Task Arithmetic, fine-tune the model on the forget set to create a task vector (i.e., a direction in weight space) for subtraction from the original model's weight. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to hyperparameter selection, requiring extensive validation to identify the optimal vector from many fine-tuned candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel method that utilizes all fine-tuned models trained with varying hyperparameters instead of a single selection. Specifically, we aggregate the computed task vectors by retaining only the elements with consistent shared signs. The merged task vector is then negated to induce unlearning on the original model. Evaluations on zero-shot and standard image recognition tasks across twelve datasets and four backbone architectures show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring similar or fewer computational resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning algorithms aim to efficiently remove data from a model without retraining it from scratch, in order to remove corrupted or outdated data or respect a user's ``right to be forgotten." Certified machine unlearning is a strong theoretical guarantee based on differential privacy that quantifies the extent to which an algorithm erases data from the model weights. In contrast to existing works in certified unlearning for convex or strongly convex loss functions, or nonconvex objectives with limiting assumptions, we propose the first, first-order, black-box (i.e., can be applied to models pretrained with vanilla gradient descent) algorithm for unlearning on general nonconvex loss functions, which unlearns by ``rewinding" to an earlier step during the learning process before performing gradient descent on the loss function of the retained data points. We prove $(\epsilon, \delta)$ certified unlearning and performance guarantees that establish the privacy-utility-complexity tradeoff of our algorithm, and we prove generalization guarantees for functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods, within a new experimental framework that more accurately reflects unlearning user data in practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a theoretical framework to evaluate and compare the performance of stochastic gradient algorithms for distributed learning in relation to their behavior around local minima in nonconvex environments. Previous works have noticed that convergence toward flat local minima tend to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms. This work discovers three interesting results. First, it shows that decentralized learning strategies are able to escape faster away from local minima and favor convergence toward flatter minima relative to the centralized solution. Second, in decentralized methods, the consensus strategy has a worse excess-risk performance than diffusion, giving it a better chance of escaping from local minima and favoring flatter minima. Third, and importantly, the ultimate classification accuracy is not solely dependent on the flatness of the local minimum but also on how well a learning algorithm can approach that minimum. In other words, the classification accuracy is a function of both flatness and optimization performance. In this regard, since diffusion has a lower excess-risk than consensus, when both algorithms are trained starting from random initial points, diffusion enhances the classification accuracy. The paper examines the interplay between the two measures of flatness and optimization error closely. One important conclusion is that decentralized strategies deliver in general enhanced classification accuracy because they strike a more favorable balance between flatness and optimization performance compared to the centralized solution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Consistency models imitate the multi-step sampling of score-based diffusion in a single forward pass of a neural network. They can be learned in two ways: consistency distillation and consistency training. The former relies on the true velocity field of the corresponding differential equation, approximated by a pre-trained neural network. In contrast, the latter uses a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of this velocity field. The related estimation error induces a discrepancy between consistency distillation and training that, we show, still holds in the continuous-time limit. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel flow that transports noisy data towards their corresponding outputs derived from a consistency model. We prove that this flow reduces the previously identified discrepancy and the noise-data transport cost. Consequently, our method not only accelerates consistency training convergence but also enhances its overall performance. The code is available at:this https URL.

  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.

  A growing trend has emerged in designing high-quality Small Language Models (SLMs) with a few million parameters. This trend is driven by the increasing concerns over cloud costs, privacy, and latency. Considering that full parameter training is feasible for SLMs on mobile devices, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is employed to improve efficiency by reducing computational overhead and memory footprint. However, previous QAT works adopt fine-grained quantization methods to compress models with billions of parameters on GPUs, incompatible with current commodity hardware, such as mobile and edge devices, which relies on Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Thus, the generalization of these methods to SLMs on mobile devices is limited. In this paper, we propose Squat method, an effective QAT framework with deployable quantization for SLMs on mobile devices. Specifically, we propose entropy-guided and distribution-aligned distillation to mitigate the distortion of attention information from quantization. Besides, we employ sub-8-bit token adaptive quantization, assigning varying bit widths to different tokens based on their importance. Furthermore, we develop a SIMD-based Multi-Kernel Mixed-Precision (MKMP) multiplier to support sub-8-bit mixed-precision MAC on mobile devices. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements of our method compared to other QAT methods across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts, signaling a great advancement. Code:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an autonomous guidance and control strategy for a satellite swarm that enables scalable distributed space structures for innovative science and business opportunities. The averaged $J_2$ orbital parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces, thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a $J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.

We develop the first implementation of this proposal and conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge, reasoning and mathematical datasets. The results show that our system can be competitive with the SOTA static and dynamic MASs by achieving the best average performance, and at the same time manage to spend less tokens. Our proposal has the potential to enable complex and dynamic problem-solving where well-defined structures or workflows are unavailable.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.

  Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in intelligent transportation systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous studies that have formulated multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have primarily used value-based RL methods. However, recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world normally signal timing plans because of the simplifying assumptions common in the literature. The current study attempts to address these gaps and formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has a centralized-critic architecture under a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Agents are designed to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases, as commonly implemented in field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world seven intersection corridor. The speed of convergence for each agent was found to depend on the size of the action space, which depends on the number and sequence of signal phases. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented actuated-coordinated signal control (ASC), modeled using PTV-Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The trained MA-PPO performed significantly better than the ASC for all movements. Compared to ASC the MA-PPO showed 2% and 24% improvements in travel time in the primary and secondary coordination directions, respectively. For cross streets movements MA-PPO also showed significant crossing time reductions. Volume sensitivity experiments revealed that the formulated MA-PPO demonstrated good stability, robustness, and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study pursuit-evasion games in highly occluded urban environments, e.g. tall buildings in a city, where a scout (quadrotor) tracks multiple dynamic targets on the ground. We show that we can build a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation of the city -- online -- using RGB and depth images from different vantage points. This representation is used to calculate the information gain to both explore unknown parts of the city and track the targets -- thereby giving a completely first-principles approach to actively tracking dynamic targets. We demonstrate, using a custom-built simulator using Open Street Maps data of Philadelphia and New York City, that we can explore and locate 20 stationary targets within 300 steps. This is slower than a greedy baseline, which does not use active perception. But for dynamic targets that actively hide behind occlusions, we show that our approach maintains, at worst, a tracking error of 200m; the greedy baseline can have a tracking error as large as 600m. We observe a number of interesting properties in the scout's policies, e.g., it switches its attention to track a different target periodically, as the quality of the NeRF representation improves over time, the scout also becomes better in terms of target tracking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized robotic autonomy, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs for translating human instructions into executable control code for UAV operations. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.

  The remarkable advancements of vision and language foundation models in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation has sparked growing efforts to extend such intelligence to the physical world, fueling the flourishing of vision-language-action (VLA) models. Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation, raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for real-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM (Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.

  _Dmytro Kuzmenko, Nadiya Shvai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have recently gained traction in robotics applications due to their ability to dynamically allocate computational resources and specialize sub-networks for distinct tasks or environmental contexts, enabling more efficient decision-making. Such systems often comprise sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router. MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts, and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current pelvic fixation techniques rely on rigid drilling tools, which inherently constrain the placement of rigid medical screws in the complex anatomy of pelvis. These constraints prevent medical screws from following anatomically optimal pathways and force clinicians to fixate screws in linear trajectories. This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement of the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw misplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to repeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4 degree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic CT-SDR). The pelvic CT-SDR is capable of creating long S-shaped drilling trajectories that follow the natural curvatures of the pelvic anatomy. The performance of the pelvic CT-SDR was thoroughly evaluated through several S-shape drilling experiments in simulated bone phantoms.

  In this paper, we introduce S3D: A Spatial Steerable Surgical Drilling Framework for Robotic Spinal Fixation Procedures. S3D is designed to enable realistic steerable drilling while accounting for the anatomical constraints associated with vertebral access in spinal fixation (SF) procedures. To achieve this, we first enhanced our previously designed concentric tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) to facilitate steerable drilling across all vertebral levels of the spinal column. Additionally, we propose a four-Phase calibration, registration, and navigation procedure to perform realistic SF procedures on a spine holder phantom by integrating the CT-SDR with a seven-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The functionality of this framework is validated through planar and out-of-plane steerable drilling experiments in vertebral phantoms.

  To address the screw loosening and pullout limitations of rigid pedicle screws in spinal fixation procedures, and to leverage our recently developed Concentric Tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) and Flexible Pedicle Screw (FPS), in this paper, we introduce the concept of Augmented Bridge Spinal Fixation (AB-SF). In this concept, two connecting J-shape tunnels are first drilled through pedicles of vertebra using the CT-SDR. Next, two FPSs are passed through this tunnel and bone cement is then injected through the cannulated region of the FPS to form an augmented bridge between two pedicles and reinforce strength of the fixated spine. To experimentally analyze and study the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system (i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation scenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at different depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the drilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation process.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion Policies are effective at learning closed-loop manipulation policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue, we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene. Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency. In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Collision-free motion planning in complex outdoor environments relies heavily on perceiving the surroundings through exteroceptive sensors. A widely used approach represents the environment as a voxelized Euclidean distance field, where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links, this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate. This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane application, as well as simulated environment data.

  Shape-morphing robots have shown benefits in industrial grasping. We propose form-flexible grippers for adaptive grasping. The design is based on the hybrid jamming and suction mechanism, which deforms to handle objects that vary significantly in size from the aperture, including both larger and smaller parts. Compared with traditional grippers, the gripper achieves self-closing to form an airtight seal. Under a vacuum, a wide range of grasping is realized through the passive morphing mechanism at the interface that harmonizes pressure and flow rate. This hybrid gripper showcases the capability to securely grasp an egg, as small as 54.5% of its aperture, while achieving a maximum load-to-mass ratio of 94.3.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.

  Accurate motion forecasting is critical for safe and efficient autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.Index Terms-Autonomous driving, trajectory prediction, vector map elements, road topology, connection pruning, Argoverse 2.

  Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous vehicles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in enabling quadruped robots to perform agile locomotion. However, directly training policies to simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm. JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and extreme terrains.

  In many robotics applications, it is necessary to compute not only the distance between the robot and the environment, but also its derivative - for example, when using control barrier functions. However, since the traditional Euclidean distance is not differentiable, there is a need for alternative distance metrics that possess this property. Recently, a metric with guaranteed differentiability was proposed [1]. This approach has some important drawbacks, which we address in this paper. We provide much simpler and practical expressions for the smooth projection for general convex polytopes. Additionally, as opposed to [1], we ensure that the distance vanishes as the objects overlap. We show the efficacy of the approach in experimental results. Our proposed distance metric is publicly available through the Python-based simulation package UAIBot.

  Ultrasound (US) is a widely used medical imaging modality due to its real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications. Dataset, codes, and videos are publicly available atthis https URL.

  We present VISTA (Viewpoint-based Image selection with Semantic Task Awareness), an active exploration method for robots to plan informative trajectories that improve 3D map quality in areas most relevant for task completion. Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., "find a person"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment. To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps, compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

  Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality, real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions, we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution, DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods, providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

  In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

  Multi-robot systems (MRSs) are valuable for tasks such as search and rescue due to their ability to coordinate over shared observations. A central challenge in these systems is aligning independently collected perception data across space and time, i.e., multi-robot data association. While recent advances in collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), map merging, and inter-robot loop closure detection have significantly progressed the field, evaluation strategies still predominantly rely on splitting a single trajectory from single-robot SLAM datasets into multiple segments to simulate multiple robots. Without careful consideration to how a single trajectory is split, this approach will fail to capture realistic pose-dependent variation in observations of a scene inherent to multi-robot systems. To address this gap, we present CU-Multi, a multi-robot dataset collected over multiple days at two locations on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Using a single robotic platform, we generate four synchronized runs with aligned start times and deliberate percentages of trajectory overlap. CU-Multi includes RGB-D, GPS with accurate geospatial heading, and semantically annotated LiDAR data. By introducing controlled variations in trajectory overlap and dense lidar annotations, CU-Multi offers a compelling alternative for evaluating methods in multi-robot data association.

  We introduce real-is-sim, a new approach to integrating simulation into behavior cloning pipelines. In contrast to real-only methods, which lack the ability to safely test policies before deployment, and sim-to-real methods, which require complex adaptation to cross the sim-to-real gap, our framework allows policies to seamlessly switch between running on real hardware and running in parallelized virtual environments. At the center of real-is-sim is a dynamic digital twin, powered by the Embodied Gaussian simulator, that synchronizes with the real world at 60Hz. This twin acts as a mediator between the behavior cloning policy and the real robot. Policies are trained using representations derived from simulator states and always act on the simulated robot, never the real one. During deployment, the real robot simply follows the simulated robot's joint states, and the simulation is continuously corrected with real world measurements. This setup, where the simulator drives all policy execution and maintains real-time synchronization with the physical world, shifts the responsibility of crossing the sim-to-real gap to the digital twin's synchronization mechanisms, instead of the policy itself. We demonstrate real-is-sim on a long-horizon manipulation task (PushT), showing that virtual evaluations are consistent with real-world results. We further show how real-world data can be augmented with virtual rollouts and compare to policies trained on different representations derived from the simulator state including object poses and rendered images from both static and robot-mounted cameras. Our results highlight the flexibility of the real-is-sim framework across training, evaluation, and deployment stages. Videos available atthis https URL.

  This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches. Project webpage:this https URL

  Real-world tasks such as garment manipulation and table rearrangement demand robots to perform generalizable, highly precise, and long-horizon actions. Although imitation learning has proven to be an effective approach for teaching robots new skills, large amounts of expert demonstration data are still indispensible for these complex tasks, resulting in high sample complexity and costly data collection. To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation Learning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtains semantic keypoints with the help of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic keypoints that enables efficient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks with significantly lower sample complexity. In real-world experiments, SKIL doubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or mouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects, environmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a towel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean success rate of 70\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL naturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints abstraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring considerable improvement to the learning performance. All these results demonstrate the great success of SKIL in achieving data-efficient generalizable robotic learning. Visualizations and code are available at:this https URL.

  Enabling embodied agents to complete complex human instructions from natural language is crucial to autonomous systems in household services. Conventional methods can only accomplish human instructions in the known environment where all interactive objects are provided to the embodied agent, and directly deploying the existing approaches for the unknown environment usually generates infeasible plans that manipulate non-existing objects. On the contrary, we propose an embodied instruction following (EIF) method for complex tasks in the unknown environment, where the agent efficiently explores the unknown environment to generate feasible plans with existing objects to accomplish abstract instructions. Specifically, we build a hierarchical embodied instruction following framework including the high-level task planner and the low-level exploration controller with multimodal large language models. We then construct a semantic representation map of the scene with dynamic region attention to demonstrate the known visual clues, where the goal of task planning and scene exploration is aligned for human instruction. For the task planner, we generate the feasible step-by-step plans for human goal accomplishment according to the task completion process and the known visual clues. For the exploration controller, the optimal navigation or object interaction policy is predicted based on the generated step-wise plans and the known visual clues. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve 45.09% success rate in 204 complex human instructions such as making breakfast and tidying rooms in large house-level scenes.

  Detailed and realistic 3D environment representations have been a long-standing goal in the fields of computer vision and robotics. The recent emergence of neural implicit representations has introduced significant advances to these domains, enabling numerous novel capabilities. Among these, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained considerable attention because of their considerable representational advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, low memory footprint, and continuous scene representations. In addition to computer vision, NeRFs have demonstrated significant potential in robotics. Thus, we present this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRFs in the field of robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF as well as its current applications and future potential, we aim to provide an overview of this promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections: \textit{Applications of NeRFs in Robotics} and \textit{Advances for NeRFs in Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could be used in robotics for perception and interaction tasks. In the second section, we show some works related to improving NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRFs in robotics. In the discussion section of the review, we summarize the existing challenges and provide valuable future research directions.

  This work views the multi-agent system and its surrounding environment as a co-evolving system, where the behavior of one affects the other. The goal is to take both agent actions and environment configurations as decision variables, and optimize these two components in a coordinated manner to improve some measure of interest. Towards this end, we consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent navigation in a cluttered environment, where we assume that the layout of the environment is reconfigurable. By introducing two sub-objectives -- multi-agent navigation and environment optimization -- we propose an agent-environment co-optimization problem and develop a coordinated algorithm that alternates between these sub-objectives to search for an optimal synthesis of agent actions and environment configurations; ultimately, improving the navigation performance. Due to the challenge of explicitly modeling the relation between the agents, the environment and their performance therein, we leverage policy gradient to formulate a model-free learning mechanism within the coordinated framework. A formal convergence analysis shows that our coordinated algorithm tracks the local minimum solution of an associated time-varying non-convex optimization problem. Experiments corroborate theoretical findings and show the benefits of co-optimization. Interestingly, the results also indicate that optimized environments can offer structural guidance to de-conflict agents in motion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents SCALER, a versatile free-climbing multi-limbed robot that is designed to achieve tightly coupled simultaneous locomotion and dexterous grasping. While existing quadrupedal-limbed robots have demonstrated impressive dexterous capabilities, achieving a balance between power-demanding locomotion and precise grasping remains a critical challenge. We design a torso mechanism and a parallel-serial limb to meet the conflicting requirements that pose unique challenges in hardware design. SCALER employs underactuated two-fingered GOAT grippers that can mechanically adapt and offer seven modes of grasping, enabling SCALER to traverse extreme terrains with multi-modal grasping strategies. We study the whole-body approach, where SCALER utilizes its body and limbs to generate additional forces for stable grasping in various environments, thereby further enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we improve the GOAT gripper actuation speed to realize more dynamic climbing in a closed-loop control fashion. With these proposed technologies, SCALER can traverse vertical, overhanging, upside-down, slippery terrains and bouldering walls with non-convex-shaped climbing holds under the Earth's gravity.
