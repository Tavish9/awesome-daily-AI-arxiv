- **[LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05263)**  `arXiv:2509.05263`  
  _Yinglin Duan, Zhengxia Zou, Tongwei Gu, Wei Jia, Zhan Zhao, Luyi Xu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

- **[Evaluation and Comparison Semantics for ODRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05139)**  `arXiv:2509.05139`  
  _Jaime Osvaldo Salas, Paolo Pareti, Semih Yumu≈üak, Soulmaz Gheisari, Luis-Daniel Ib√°√±ez, George Konstantinidis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing. In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2). Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios, we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

- **[ProToM: Promoting Prosocial Behaviour via Theory of Mind-Informed Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05091)**  `arXiv:2509.05091`  
  _Matteo Bortoletto, Yichao Zhou, Lance Ying, Tianmin Shu, Andreas Bulling_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted, context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents' goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors, Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed - leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate, shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Innovators often exhibit cognitive fixation on existing solutions or nascent ideas, hindering the exploration of novel alternatives. This paper introduces a methodology for constructing Functional Concept Graphs (FCGs), interconnected representations of functional elements that support abstraction, problem reframing, and analogical inspiration. Our approach yields large-scale, high-quality FCGs with explicit abstraction relations, overcoming limitations of prior work. We further present MUSE, an algorithm leveraging FCGs to generate creative inspirations for a given problem. We demonstrate our method by computing an FCG on 500K patents, which we release for further research.

- **[Sticker-TTS: Learn to Utilize Historical Experience with a Sticker-driven Test-Time Scaling Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05007)**  `arXiv:2509.05007`  
  _Jie Chen, Jinhao Jiang, Yingqian Min, Zican Dong, Shijie Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization, thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement, enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH, demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are available atthis https URL.

- **[Internet 3.0: Architecture for a Web-of-Agents with it's Algorithm for Ranking Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04979)**  `arXiv:2509.04979`  
  _Rajesh Tembarai Krishnamachari, Srividya Rajesh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist; usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without coordination.We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol (\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement \textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines \emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality, cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance, demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

- **[Towards Ontology-Based Descriptions of Conversations with Qualitatively-Defined Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04926)**  `arXiv:2509.04926`  
  _Barbara Gendron, Ga√´l Guibon, Mathieu D'aquin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

- **[OSC: Cognitive Orchestration through Dynamic Knowledge Alignment in Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04876)**  `arXiv:2509.04876`  
  _Jusheng Zhang, Yijia Fan, Kaitong Cai, Xiaofei Sun, Keze Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states. Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM agent interaction behaviors.

- **[Cloning a Conversational Voice AI Agent from Call\,Recording Datasets for Telesales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04871)**  `arXiv:2509.04871`  
  _Krittanon Kaewtawee, Wachiravit Modecrua, Krittin Pachtrachai, Touchapon Kraisingkorn_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks, reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and automated evaluation.

- **[Collaboration and Conflict between Humans and Language Models through the Lens of Game Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04847)**  `arXiv:2509.04847`  
  _Mukul Singh, Arjun Radhakrishna, Sumit Gulwani_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments, from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game. In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability. These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social environments.

- **[What-If Analysis of Large Language Models: Explore the Game World Using Proactive Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04791)**  `arXiv:2509.04791`  
  _Yuan Sui, Yanming Zhang, Yi Liao, Yu Gu, Guohua Tang, Zhongqian Sun, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask, "what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities. Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach. Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs. WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs, providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

- **[Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04731)**  `arXiv:2509.04731`  
  _Brennen Hill_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated, explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of 2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum, dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit, language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%.

- **[AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)**  `arXiv:2508.20368`  
  _Lang Mei, Zhihan Yang, Chong Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning. Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.

- **[MHSNet:An MoE-based Hierarchical Semantic Representation Network for Accurate Duplicate Resume Detection with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13676)**  `arXiv:2508.13676`  
  _Yu Li, Zulong Chen, Wenjian Xu, Hong Wen, Yipeng Yu, Man Lung Yiu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However, fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

  _Zhiyuan Zeng, Jiashuo Liu, Siyuan Chen, Tianci He, Yali Liao, Yixiao Tian, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources, weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and predictive thinking.

  _Zishang Qiu, Xinan Chen, Long Chen, Ruibin Bai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners, bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.

  _William F. Shen, Xinchi Qiu, Nicola Cancedda, Nicholas D. Lane_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing work on mitigating catastrophic forgetting during large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning for new knowledge instances has primarily focused on preserving performance on previously seen data, while critically overlooking the collapse of essential capabilities instilled through alignment, most notably the model's ability to faithfully express epistemic uncertainty (a property we term 'Ignorance Awareness'). In this work, we formalize the notion of Ignorance Awareness and illustrate that conventional fine-tuning methods can result in substantial activation displacement. This displacement undermines the critical capability of ignorance awareness, leading to undesirable behaviors such as hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce SEAT, a simple and principled fine-tuning approach that not only enables the model to effectively acquire new knowledge instances but also preserves its aligned ignorance awareness. SEAT integrates two key components: (1) sparse tuning that constrains activation drift, and (2) a novel entity perturbation method designed to counter knowledge entanglement. Experimental results demonstrate that, across both real-world and synthetic datasets, SEAT significantly outperforms baselines in preserving ignorance awareness while retaining optimal fine-tuning performance, offering a more robust solution for LLM fine-tuning.

  _Miroslav Popovic, Marko Popovic, Miodrag Djukic, Ilija Basicevic_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL framework that is easy to use by ML&AI developers who do not need to be professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper, a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and decentralized federated learning algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives -- cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich, interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation. This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched interpretations.

  We propose V-Droid, a mobile GUI task automation agent. Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale.V-Droid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 5.2%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves a remarkably low latency of 4.3s per step, which is 6.1X faster compared with existing mobile agents. The source code is available atthis https URL.

  As AI systems are becoming more and more popular and used in various critical domains (health, transport, energy, ...), the need to provide guarantees and trust of their safety is undeniable. To this end, we present PyRAT, a tool based on abstract interpretation to verify the safety and the robustness of neural networks. In this paper, we describe the different abstractions used by PyRAT to find the reachable states of a neural network starting from its input as well as the main features of the tool to provide fast and accurate analysis of neural networks. PyRAT has already been used in several collaborations to ensure safety guarantees, with its second place at the VNN-Comp 2024 showcasing its performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding (FKGE) aims to facilitate collaborative learning of entity and relation embeddings from distributed Knowledge Graphs (KGs) across multiple clients, while preserving data privacy. Training FKGE models with higher dimensions is typically favored due to their potential for achieving superior performance. However, high-dimensional embeddings present significant challenges in terms of storage resource and inference speed. Unlike traditional KG embedding methods, FKGE involves multiple client-server communication rounds, where communication efficiency is critical. Existing embedding compression methods for traditional KGs may not be directly applicable to FKGE as they often require multiple model trainings which potentially incur substantial communication costs. In this paper, we propose a light-weight component based on Knowledge Distillation (KD) which is titled FedKD and tailored specifically for FKGE methods. During client-side local training, FedKD facilitates the low-dimensional student model to mimic the score distribution of triples from the high-dimensional teacher model using KL divergence loss. Unlike traditional KD way, FedKD adaptively learns a temperature to scale the score of positive triples and separately adjusts the scores of corresponding negative triples using a predefined temperature, thereby mitigating teacher over-confidence issue. Furthermore, we dynamically adjust the weight of KD loss to optimize the training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets support the effectiveness of FedKD.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online movie review websites are valuable for information and discussion about movies. However, the massive spoiler reviews detract from the movie-watching experience, making spoiler detection an important task. Previous methods simply focus on reviews' text content, ignoring the heterogeneity of information in the platform. For instance, the metadata and the corresponding user's information of a review could be helpful. Besides, the spoiler language of movie reviews tends to be genre-specific, thus posing a domain generalization challenge for existing methods. To this end, we propose MMoE, a multi-modal network that utilizes information from multiple modalities to facilitate robust spoiler detection and adopts Mixture-of-Experts to enhance domain generalization. MMoE first extracts graph, text, and meta feature from the user-movie network, the review's textual content, and the review's metadata respectively. To handle genre-specific spoilers, we then adopt Mixture-of-Experts architecture to process information in three modalities to promote robustness. Finally, we use an expert fusion layer to integrate the features from different perspectives and make predictions based on the fused embedding. Experiments demonstrate that MMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely-used spoiler detection datasets, surpassing previous SOTA methods by 2.56% and 8.41% in terms of accuracy and F1-score. Further experiments also demonstrate MMoE's superiority in robustness and generalization. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Deniz Bayazit, Aaron Mueller, Antoine Bosselut_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout pretraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions: parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies, scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart. However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies, scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear attention mechanisms.

  _Hailin Hao, Elsi Kaiser_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction, we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information density. Our results replicated the established relationship between information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs' subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp, while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO) preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

  _Chang Dai, Hongyu Shan, Mingyang Song, Di Liang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1) recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1) popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected, identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning systems.

  In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across 33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects. Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31 language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs, do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs.We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing, evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services, showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and stakeholder roles.By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways, TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.

  In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world, causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared to other models. The code and dataset are available at:this https URL.

  Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

We evaluate our method on the BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.

  In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines, offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective response generation systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges: Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with limited compute resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained, adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands. Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints, converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally, we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation scenarios.

  In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

  _Sylvia Vassileva, Ivan Koychev, Svetla Boytcheva_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes. Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

  Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations (internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive insights for advancing their capabilities.

  Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings (GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient (DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score, and 85.50% overall accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000 high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity were tenuous or absent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs, enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash (50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models. Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash: 28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating "confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases, enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles, reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU, GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses. Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic diversity without sacrificing model quality.

  From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills. Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions, building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model, we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions. After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex questions.

  Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs (BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1, GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary, underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement, an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign language.

  Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+, a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195 predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9 million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included with the submission and is also available atthis https URL.

  _Adam Tauman Kalai, Ofir Nachum, Santosh S. Vempala, Edwin Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards, rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs, including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4 reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a comparative performance with reasoning-based models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs, posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD. Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$ when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as negatives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world social media text.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover, integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector -- placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio, video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e., satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules) with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs 64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality coverage of foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch, speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition, charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather than a text-based challenge.

  Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts, activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects. Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation. This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language models.

  Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12 state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90 structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66% train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24 organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1 0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning (F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$). Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference. Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening, stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

This capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or automated workflows.However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every usethis http URLa result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy, increasing their practical utility.

  Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling, postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance patient care.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories. Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME), revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%. BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes. Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs. borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance, particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings. However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller, on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical systems.

  Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off, we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the AppWorld environment using different sized language models.We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles, SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce subtask error rates.

  Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech, which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM) for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline, demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech interfaces.

  Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel ``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together, this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences. Project:this https URL

  Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models' sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers. Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be publicly released soon.

  This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy Evolution) are presented.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality. Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve, establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

  Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy, source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources, and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition, confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5,this http URL, Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure equitable global access to higher education.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR) metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1 score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive well-being monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering (QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection, specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top <10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on annual reports from an industrial dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead, generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens, achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442 tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842, all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

  Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics: \texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY}, designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

  Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives, performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design. Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of accurate personalized VER.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized ``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

  This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However, they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks. Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to further boost the generation performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer, sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width) is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5% for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient dimension for scaling future LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces, leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods. Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models (LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

  _Alice Schiavone, Marco Fraccaro, Lea Marie Pehrson, Silvia Ingala, Rasmus Bonnevie, Michael Bachmann Nielsen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets, approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86 with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

  We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations, identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown in the ToolBench API completion task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities: multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation, significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial certification evaluation.Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and cost-performance optimization.

  _Hao Zhang, Mengsi Lyu, Yulong Ao, Yonghua Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate \emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and \emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on ''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'', such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks. This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts' thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes. We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional escalation.

  _Yang Nan, Pengfei He, Ravi Tandon, Han Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that, when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question, a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering, its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached 94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734). In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines. These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as frontier models advance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and data will be publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty, are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis. Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to using a standalone MLLM.

  Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the strongest predictor of linking success.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

  The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked boundless possibilities, along with significant challenges. In response, we developed a mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application.

We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of 0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges. We advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach and a long-term, responsible strategy in developing such transformative technologies, recognizing both their potential to change lives and the risks they may pose if not carefully managed.

  Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses. Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex, real-world insurance scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion, our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

We examine these studies with respect to linguistic diversity, cultural awareness, and their choice of evaluation metrics and mitigation techniques. Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with state-of-the-art NLP advancements.

  Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant' persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description.

  Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning architectures to process and predict sequences of words, enabling them to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. As existing LLMs are often built from base models or other pre-trained models and use external datasets, they can inevitably inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components that exist in previous models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand these components' origin and development process to detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks. Motivated by that, this project aims to study such relationships between models and datasets, which are the central parts of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a methodology to systematically collect LLMs' supply chain information. Then, we design a new graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, which is a directed heterogeneous graph, having 402,654 nodes and 462,524 edges. Lastly, we perform different types of analysis and make multiple interesting findings.

Existing efforts in misinformation detection largely focus on written text, leaving a significant gap in addressing the complexity of spoken text in video transcripts. We introduce ViClaim, a dataset of 1,798 annotated video transcripts across three languages (English, German, Spanish) and six topics. Each sentence in the transcripts is labeled with three claim-related categories: fact-check-worthy, fact-non-check-worthy, or opinion. We developed a custom annotation tool to facilitate the highly complex annotation process. Experiments with state-of-the-art multilingual language models demonstrate strong performance in cross-validation (macro F1 up to 0.896) but reveal challenges in generalization to unseen topics, particularly for distinct domains. Our findings highlight the complexity of claim detection in video transcripts. ViClaim offers a robust foundation for advancing misinformation detection in video-based communication, addressing a critical gap in multimodal analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are now increasingly widely used to simulate personas in virtual environments, leveraging their instruction-following capability. However, we discovered that even state-of-the-art LLMs cannot simulate personas with reversed performance (e.g., student personas with low proficiency in educational settings), which impairs the simulation diversity and limits the practical applications of the simulated environments. In this work, using mathematical reasoning as a representative scenario, we propose the first benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs on simulating personas with reversed performance, a capability that we dub "counterfactual instruction following". We evaluate both open-weight and closed-source LLMs on this task and find that LLMs, including the OpenAI o1 reasoning model, all struggle to follow counterfactual instructions for simulating reversedly performing personas. Intersectionally simulating both the performance level and the race population of a persona worsens the effect even further. These results highlight the challenges of counterfactual instruction following and the need for further research.

  Recent math benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) such as MathArena indicate that state-of-the-art reasoning models achieve impressive performance on mathematical competitions like AIME, with the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving scores comparable to top human competitors. However, these benchmarks evaluate models solely based on final numerical answers, neglecting rigorous reasoning and proof generation which are essential for real-world mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation of full-solution reasoning for challenging mathematical problems. Using expert human annotators, we evaluated several state-of-the-art reasoning models on the six problems from the 2025 USAMO within hours of their release. Our results reveal that all tested models struggled significantly: only Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves a non-trivial score of 25%, while all other models achieve less than 5%. Through detailed analysis of reasoning traces, we identify the most common failure modes and find several unwanted artifacts arising from the optimization strategies employed during model training. Overall, our results suggest that current LLMs are inadequate for rigorous mathematical reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning and proof generation capabilities.

  Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science. Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern: a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized. Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the $50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. The remaining $76\%$ of documents show varying degrees of similarity with existing work, with only a small fraction appearing completely novel. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are inadequate at catching plagiarized ideas from such systems. We recommend a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of our findings on academic publishing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in clinical text summarization, but their ability to handle long patient trajectories with multi-modal data spread across time remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) variants and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on long-context clinical summarization and prediction. We examine their ability to synthesize structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data while reasoning over temporal coherence, by re-engineering existing tasks, including discharge summarization and diagnosis prediction from two publicly available EHR datasets. Our results indicate that long context windows improve input integration but do not consistently enhance clinical reasoning, and LLMs are still struggling with temporal progression and rare disease prediction. While RAG shows improvements in hallucination in some cases, it does not fully address these limitations. Our work fills the gap in long clinical text summarization, establishing a foundation for evaluating LLMs with multi-modal data and temporal reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent successful paradigm of solving logical reasoning problems with tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverages translation of natural language (NL) statements into First-Order Logic~(FOL) and external theorem provers. However, the correctness of FOL statements, comprising operators and text, often go unverified due to the lack of a reliable evaluation metric for comparing generated and ground-truth FOLs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the sensitivity of existing NL-, FOL-, and graph-based metrics to capture differences between a sampled FOL and its corresponding ground-truth. We then measure the alignment between a metric-based ranking of FOL outputs and a strong LLM as-a-judge. To do this, we first apply operator and text-based perturbations to ground-truth FOL statements to assess metric sensitivity. We then evaluate metric robustness by comparing the metrics against LLMs judgment. Our empirical findings highlight a clear oversensitivity in the n-gram metric BLEU for text perturbations. The operator perturbation affects the semantic graph metric Smatch++ for structural changes, and the FOL metric for specific operator changes. We observe a closer alignment between BertScore and LLM judgement, proving the importance of semantic evaluation. Additionally, we show that combining metrics enhances both robustness and sensitivity compared to using individual metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is a strong correlation between linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI), best manifested by deep learning language models. This study provides a thorough scientometric analysis of this correlation, synthesizing the intellectual production over 51 years, from 1974 to 2024. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was the data source. The data collected were analyzed by two powerful software, viz., CiteSpace and VOSviewer, through which mapping visualizations of the intellectual landscape, trending issues and (re)emerging hotspots were generated. The results indicate that in the 1980s and 1990s, linguistics and AI (AIL) research was not robust, characterized by unstable publication over time. It has, however, witnessed a remarkable increase of publication since then, reaching 1478 articles in 2023, and 546 articles in January-March timespan in 2024, involving emerging issues including Natural language processing, Cross-sectional study, Using bidirectional encoder representation, and Using ChatGPT and hotspots such as Novice programmer, Prioritization, and Artificial intelligence, addressing new horizons, new topics, and launching new applications and powerful deep learning language models including ChatGPT. It concludes that linguistics and AI correlation is established at several levels, research centers, journals, and countries shaping AIL knowledge production and reshaping its future frontiers.

  In this paper, we propose a new data synthesis method called \textbf{LogicPro}, which leverages LeetCode-style algorithm \underline{Pro}blems and their corresponding \underline{Pro}gram solutions to synthesize Complex \underline{Logic}al Reasoning data in text format. First, we synthesize complex reasoning problems through source algorithm problems and test cases. Then, standard answers and intermediate variable outputs are obtained for each problem based on standard python solutions and test cases. Finally, with the guidance of code intermediate variables, we synthesize the text reasoning process for each reasoning problems. Through this method, we can synthesize data that is difficult, scalable, effective, and comes with golden standard answers and high-quality reasoning processes. As a result, with our 540K synthesized dataset constructed solely from 2,360 algorithm problems, our approach \footnote{Code and data are publicly available atthis https URL} achieves significant improvements in multiple models for the datasets \textit{BBH$^{27}$}, \textit{LogicBench}, \textit{DROP}, \textit{AR-LSAT}, and \textit{GSM8K}, etc. outperforming a wide range of existing reasoning datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language model alignment leverage token-level supervisions to perform fine-grained preference optimization. However, existing token-level alignment methods either optimize on all available tokens, which can be noisy and inefficient, or perform selective training with complex and expensive key token selection strategies. In this work, we propose Selective Preference Optimization (SePO), a novel selective alignment strategy that centers on efficient key token selection. SePO proposes the first token selection method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which trains an oracle model to estimate a token-level reward function on the target data. This method applies to any existing alignment datasets with response-level annotations and enables cost-efficient token selection with small-scale oracle models and training data. The estimated reward function is then utilized to score all tokens within the target dataset, where only the key tokens are selected to supervise the target policy model with a reference model-free contrastive objective function. Extensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks show that SePO significantly outperforms competitive baseline methods by only optimizing 30% key tokens on the target dataset. SePO applications on weak-to-strong generalization show that weak oracle models effectively supervise strong policy models with up to 16.8x more parameters. SePO also effectively selects key tokens from out-of-distribution data to enhance strong policy models and alleviate the over-optimization problem.

  This paper investigates the faithfulness of multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents in a graphical user interface (GUI) environment, aiming to address the research question of whether multimodal GUI agents can be distracted by environmental context. A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.

  Classical Arabic represents a significant era that encompasses the golden age of Arab culture, philosophy, and scientific literature. With a broad consensus on the importance of translating these literatures to enrich knowledge dissemination across communities, the advent of large language models (LLMs) and translation systems offers promising tools to facilitate this goal. However, we have identified a scarcity of translation datasets in Classical Arabic, which are often limited in scope and topics, hindering the development of high-quality translation systems. In response, we present the ATHAR dataset, which comprises 66,000 high-quality classical Arabic to English translation samples that cover a wide array of topics including science, culture, and philosophy. Furthermore, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs under various settings, concluding that there is a need for such datasets in current systems. Our findings highlight how models can benefit from fine-tuning or incorporating this dataset into their pretraining pipelines. The dataset is publicly available on the HuggingFace Data Hub:this https URL.

  Persona agents, which are LLM agents conditioned to act according to an assigned persona, enable contextually rich and user aligned interactions across domains like education and healthcare. However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.

  We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model.

  The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.

  We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window, thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality, camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive experiments on diverse datasets.

  The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28 interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to support continued research in this field.

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

  The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably, Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

  _Chaolei Wang, Yang Luo, Jing Du, Siyu Chen, Yiping Chen, Ting Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene. Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks, thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features, particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects. Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

  High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

  Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine) face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs. Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets. We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet, CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF), semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust. As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  _Djamel Eddine Boukhari_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale, potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware understanding.

  A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However, those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

  Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD) frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1\% on MVTec AD).

  We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on, capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence, where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots, cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size, allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD, HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and generalizability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover, there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components: a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1 percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage points.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA, and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM, KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing, interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

  _Tianpei Zhang, Jufeng Zhao, Yiming Zhu, Guangmang Cui_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion), a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs) for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features. Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

  Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective, motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE = 10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

  We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision (CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry. However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios. Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear and tear detection scenarios

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases, Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing. To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world, outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher novel-view-synthesis quality.

  Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms. However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision, overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover, existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination, which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets. Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO (REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and models are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution (LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations. Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word and synthetic LF datasets.

  Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models, a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input. Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures, demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer, achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

  Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera, Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer), and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT, AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting. The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

  The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG, which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim 3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.

  This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category. MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael. MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads, performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping, emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic understanding for real-world decision-making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition, realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

  _Dharsan Ravindran, Kevin Wang, Zhuoyuan Cao, Saleh Abdelrahman, Jeffery Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging, where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases, we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts. We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets. Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance over existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the diverse vehicle platforms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs) have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing 62% fewer parameters. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models, they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods. Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective, generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection. Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches, DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data. A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at 512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification, automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as Skywork UniPic 2.0.

  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

  Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants, consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception. Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most (15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event. Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4 showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and highlighting areas for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities. However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC. Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research.

  Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations. First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records. Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few annotations are available for training, since the feature representation benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert annotations even if it is only available during training.

  Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE) module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons, that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models' tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its generality across various LVLMs.

  _Lydia Kin Ching Chau, Zhi Yu, Ruowei Jiang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore, current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making processes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to 58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction. However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage. However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in 3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

  _Mengyu Ren, Yutong Li, Hua Li, Runmin Cong, Sam Kwong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a long-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information, weak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex backgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A challenge in advancing Visual-Language Models (VLMs) is determining whether their failures on abstract reasoning tasks, such as Bongard problems, stem from flawed perception or faulty top-down reasoning. To disentangle these factors, we introduce a diagnostic framework centered on the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance achievable by a linear classifier on a VLM's raw visual embeddings. Applying this framework to state-of-the-art VLMs, we uncover a pervasive "alignment gap", where most models fail to generatively outperform the linear separability of their own representations. We find that the few models surpassing this ceiling do so via two mechanisms: by further refining visual representations into a more linearly separable format or by executing non-linear decision logic. We demonstrate that this bottleneck is not a fundamental limitation but a solvable alignment issue. By augmenting standard next-token prediction with a contrastive objective, our fine-tuning method activates dormant reasoning pathways, systematically improving the linear structure of representations to significantly surpass the LSC.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate surface estimation is critical for downstream tasks in scientific simulation, and quantifying uncertainty in implicit neural 3D representations still remains a substantial challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and geometric inconsistencies. However, current neural implicit surface models do not offer a principled way to quantify uncertainty, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Inspired by recent probabilistic rendering approaches, we introduce BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty estimation in neural implicit 3D representations. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) provide continuous, differentiable surface representations, making them especially well-suited for uncertainty-aware modeling. BayesSDF applies a Laplace approximation over SDF weights and derives Hessian-based metrics to estimate local geometric instability. We empirically demonstrate that these uncertainty estimates correlate strongly with surface reconstruction error across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. By enabling surface-aware uncertainty quantification, BayesSDF lays the groundwork for more robust, interpretable, and actionable 3D perception systems.

  As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework for generating 3D bridge data.This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance on the component completion task.This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Accurate histopathological grading of CRC is essential for prognosis and treatment planning but remains a subjective process prone to observer variability and limited by global shortages of trained pathologists. To promote automated and standardized solutions, we organized the ICIP Grand Challenge on Colorectal Cancer Tumor Grading and Segmentation using the publicly available METU CCTGS dataset. The dataset comprises 103 whole-slide images with expert pixel-level annotations for five tissue classes. Participants submitted segmentation masks via Codalab, evaluated using metrics such as macro F-score and mIoU. Among 39 participating teams, six outperformed the Swin Transformer baseline (62.92 F-score). This paper presents an overview of the challenge, dataset, and the top-performing methods

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and models of our YOLOv13 model are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions represented as two joints or first predict points before determining connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation properties.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

  The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment.

  Driverless train operation for open tracks on urban guided transport and mainline railways requires, among other things automatic detection of actual and potential obstacles, especially humans, in the danger zone of the train's path. Machine learning algorithms have proven to be powerful state-of-the-art tools for this task. However, these algorithms require large amounts of high-quality annotated data containing human beings in railway-specific environments as training data. Unfortunately, the amount of publicly available datasets is not yet sufficient and is significantly inferior to the datasets in the road domain. Therefore, this paper presents RailGoerl24, an on-board visual light Full HD camera dataset of 12205 frames recorded in a railway test center of T√úV S√úD Rail, in G√∂rlitz, Germany. Its main purpose is to support the development of driverless train operation for guided transport. RailGoerl24 also includes a terrestrial LiDAR scan covering parts of the area used to acquire the RGB data. In addition to the raw data, the dataset contains 33556 boxwise annotations in total for the object class 'person'. The faces of recorded actors are not blurred or altered in any other way.

  Preference alignment has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) following supervised fine-tuning. While existing preference alignment methods predominantly target hallucination factors, they overlook the factors essential for multi-modal comprehension capabilities, often narrowing their improvements on hallucination mitigation. To bridge this gap, we propose Instruction-oriented Preference Alignment (IPA), a scalable framework designed to automatically construct alignment preferences grounded in instruction fulfillment efficacy. Our method involves an automated preference construction coupled with a dedicated verification process that identifies instruction-oriented factors, avoiding significant variability in response representations. Additionally, IPA incorporates a progressive preference collection pipeline, further recalling challenging samples through model self-evolution and reference-guided refinement. Experiments conducted on Qwen2VL-7B demonstrate IPA's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks, including hallucination evaluation, visual question answering, and text understanding tasks, highlighting its capability to enhance general comprehension.

  Knowledge discovery and collection are intelligence-intensive tasks that traditionally require significant human effort to ensure high-quality outputs. Recent research has explored multi-agent frameworks for automating Wikipedia-style article generation by retrieving and synthesizing information from the internet. However, these methods primarily focus on text-only generation, overlooking the importance of multimodal content in enhancing informativeness and engagement. In this work, we introduce WikiAutoGen, a novel system for automated multimodal Wikipedia-style article generation. Unlike prior approaches, WikiAutoGen retrieves and integrates relevant images alongside text, enriching both the depth and visual appeal of generated content. To further improve factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective self-reflection mechanism, which critically assesses retrieved content from diverse viewpoints to enhance reliability, breadth, and coherence, etc. Additionally, we introduce WikiSeek, a benchmark comprising Wikipedia articles with topics paired with both textual and image-based representations, designed to evaluate multimodal knowledge generation on more challenging topics. Experimental results show that WikiAutoGen outperforms previous methods by 8%-29% on our WikiSeek benchmark, producing more accurate, coherent, and visually enriched Wikipedia-style articles.

  Multi-map Sparse Monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping applied to monocular endoscopic sequences has proven efficient to robustly recover tracking after the frequent losses in endoscopy due to motion blur, temporal occlusion, tools interaction or water jets. The sparse multi-maps are adequate for robust camera localization, however they are very poor for environment representation, they are noisy, with a high percentage of inaccurately reconstructed 3D points, including significant outliers, and more importantly with an unacceptable low density for clinical applications.We propose a method to remove outliers and densify the maps of the state of the art for sparse endoscopy multi-map CudaSIFT-SLAM. The NN LightDepth for up-to-scale depth dense predictions are aligned with the sparse CudaSIFT submaps by means of the robust to spurious LMedS. Our system mitigates the inherent scale ambiguity in monocular depth estimation while filtering outliers, leading to reliable densified 3D maps.We provide experimental evidence of accurate densified maps 4.15 mm RMS accuracy at affordable computing time in the C3VD phantom colon dataset. We report qualitative results on the real colonoscopy from the Endomapper dataset.

  We introduce ActiveGAMER, an active mapping system that utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to achieve high-quality, real-time scene mapping and exploration. Unlike traditional NeRF-based methods, which are computationally demanding and restrict active mapping performance, our approach leverages the efficient rendering capabilities of 3DGS, allowing effective and efficient exploration in complex environments. The core of our system is a rendering-based information gain module that dynamically identifies the most informative viewpoints for next-best-view planning, enhancing both geometric and photometric reconstruction accuracy. ActiveGAMER also integrates a carefully balanced framework, combining coarse-to-fine exploration, post-refinement, and a global-local keyframe selection strategy to maximize reconstruction completeness and fidelity. Our system autonomously explores and reconstructs environments with state-of-the-art geometric and photometric accuracy and completeness, significantly surpassing existing approaches in both aspects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clothed avatar generation has wide applications in virtual and augmented reality, filmmaking, and more. Previous methods have achieved success in generating diverse digital avatars, however, generating avatars with disentangled components (\eg, body, hair, and clothes) has long been a challenge. In this paper, we propose LayerAvatar, the first feed-forward diffusion-based method for generating component-disentangled clothed avatars. To achieve this, we first propose a layered UV feature plane representation, where components are distributed in different layers of the Gaussian-based UV feature plane with corresponding semantic labels. This representation supports high-resolution and real-time rendering, as well as expressive animation including controllable gestures and facial expressions. Based on the well-designed representation, we train a single-stage diffusion model and introduce constrain terms to address the severe occlusion problem of the innermost human body layer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performances of our method in generating disentangled clothed avatars, and we further explore its applications in component transfer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid growth usage of face recognition in people's daily life, face anti-spoofing becomes increasingly important to avoid malicious attacks. Recent face anti-spoofing models can reach a high classification accuracy on multiple datasets but these models can only tell people "this face is fake" while lacking the explanation to answer "why it is fake". Such a system undermines trustworthiness and causes user confusion, as it denies their requests without providing any explanations. In this paper, we incorporate XAI into face anti-spoofing and propose a new problem termed X-FAS (eXplainable Face Anti-Spoofing) empowering face anti-spoofing models to provide an explanation. We propose SPTD (SPoof Trace Discovery), an X-FAS method which can discover spoof concepts and provide reliable explanations on the basis of discovered concepts. To evaluate the quality of X-FAS methods, we propose an X-FAS benchmark with annotated spoof traces by experts. We analyze SPTD explanations on face anti-spoofing dataset and compare SPTD quantitatively and qualitatively with previous XAI methods on proposed X-FAS benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate SPTD's ability to generate reliable explanations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we introduce DirectorLLM, a novel video generation model that employs a large language model (LLM) to orchestrate human poses within videos. As foundational text-to-video models rapidly evolve, the demand for high-quality human motion and interaction grows. To address this need and enhance the authenticity of human motions, we extend the LLM from a text generator to a video director and human motion simulator. Utilizing open-source resources from Llama 3, we train the DirectorLLM to generate detailed instructional signals, such as human poses, to guide video generation. This approach offloads the simulation of human motion from the video generator to the LLM, effectively creating informative outlines for human-centric scenes. These signals are used as conditions by the video renderer, facilitating more realistic and prompt-following video generation. As an independent LLM module, it can be applied to different video renderers, including UNet and DiT, with minimal effort. Experiments on automatic evaluation benchmarks and human evaluations show that our model outperforms existing ones in generating videos with higher human motion fidelity, improved prompt faithfulness, and enhanced rendered subject naturalness.

  _Lingxiao Li, Kaixuan Fan, Boqing Gong, Xiangyu Yue_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot image generation aims to generate diverse and high-quality images for an unseen class given only a few examples in that class. A key challenge in this task is balancing category consistency and image diversity, which often compete with each other. Moreover, existing methods offer limited control over the attributes of newly generated images. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders (HypDAE), a novel approach that operates in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships among images from seen categories. By leveraging pre-trained foundation models, HypDAE generates diverse new images for unseen categories with exceptional quality by varying stochastic subcodes or semantic codes. Most importantly, the hyperbolic representation introduces an additional degree of control over semantic diversity through the adjustment of radii within the hyperbolic disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HypDAE significantly outperforms prior methods by achieving a better balance between preserving category-relevant features and promoting image diversity with limited data. Furthermore, HypDAE offers a highly controllable and interpretable generation process.

  _Hanwen Cao, George J. Pappas, Nikolay Atanasov_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we derive a new Kalman filter with probabilistic data association between measurements and states. We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating visual and textual inputs, yet modality alignment remains one of the most challenging aspects. Current MLLMs typically rely on simple adapter architectures and pretraining approaches to bridge vision encoders with large language models (LLM), guided by image-level supervision. We identify this paradigm often leads to suboptimal alignment between modalities, significantly constraining the LLM's ability to properly interpret and reason with visual features particularly for smaller language models. This limitation degrades overall performance-particularly for smaller language models where capacity constraints are more pronounced and adaptation capabilities are limited. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Supervised Embedding Alignment (SEA), a token-level supervision alignment method that enables more precise visual-text alignment during pretraining. SEA introduces minimal computational overhead while preserving language capabilities and substantially improving cross-modal understanding. Our comprehensive analyses reveal critical insights into the adapter's role in multimodal integration, and extensive experiments demonstrate that SEA consistently improves performance across various model sizes, with smaller models benefiting the most (average performance gain of 7.61% for Gemma-2B). This work establishes a foundation for developing more effective alignment strategies for future multimodal systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objects falling from buildings, a frequently occurring event in daily life, can cause severe injuries to pedestrians due to the high impact force they exert. Surveillance cameras are often installed around buildings to detect falling objects, but such detection remains challenging due to the small size and fast motion of the objects. Moreover, the field of falling object detection around buildings (FODB) lacks a large-scale dataset for training learning-based detection methods and for standardized evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a large and diverse video benchmark dataset named FADE. Specifically, FADE contains 2,611 videos from 25 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather conditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a novel detection method for FODB that effectively leverages motion information and generates small-sized yet high-quality detection proposals. The efficacy of our method is evaluated on the proposed FADE dataset by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches in generic object detection, video object detection, and moving object detection. The dataset and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the constraints on model performance imposed by the size of the training data, data augmentation has become an essential technique in deep learning. However, most existing data augmentation methods are affected by information loss and perform poorly in small-sample scenarios, which limits their application. To overcome the limitation, we propose a Feature Augmentation method on Geodesic Curve in the pre-shape space, called the FAGC. First, a pre-trained neural network model is employed to extract features from the input images. Then, the image features as a vector is projected into the pre-shape space by removing its position and scale information. In the pre-shape space, an optimal Geodesic curve is constructed to fit the feature vectors. Finally, new feature vectors are generated for model learning by interpolating along the constructed Geodesic curve. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the FAGC. The results demonstrate that applying the FAGC to deep learning or machine learning methods can significantly improve their performance in small-sample tasks.

  3D skeleton-based human action recognition has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional RGB and depth-based approaches, offering robustness to environmental variations, computational efficiency, and enhanced privacy. Despite remarkable progress, current research remains fragmented across diverse input representations and lacks evaluation under scenarios that reflect modern real-world challenges.This paper presents a representation-centric survey of skeleton-based action recognition, systematically categorizing state-of-the-art methods by their input feature types: joint coordinates, bone vectors, motion flows, and extended representations, and analyzing how these choices influence spatial-temporal modeling strategies.Building on the insights from this review, we introduce ANUBIS, a large-scale, challenging skeleton action dataset designed to address critical gaps in existing benchmarks. ANUBIS incorporates multi-view recordings with back-view perspectives, complex multi-person interactions, fine-grained and violent actions, and contemporary social behaviors.We benchmark a diverse set of state-of-the-art models on ANUBIS and conduct an in-depth analysis of how different feature types affect recognition performance across 102 action categories. Our results show strong action-feature dependencies, highlight the limitations of na√Øve multi-representational fusion, and point toward the need for task-aware, semantically aligned integration strategies. This work offers both a comprehensive foundation and a practical benchmarking resource, aiming to guide the next generation of robust, generalizable skeleton-based action recognition systems for complex real-world scenarios.The dataset website, benchmarking framework, and download link are available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the learned policy model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%, outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

  Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4 percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.

  We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally, we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage technologies.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II Poincar√© inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686. Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions. Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability, which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute kernels.We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200 articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and integrating foundational models with federated learning.

  We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy. Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally, factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a "delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case, while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

  The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small, since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of $3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem (OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

  Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks. For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting, our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving heterogeneous biomedical data.

  In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth information while some methods has considered the total network depth for better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2) the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class. Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

  This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments. The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity, graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud networks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence, improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and pretrained models will be released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space, offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a classifier.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load, attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes. The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31 subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of 93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

  The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts. The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions, open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other ontologies and multilingual titles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics, finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series, construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training. In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network (GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting. Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and (2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23 representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points. However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance; (2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning optimization.

  Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets, they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories, particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically, we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR} asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

  _Gongyue Zhang, Honghai Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation, fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency, which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs) provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g., road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1) Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a wide range of dynamical systems.

  _Difei Xu, Meng Ding, Zihang Xiang, Jinhui Xu, Di Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model (DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$, where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is $\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$ in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension, and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where$\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$. Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an upper bound of $\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$ even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated Differential Privacy is lower bounded by $\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

  _David Millard, Lars Lindemann, Ali Baheri_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

  Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with additional information about the electronic structure and interactions. Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed features and adaptive task weighting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning (RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support, risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings. Here, we present CEHR-XGPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, CEHR-XGPT incorporates a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-XGPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining.

  _Yaniv Hassidof, Tom Jurgenson, Kiril Solovey_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a provably-generalizable framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield provably-safe solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a single environment. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, DiTree achieves on average a 30% higher success rate compared to standalone DP or SBPs, on a dynamic car and Mujoco's ant robot settings (for the latter, SBPs fail completely). Beyond simulation, real-world car experiments confirm DiTree's applicability, demonstrating superior trajectory quality and robustness even under severe sim-to-real gaps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs, indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and na√Øve ensemble baselines. In addition, we explore using MUSE as guided signals with chain-of-thought distillation to fine-tune LLMs for calibration. MUSE is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine) participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation, assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines' gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of $\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique in even more complex RL settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective: To develop and evaluate a scalable methodology for harmonizing inconsistent units in large-scale clinical datasets, addressing a key barrier to data interoperability.Materials and Methods: We designed a novel unit harmonization system combining BM25, sentence embeddings, Bayesian optimization, and a bidirectional transformer based binary classifier for retrieving and matching laboratory test entries. The system was evaluated using the Optum Clinformatics Datamart dataset (7.5 billion entries). We implemented a multi-stage pipeline: filtering, identification, harmonization proposal generation, automated re-ranking, and manual validation. Performance was assessed using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and other standard information retrieval metrics.Results: Our hybrid retrieval approach combining BM25 and sentence embeddings (MRR: 0.8833) significantly outperformed both lexical-only (MRR: 0.7985) and embedding-only (MRR: 0.5277) approaches. The transformer-based reranker further improved performance (absolute MRR improvement: 0.10), bringing the final system MRR to 0.9833. The system achieved 83.39\% precision at rank 1 and 94.66\% recall at rank 5.Discussion: The hybrid architecture effectively leverages the complementary strengths of lexical and semantic approaches. The reranker addresses cases where initial retrieval components make errors due to complex semantic relationships in medical terminology.Conclusion: Our framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for unit harmonization in clinical datasets, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy. Once harmonized, data can be reused seamlessly in different analyses, ensuring consistency across healthcare systems and enabling more reliable multi-institutional studies and meta-analyses.

  We present ALF (Advertiser Large Foundation model), a multi-modal transformer architecture for understanding advertiser behavior and intent across text, image, video, and structured data modalities. Through contrastive learning and multi-task optimization, ALF creates unified advertiser representations that capture both content and behavioral patterns. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on critical tasks including fraud detection, policy violation identification, and advertiser similarity matching. In production deployment, ALF demonstrates significant real-world impact by delivering simultaneous gains in both precision and recall, for instance boosting recall by over 40 percentage points on one critical policy and increasing precision to 99.8% on another. The architecture's effectiveness stems from its novel combination of multi-modal transformations, inter-sample attention mechanism, spectrally normalized projections, and calibrated probabilistic outputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become very widespread and are used to solve a wide variety of tasks. To successfully handle these tasks, LLMs require longer training times and larger model sizes. This makes LLMs ideal candidates for pruning methods that reduce computational demands while maintaining performance. Previous methods require a retraining phase after pruning to maintain the original model's performance. However, state-of-the-art pruning methods, such as Wanda, prune the model without retraining, making the pruning process faster and more efficient. Building upon Wanda's work, this study provides a theoretical explanation of why the method is effective and leverages these insights to enhance the pruning process. Specifically, a theoretical analysis of the pruning problem reveals a common scenario in Machine Learning where Wanda is the optimal pruning method. Furthermore, this analysis is extended to cases where Wanda is no longer optimal, leading to the development of a new method, STADE, based on the standard deviation of the input. From a theoretical standpoint, STADE demonstrates better generality across different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on Llama and Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT) models validate these theoretical findings, showing that depending on the training conditions, Wanda's optimal performance varies as predicted by the theoretical framework. These insights contribute to a more robust understanding of pruning strategies and their practical implications. Code is available at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach in language model interpretability, offering unsupervised extraction of sparse features. For interpretability methods to succeed, they must identify abstract features across domains, and these features can often manifest differently in each context. We examine this through "answerability" - a model's ability to recognize answerable questions. We extensively evaluate SAE feature generalization across diverse, partly self-constructed answerability datasets for Gemma 2 SAEs. Our analysis reveals that residual stream probes outperform SAE features within domains, but generalization performance differs sharply. SAE features show inconsistent out-of-domain transfer, with performance varying from almost random to outperforming residual stream probes. Overall, this demonstrates the need for robust evaluation methods and quantitative approaches to predict feature generalization in SAE-based interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the main concerns while deploying machine learning models in real-world applications is fairness. Counterfactual fairness has emerged as an intuitive and natural definition of fairness. However, existing methodologies for enforcing counterfactual fairness seem to have two limitations: (i) generating counterfactual samples faithful to the underlying causal graph, and (ii) as we argue in this paper, existing regularizers are mere proxies and do not directly enforce the exact definition of counterfactual fairness. In this work, our aim is to mitigate both issues. Firstly, we propose employing Neural Causal Models (NCMs) for generating the counterfactual samples. For implementing the abduction step in NCMs, the posteriors of the exogenous variables need to be estimated given a counterfactual query, as they are not readily available. As a consequence, $\mathcal{L}_3$ consistency with respect to the underlying causal graph cannot be guaranteed in practice due to the estimation errors involved. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel kernel least squares loss term that enforces the $\mathcal{L}_3$ constraints explicitly. Thus, we obtain an improved counterfactual generation suitable for the counterfactual fairness task. Secondly, we propose a new MMD-based regularizer term that explicitly enforces the counterfactual fairness conditions into the base model while training. We show an improved trade-off between counterfactual fairness and generalization over existing baselines on synthetic and benchmark datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Constrained reinforcement learning (RL) seeks high-performance policies under safety constraints. We focus on an offline setting where the agent has only a fixed dataset -- common in realistic tasks to prevent unsafe exploration. To address this, we propose Diffusion-Regularized Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning (DRCORL), which first uses a diffusion model to capture the behavioral policy from offline data and then extracts a simplified policy to enable efficient inference. We further apply gradient manipulation for safety adaptation, balancing the reward objective and constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages high-quality offline data while incorporating safety requirements. Empirical results show that DRCORL achieves reliable safety performance, fast inference, and strong reward outcomes across robot learning tasks. Compared to existing safe offline RL methods, it consistently meets cost limits and performs well with the same hyperparameters, indicating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) knowledge with sequential decision-making tasks. However, few studies have thoroughly investigated the impact on LLM agents capabilities of fine-tuning them with RL in a specific environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to analyze the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt formulations following RL training in a textual environment. Our findings reveal that the performance of LLMs degrades when faced with prompt formulations different from those used during the RL training phase. Besides, we analyze the source of this sensitivity by examining the model's internal representations and salient tokens. Finally, we propose to use a contrastive loss to mitigate this sensitivity and improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of LLMs.

  _Adarsh Ganeshram, Haydn Maust, Valentin Duruisseaux, Zongyi Li, Yixuan Wang, Daniel Leibovici, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The physics-informed neural operator (PINO) is a machine learning paradigm that has demonstrated promising results for learning solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). It leverages the Fourier Neural Operator to learn solution operators in function spaces and leverages physics losses during training to penalize deviations from known physics laws. Spectral differentiation provides an efficient way to compute derivatives for the physics losses, but it inherently assumes periodicity. When applied to non-periodic functions, this assumption of periodicity can lead to significant errors, including Gibbs phenomena near domain boundaries which degrade the accuracy of both function representations and derivative computations, especially for higher order derivatives. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the FC-PINO (Fourier-Continuation-based PINO) architecture which extends the accuracy and efficiency of PINO and spectral differentiation to non-periodic and non-smooth PDEs. In FC-PINO, we propose integrating Fourier continuation into the PINO framework, and test two different continuation approaches: FC-Legendre and FC-Gram. By transforming non-periodic signals into periodic functions on extended domains in a well-conditioned manner, Fourier continuation enables fast and accurate derivative computations. This approach avoids the discretization sensitivity of finite differences and the memory overhead of automatic differentiation. We demonstrate that standard PINO struggles to solve non-periodic and non-smooth PDEs with high precision, across challenging benchmarks. In contrast, the proposed FC-PINO provides accurate, robust, and scalable solutions, substantially outperforming PINO alternatives, and demonstrating that Fourier continuation is critical for extending PINO to a wider range of PDE problems when high-precision solutions are needed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ubiquitous computing resources in 6G networks provide ideal environments for the fusion of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent services through the agent framework. With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled agents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment semantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual network devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled agents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient multi-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the LLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are proposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative collaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on edge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through task decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop utilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and replan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading strategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning capability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open challenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks, accelerating the advent of the 6G era.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment. Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics. Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical.

  Shared autonomy is a promising paradigm in robotic systems, particularly within the maritime domain, where complex, high-risk, and uncertain environments necessitate effective human-robot collaboration. This paper investigates the interaction of three complementary approaches to advance shared autonomy in heterogeneous marine robotic fleets: (i) the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate intuitive high-level task specification and support hull inspection missions, (ii) the implementation of human-in-the-loop interaction frameworks in multi-agent settings to enable adaptive and intent-aware coordination, and (iii) the development of a modular Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable and flexible mission control. Preliminary results from simulation and real-world lake-like environments demonstrate the potential of this multi-layered architecture to reduce operator cognitive load, enhance transparency, and improve adaptive behaviour alignment with human intent. Ongoing work focuses on fully integrating these components, refining coordination mechanisms, and validating the system in operational port scenarios. This study contributes to establishing a modular and scalable foundation for trustworthy, human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics applications.

  Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer (MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:this https URL.

  Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions: intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER. Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark. Demos, code and pretrained weights are available atthis https URL.

  Deep learning, with its exceptional learning capabilities and flexibility, has been widely applied in various applications. However, its black-box nature poses a significant challenge in real-time robotic applications, particularly in robot control, where trustworthiness and robustness are critical in ensuring safety. In robot motion control, it is essential to analyze and ensure system stability, necessitating the establishment of methodologies that address this need. This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for end-to-end deep learning control that can be integrated into existing robot control theories. The proposed control algorithm leverages a modular learning approach to update the weights of all layers in real time, ensuring system stability based on Lyapunov-like analysis. Experimental results on industrial robots are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed deep learning controller. The proposed method offers an effective solution to the black-box problem in deep learning, demonstrating the possibility of deploying real-time deep learning strategies for robot kinematic control in a stable manner. This achievement provides a critical foundation for future advancements in deep learning based real-time robotic applications.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from visual inputs, but generalizing these learned skills to new environments remains a major challenge in RL application, especially robotics. While data augmentation can improve generalization, it often compromises sample efficiency and training stability. This paper introduces DeGuV, an RL framework that enhances both generalization and sample efficiency. In specific, we leverage a learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive learning and stabilize Q-value estimation under augmentation to further enhance sample efficiency and training stability. We evaluate our proposed method on the RL-ViGen benchmark using the Franka Emika robot and demonstrate its effectiveness in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our results show that DeGuV outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample efficiency while also improving interpretability by highlighting the most relevant regions in the visual input

  _Byeong-Il Ham, Hyun-Bin Kim, Kyung-Soo Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a 3D path planning method that integrates the A* algorithm with the octree structure. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and legged robots have been extensively studied, enabling locomotion across a variety of terrains. Advances in mobility have enabled obstacles to be regarded not only as hindrances to be avoided, but also as navigational aids when beneficial. A modified 3D A* algorithm generates an optimal path by leveraging obstacles during the planning process. By incorporating a height-based penalty into the cost function, the algorithm enables the use of traversable obstacles to aid locomotion while avoiding those that are impassable, resulting in more efficient and realistic path generation. The octree-based 3D grid map achieves compression by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, especially in obstacle-free or sparsely populated areas. This reduces the number of nodes explored by the A* algorithm, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory usage, and supporting real-time path planning in practical environments. Benchmark results demonstrate that the use of octree structure ensures an optimal path while significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks. Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer routes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

  Continuous advancements in robotics and AI are driving the integration of robots from industry into everyday environments. However, dynamic and unpredictable human activities in daily lives would directly or indirectly conflict with robot actions. Besides, due to the social attributes of such human-induced conflicts, solutions are not always unique and depend highly on the user's personal preferences. To address these challenges and facilitate the development of household robots, we propose COMMET, a system for human-induced COnflicts in Mobile Manipulation of Everyday Tasks. COMMET employs a hybrid detection approach, which begins with multi-modal retrieval and escalates to fine-tuned model inference for low-confidence cases. Based on collected user preferred options and settings, GPT-4o will be used to summarize user preferences from relevant cases. In preliminary studies, our detection module shows better accuracy and latency compared with GPT models. To facilitate future research, we also design a user-friendly interface for user data collection and demonstrate an effective workflow for real-world deployments.

  In the field of robot learning, coordinating robot actions through language instructions is becoming increasingly feasible. However, adapting actions to human instructions remains challenging, as such instructions are often qualitative and require exploring behaviors that satisfy varying conditions. This paper proposes a motion generation model that adapts robot actions in response to modifier directives human instructions imposing behavioral conditions during task execution. The proposed method learns a mapping from modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks. Results show that it can adjust motions online in response to modifier directives, unlike conventional batch-based methods that cannot adapt during execution.

  As humanoid robots enter real-world environments, ensuring robust locomotion across diverse environments is crucial. This paper presents a computationally efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%, and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains, including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal surface material classification plays a critical role in advancing tactile perception for robotic manipulation and interaction. In this paper, we present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1 framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model, allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well, maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-horizon planning for robot manipulation is a challenging problem that requires reasoning about the effects of a sequence of actions on a physical 3D scene. While traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for long-horizon manipulation, they require discretizing the continuous state and action space into symbolic descriptions of objects, object relationships, and actions. Instead, we propose a hybrid learning-and-planning approach that leverages learned models as domain-specific priors to guide search in high-dimensional continuous action spaces. We introduce SPOT: Search over Point cloud Object Transformations, which plans by searching for a sequence of transformations from an initial scene point cloud to a goal-satisfying point cloud. SPOT samples candidate actions from learned suggesters that operate on partially observed point clouds, eliminating the need to discretize actions or object relationships. We evaluate SPOT on multi-object rearrangement tasks, reporting task planning success and task execution success in both simulation and real-world environments. Our experiments show that SPOT generates successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach. We also perform ablations that highlight the importance of search-based planning.

  We present an imitation learning approach for spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control(GNC) that achieves high performance from limited data. Using only 100 expert demonstrations, equivalent to 6,300 environment interactions, our method, which implements Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT), learns a control policy that maps visual and state observations to thrust and torque commands. ACT generates smoother, more consistent trajectories than a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) baseline trained with 40 million interactions. We evaluate ACT on a rendezvous task: in-orbit docking with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains. Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task horizon.

  Quadruped-based mobile manipulation presents significant challenges in robotics due to the diversity of required skills, the extended task horizon, and partial observability. After presenting a multi-stage pick-and-place task as a succinct yet sufficiently rich setup that captures key desiderata for quadruped-based mobile manipulation, we propose an approach that can train a visuo-motor policy entirely in simulation, and achieve nearly 80\% success in the real world. The policy efficiently performs search, approach, grasp, transport, and drop into actions, with emerged behaviors such as re-grasping and task chaining. We conduct an extensive set of real-world experiments with ablation studies highlighting key techniques for efficient training and effective sim-to-real transfer. Additional experiments demonstrate deployment across a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. Demo videos and additional resources are available on the project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Integrating generative AI such as Large Language Models into social robots has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and shaped by robot behavior: Participants responded well to polite, reasoned suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics between robots and human users.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

  This paper presents an MFG-based decision-making framework for autonomous driving in heterogeneous traffic. To capture diverse human behaviors, we propose a quantitative driving style representation that maps abstract traits to parameters such as speed, safety factors, and reaction time. These parameters are embedded into the MFG through a spatial influence field model. To ensure safe operation in dense traffic, we introduce a safety-critical lane-changing algorithm that leverages dynamic safety margins, time-to-collision analysis, and multi-layered constraints. Real-world NGSIM data is employed for style calibration and empirical validation. Experimental results demonstrate zero collisions across six style combinations, two 15-vehicle scenarios, and NGSIM-based trials, consistently outperforming conventional game-theoretic baselines. Overall, our approach provides a scalable, interpretable, and behavior-aware planning framework for real-world autonomous driving applications.

  Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene representations that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features. Current approaches typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction, failing to emulate the dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human cognition. We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase. Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance improvements across different representation paradigms. Through ablation studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive perception during manipulation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Navigating unknown environments to find a target object is a significant challenge. While semantic information is crucial for navigation, relying solely on it for decision-making may not always be efficient, especially in environments with weak semantic cues. Additionally, many methods are susceptible to misdetections, especially in environments with visually similar objects. To address these limitations, we propose ApexNav, a zero-shot object navigation framework that is both more efficient and reliable. For efficiency, ApexNav adaptively utilizes semantic information by analyzing its distribution in the environment, guiding exploration through semantic reasoning when cues are strong, and switching to geometry-based exploration when they are weak. For reliability, we propose a target-centric semantic fusion method that preserves long-term memory of the target and similar objects, enabling robust object identification even under noisy detections. We evaluate ApexNav on the HM3Dv1, HM3Dv2, and MP3D datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both SR and SPL metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each module. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the practicality of ApexNav in physical environments.

  Planning paths that maximize information gain for robotic platforms has wide-ranging applications and significant potential impact. To effectively adapt to real-time data collection, informative path planning must be computed online and be responsive to new observations. In this work, we present IA-TIGRIS, an incremental and adaptive sampling-based informative path planner designed for real-time onboard execution. Our approach leverages past planning efforts through incremental refinement while continuously adapting to updated belief maps. We additionally present detailed implementation and optimization insights to facilitate real-world deployment, along with an array of reward functions tailored to specific missions and behaviors. Extensive simulation results demonstrate IA-TIGRIS generates higher-quality paths compared to baseline methods. We validate our planner on two distinct hardware platforms: a hexarotor UAV and a fixed-wing UAV, each having different motion models and configuration spaces. Our results show up to a 41% improvement in information gain compared to baseline methods, highlighting the planner's potential for deployment in real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating object shaping by grinding with a robot is a crucial industrial process that involves removing material with a rotating grinding belt. This process generates removal resistance depending on such process conditions as material type, removal volume, and robot grinding posture, all of which complicate the analytical modeling of shape transitions. Additionally, a data-driven approach based on real-world data is challenging due to high data collection costs and the irreversible nature of the process. This paper proposes a Cutting Sequence Diffuser (CSD) for object shaping by grinding. The CSD, which only requires simple simulation data for model learning, offers an efficient way to plan long-horizon action sequences transferable to the real world. Our method designs a smooth action space with constrained small removal volumes to suppress the complexity of the shape transitions caused by removal resistance, thus reducing the reality gap in simulations. Moreover, by using a diffusion model to generate long-horizon action sequences, our approach reduces the planning time and allows for grinding the target shape while adhering to the constraints of a small removal volume per step. Through evaluations in both simulation and real robot experiments, we confirmed that our CSD was effective for grinding to different materials and various target shapes in a short time.

  We present an active mapping system that plans for both long-horizon exploration goals and short-term actions using a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Existing methods either do not take advantage of recent developments in multimodal Large Language Models (LLM) or do not consider challenges in localization uncertainty, which is critical in embodied agents. We propose employing multimodal LLMs for long-horizon planning in conjunction with detailed motion planning using our information-based objective. By leveraging high-quality view synthesis from our 3DGS representation, our method employs a multimodal LLM as a zero-shot planner for long-horizon exploration goals from the semantic perspective. We also introduce an uncertainty-aware path proposal and selection algorithm that balances the dual objectives of maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results of the proposed method.

  Control of legged robots is a challenging problem that has been investigated by different approaches, such as model-based control and learning algorithms. This work proposes a novel Imitating and Finetuning Model Predictive Control (IFM) framework to take the strengths of both approaches. Our framework first develops a conventional model predictive controller (MPC) using Differential Dynamic Programming and Raibert heuristic, which serves as an expert policy. Then we train a clone of the MPC using imitation learning to make the controller learnable. Finally, we leverage deep reinforcement learning with limited exploration for further finetuning the policy on more challenging terrains. By conducting comprehensive simulation and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed IFM framework can significantly improve the performance of the given MPC controller on rough, slippery, and conveyor terrains that require careful coordination of footsteps. We also showcase that IFM can efficiently produce more symmetric, periodic, and energy-efficient gaits compared to Vanilla RL with a minimal burden of reward shaping.

  We introduce a new graph neural operator-based approach for task allocation in a system of heterogeneous robots composed of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed model, \texttt{\method}, or \textbf{G}raph \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}llocato\textbf{R} aggregates information from neighbors in the multi-robot system, with the aim of achieving globally optimal target localization. Being decentralized, our method is highly robust and adaptable to situations where the number of robots and the number of tasks may change over time. We also propose a heterogeneity-aware preprocessing technique to model the heterogeneity of the system. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach in a range of simulated scenarios generated by varying the number of UGVs and UAVs and the number and location of the targets. We show that a single model can handle a heterogeneous robot team with a number of robots ranging between 2 and 12 while outperforming the baseline architectures.

  The previously introduced aerial manipulation systems suffer from either limited end-effector DOF or small payload capacity. In this dissertation, a quadrotor with a 2-DOF manipulator is investigated that has a unique topology to enable the end-effector to track 6-DOF trajectory with the minimum possible number of actuators/links and hence, maximize the payload and/or mission time. The proposed system is designed, modeled, and constructed. An identification process is carried out to find the system parameters. An experimental setup is proposed with a 6-DOF state measurement and estimation scheme. The system feasibility is validated via numerical and experimental results. The inverse kinematics require a solution of complicated algebraic-differential equations. Therefore, an algorithm is developed to get an approximate solution of these equations.
