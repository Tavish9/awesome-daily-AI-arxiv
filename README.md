- **[ConciseHint: Boosting Efficient Reasoning via Continuous Concise Hints during Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18810)**  `arXiv:2506.18810`  
  _Siao Tang, Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Xinchao Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

- **[TRIZ Agents: A Multi-Agent LLM Approach for TRIZ-Based Innovation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18783)**  `arXiv:2506.18783`  
  _Kamil Szczepanik, Jaros≈Çaw A. Chudziak_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured, knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

- **[Programming by Backprop: LLMs Acquire Reusable Algorithmic Abstractions During Code Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18777)**  `arXiv:2506.18777`  
  _Jonathan Cook, Silvia Sapora, Arash Ahmadian, Akbir Khan, Tim Rocktaschel, Jakob Foerster, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.

- **[Dual-level Behavioral Consistency for Inter-group and Intra-group Coordination in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18651)**  `arXiv:2506.18651`  
  _Shuocun Yang, Huawen Hu, Enze Shi, Shu Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups. Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation. Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems, and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic environments can be further explored in the future.

- **[AggTruth: Contextual Hallucination Detection using Aggregated Attention Scores in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18628)**  `arXiv:2506.18628`  
  _Piotr Matys, Jan Eliasz, Konrad Kie≈Çczy≈Ñski, Miko≈Çaj Langner, Teddy Ferdinan, Jan Koco≈Ñ, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context (passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to achieve optimal results.

- **[A Question Bank to Assess AI Inclusivity: Mapping out the Journey from Diversity Errors to Inclusion Excellence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18538)**  `arXiv:2506.18538`  
  _Rifat Ara Shams, Didar Zowghi, Muneera Bano_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring diversity and inclusion (D&I) in artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial for mitigating biases and promoting equitable decision-making. However, existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles. This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks, and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70 AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

- **[Standard Applicability Judgment and Cross-jurisdictional Reasoning: A RAG-based Framework for Medical Device Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18511)**  `arXiv:2506.18511`  
  _Yu Han, Aaron Ceross, Jeroen H.M. Bergmann_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory frameworks.

- **[How Robust is Model Editing after Fine-Tuning? An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18428)**  `arXiv:2506.18428`  
  _Feng He, Zhenyang Liu, Marco Valentino, Zhixue Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa, the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies, emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and alignment properties.

- **[Dynamic Knowledge Exchange and Dual-diversity Review: Concisely Unleashing the Potential of a Multi-Agent Research Team](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18348)**  `arXiv:2506.18348`  
  _Weilun Yu, Shixiang Tang, Yonggui Huang, Nanqing Dong, Li Fan, Honggang Qi, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain. Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics in LLM-based autonomous research.

  _FuTe Wong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces an advanced framework leveraging Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLMMA) for the automated search and optimization of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms. Inspired by Google DeepMind's FunSearch, the proposed system works on abstract level to iteratively generates and refines quantum transformations of classical machine learning algorithms (concepts), such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron, forward-forward and backpropagation algorithms. As a proof of concept, this work highlights the potential of agentic frameworks to systematically explore classical machine learning concepts and adapt them for quantum computing, paving the way for efficient and automated development of QML algorithms. Future directions include incorporating planning mechanisms and optimizing strategy in the search space for broader applications in quantum-enhanced machine learning.

- **[The 4th Dimension for Scaling Model Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18233)**  `arXiv:2506.18233`  
  _Ruike Zhu, Hanwen Zhang, Tianyu Shi, Chi Wang, Tianyi Zhou, Zengyi Qin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost constant, with only minor variations.VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability, provided the scaling method is properly implemented.The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase the parameter count to enhance reasoning.These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and transparent evaluations are becoming essential tools in AI governance, informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks. Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured, descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses, assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation landscapes.

- **[Reasoning about Uncertainty: Do Reasoning Models Know When They Don't Know?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18183)**  `arXiv:2506.18183`  
  _Zhiting Mei, Christina Zhang, Tenny Yin, Justin Lidard, Ola Shorinwa, Anirudha Majumdar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

- **[Chain-of-Memory: Enhancing GUI Agents for Cross-Application Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18158)**  `arXiv:2506.18158`  
  _Xinzge Gao, Chuanrui Hu, Bin Chen, Teng Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

- **[AI Through the Human Lens: Investigating Cognitive Theories in Machine Psychology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18156)**  `arXiv:2506.18156`  
  _Akash Kundu, Rishika Goswami_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency, ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI safety

- **[CoachGPT: A Scaffolding-based Academic Writing Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18149)**  `arXiv:2506.18149`  
  _Fumian Chen, Sotheara Veng, Joshua Wilson, Xiaoming Li, Hui Fang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings, subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic writing.

  _Zijun Chen, Zhanpeng Zhou, Bo Zhang, Weinan Zhang, Xi Sun, Junchi Yan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property: interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii) adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose \texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably, \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging techniques.

- **[Decentralized Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Constrained UAV Pursuit-Evasion Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18126)**  `arXiv:2506.18126`  
  _Xiang Yuming, Li Sizhao, Li Rongpeng, Zhao Zhifeng, Zhang Honggang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications, especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG, especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem, which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework (i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)), which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation. Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication (ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages. Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task completion capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents. These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks, including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies, and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is available at: {this https URL}.

  _Joseph Babb, Joohyung Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

  AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process. In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing, and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents. To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs. Related resources are collected and continuously updated for the community in the Github link.

  The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary (BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions, adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside directions for future enhancements.

  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible, struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while maintaining scalability for real-world applications.

  _Elija Perrier_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment, they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI systems.

  Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found atthis https URL

  Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2) Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while substantially reducing communication overhead.

  The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency. Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically, inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface. With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

  Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models, requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8 major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions, systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation, automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning. For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills, and multimodal understanding.

  Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities, from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs' performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback from the CTF environment.Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80% performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU, CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual) pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks. Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent. Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the original token count.

  Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover, they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup, an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic use-cases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however, critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows, and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy, inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base - reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses. By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency: reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction. However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent. OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency. Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3% on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

  AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge. Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently, but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing human social world.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect (ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves "imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts. Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual counterfactuals (non-actual).

  We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

  Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2) models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating formalized and fine-grained logical training.

  We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task, SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and (iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally, logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

  Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field. However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods. As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones, non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in Agentic AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating table extraction (TE) from business documents is critical for industrial workflows but remains challenging due to sparse annotations and error-prone multi-stage pipelines. While semi-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage unlabeled data, existing methods rely on confidence scores that poorly reflect extraction quality. We propose QUEST, a Quality-aware Semi-supervised Table extraction framework designed for business documents. QUEST introduces a novel quality assessment model that evaluates structural and contextual features of extracted tables, trained to predict F1 scores instead of relying on confidence metrics. This quality-aware approach guides pseudo-label selection during iterative SSL training, while diversity measures (DPP, Vendi score, IntDiv) mitigate confirmation bias. Experiments on a proprietary business dataset (1000 annotated + 10000 unannotated documents) show QUEST improves F1 from 64% to 74% and reduces empty predictions by 45% (from 12% to 6.5%). On the DocILE benchmark (600 annotated + 20000 unannotated documents), QUEST achieves a 50% F1 score (up from 42%) and reduces empty predictions by 19% (from 27% to 22%). The framework's interpretable quality assessments and robustness to annotation scarcity make it particularly suited for business documents, where structural consistency and data completeness are paramount.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large reasoning models have recently made significant strides in mathematical and code reasoning, yet their success has not transferred smoothly to the medical domain. While multiple factors contribute to this disparity, a critical issue is the inadequate focus on the quality of intermediate reflection steps, which is particularly crucial in high-stakes medical scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Med-REFL, a \underline{\textbf{Med}}ical \underline{\textbf{R}}easoning \underline{\textbf{E}}nhancement via self-corrected \underline{\textbf{F}}ine-grained ref\underline{\textbf{L}}ection. Our method leverages a tree-of-thought approach to decompose medical questions into fine-grained reasoning paths, quantitatively evaluating each step and its subsequent reflections. These assessments enable automatic construction of direct preference optimization data, reducing reliance on expensive expert annotations while guiding models to identify and correct reasoning errors. Experimental results on the MedQA-USMLE benchmark demonstrate Med-REFL achieves consistent improvements, with average gains up to 4.11\%. Notably, it further boosts the state-of-the-art performance of 7B/8B models by an additional 4.13\%. Furthermore, Med-REFL exhibits strong generalization capabilities and robustness across several challenging medical question-answering datasets. Our work illustrates that prioritizing reflection quality leads to more accurate and trustworthy reasoning in medical AI applications. Checkpoints, code, and data can be found inthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

  Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model, surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

  Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights, such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20 LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Zeyu Liu, Yuhang Liu, Guanghao Zhu, Congkai Xie, Zhen Li, Jianbo Yuan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase, Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts. The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated, caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on MathVista testmini).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs), current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency, or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an increase in accuracy on MedQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA ($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs. F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX (Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 45.2%).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Controllable code generation, the ability to synthesize code that follows a specified style while maintaining functionality, remains a challenging task. We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.

  _Longxi Gao, Li Zhang, Mengwei Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training effective Vision Language Models (VLMs) for GUI agents typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over large-scale annotated datasets, where the collection process is labor-intensive and error-prone. In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets, two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future. Code, model, and data are available at:this https URL

  Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.

  The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore the future landscape of agent protocols by identifying critical research directions and characteristics necessary for next-generation protocols. These characteristics include adaptability, privacy preservation, and group-based interaction, as well as trends toward layered architectures and collective intelligence infrastructures. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.

  Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications, from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance, including available resources and computational guidelines, to support real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems.

  LLMs have immense potential for generating plans, transforming an initial world state into a desired goal state. A large body of research has explored the use of LLMs for various planning tasks, from web navigation to travel planning and database querying. However, many of these systems are tailored to specific problems, making it challenging to compare them or determine the best approach for new tasks. There is also a lack of clear and consistent evaluation criteria. Our survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of current LLM planners to fill this gap. It builds on foundational work by Kartam and Wilkins (1990) and examines six key performance criteria: completeness, executability, optimality, representation, generalization, and efficiency. For each, we provide a thorough analysis of representative works and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Our paper also identifies crucial future directions, making it a valuable resource for both practitioners and newcomers interested in leveraging LLM planning to support agentic workflows.

  Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) involves discovering shared concepts across images through analogy, akin to solving IQ test problems. Bongard Problems (BPs) remain a key challenge in AVR, requiring both visual reasoning and verbal description. We investigate whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can solve BPs by formulating a set of diverse MLLM-suited solution strategies and testing $4$ proprietary and $4$ open-access models on $3$ BP datasets featuring synthetic (classic BPs) and real-world (Bongard HOI and Bongard-OpenWorld) images. Despite some successes on real-world datasets, MLLMs struggle with synthetic BPs. To explore this gap, we introduce Bongard-RWR, a dataset representing synthetic BP concepts using real-world images. Our findings suggest that weak MLLM performance on classical BPs is not due to the domain specificity, but rather comes from their general AVR limitations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant capability in vision-language understanding. However, one critical issue that persists in these models is sycophancy, where models are unduly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, resulting in biased outputs and hallucinations. Despite the rapid development of LVLMs, evaluating and mitigating sycophancy remains largely under-explored. In this work, we fill this gap by systematically analyzing sycophancy across multiple vision-language benchmarks and propose an inference-time mitigation framework. We curate leading queries and quantify the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LVLMs to prompt-induced bias, revealing consistent performance degradation and instability across models and tasks. Our analysis further uncovers model-specific behavioral traits, such as sentiment sensitivity and prediction polarity shifts under sycophancy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a training-free, model-agnostic framework that operates entirely at inference time. Our approach first employs a query neutralizer, leveraging an language model to suppress implicit sycophantic bias in user queries. We then introduce a sycophancy-aware contrastive decoding mechanism that dynamically recalibrates token-level output distributions by contrasting responses to neutralized and leading queries. Finally, an adaptive logits refinement module further modifies the contrasted logits by integrating both a adaptive plausibility filter and query sentiment scaler, ensuring coherent and robust generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework effectively mitigates sycophancy across all evaluated models, while maintaining performance on neutral prompts. Our results suggest that sycophancy in LVLMs is a general and urgent challenge, and that inference-time strategies offer a promising path toward trustworthy multimodal reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perturbation robustness evaluates the vulnerabilities of models, arising from a variety of perturbations, such as data corruptions and adversarial attacks. Understanding the mechanisms of perturbation robustness is critical for global interpretability. We present a model-agnostic, global mechanistic interpretability method to interpret the perturbation robustness of image models. This research is motivated by two key aspects. First, previous global interpretability works, in tandem with robustness benchmarks, e.g. mean corruption error (mCE), are not designed to directly interpret the mechanisms of perturbation robustness within image models. Second, we notice that the spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of perturbed natural images exponentially decay over the frequency. This power-law-like decay implies that: Low-frequency signals are generally more robust than high-frequency signals -- yet high classification accuracy can not be achieved by low-frequency signals alone. By applying Shapley value theory, our method axiomatically quantifies the predictive powers of robust features and non-robust features within an information theory framework. Our method, dubbed as \textbf{I-ASIDE} (\textbf{I}mage \textbf{A}xiomatic \textbf{S}pectral \textbf{I}mportance \textbf{D}ecomposition \textbf{E}xplanation), provides a unique insight into model robustness mechanisms. We conduct extensive experiments over a variety of vision models pre-trained on ImageNet to show that \textbf{I-ASIDE} can not only \textbf{measure} the perturbation robustness but also \textbf{provide interpretations} of its mechanisms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper shows the benefits and fruitfulness of evaluating LLMs with multiple problems at once, a paradigm we call multi-problem evaluation (MPE). Unlike conventional single-problem evaluation, where a prompt presents a single problem and expects one specific answer, MPE places multiple problems together in a single prompt and assesses how well an LLM answers all these problems in a single output. Leveraging 6 classification and 12 reasoning benchmarks that already exist, we introduce a new benchmark called ZeMPE (Zero-shot Multi-Problem Evaluation), comprising 53,100 zero-shot multi-problem prompts. We experiment with a total of 13 LLMs from 5 model families on ZeMPE to present a comprehensive and systematic MPE. Our results show that LLMs are capable of handling multiple problems from a single data source as well as handling them separately, but there are conditions this multiple problem handling capability falls short. In addition, we perform in-depth further analyses and explore model-level factors that may enable multiple problem handling capabilities in LLMs. We release our corpus and code to facilitate future research.

  Large-scale pre-trained models surpass in transferability and robust generalization across diverse datasets. The emergence of multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP has significantly boosted performance in various experiments. However, generalizing to new datasets or domains remains challenging, especially with limited labeled data. Also, existing methods often lack interpretability and impose high computational costs. To address this, we propose Robust Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (RPLKG), leveraging the knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompt sets automatically. Our method autonomously selects the optimal interpretable prompt based on dataset characteristics, achieving performance improvements over zero-shot learning and competitive performance compared to various prompt learning methods. Also, RPLKG efficiently reuses cached prompt embeddings from a single model pass and optimizes prompt selection via Gumbel-Softmax, enabling low-memory, fast training. Moreover, RPLKG advances few-shot learning effectiveness while enhancing interpretability and efficiency in model adaptation. Our

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI can not only outperform people in many planning tasks, but it can also teach them how to plan better. A recent and promising approach to improving human decision-making is to create intelligent tutors that utilize AI to discover and teach optimal planning strategies automatically. Prior work has shown that this approach can improve planning in artificial, fully observable planning tasks. Unlike these artificial tasks, many of the real-world situations in which people have to make plans include features that are only partially observable. To bridge this gap, we develop and evaluate the first intelligent tutor for planning in partially observable environments. Compared to previous intelligent tutors for teaching planning strategies, this novel intelligent tutor combines two innovations: 1) a new metareasoning algorithm for discovering optimal planning strategies for large, partially observable environments, and 2) scaffolding the learning process by having the learner choose from an increasing larger set of planning operations in increasingly larger planning problems. We found that our new strategy discovery algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art. A preregistered experiment with 330 participants demonstrated that the new intelligent tutor is highly effective at improving people's ability to make good decisions in partially observable environments. This suggests our intelligent cognitive tutor can successfully boost human planning in complex, partially observable sequential decision problems. That makes the work presented in this a promising step towards using AI-powered intelligent tutors to improve human planning in the real world.

  We introduce three concepts that describe an agent's incentives: response incentives indicate which variables in the environment, such as sensitive demographic information, affect the decision under the optimal policy. Instrumental control incentives indicate whether an agent's policy is chosen to manipulate part of its environment, such as the preferences or instructions of a user. Impact incentives indicate which variables an agent will affect, intentionally or otherwise. For each concept, we establish sound and complete graphical criteria, and discuss general classes of techniques that may be used to produce incentives for safe and fair agent behaviour. Finally, we outline how these notions may be generalised to multi-decision settings. This journal-length paper extends our conference publications "Incentives for Responsiveness, Instrumental Control and Impact" and "Agent Incentives: A Causal Perspective": the material on response incentives and instrumental control incentives is updated, while the work on impact incentives and multi-decision settings is entirely new.

  Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs). Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning, and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment. Projects:this https URL

  Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5% with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context length on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

  Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence, it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on ''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B, consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3-235B.

  _Aryasomayajula Ram Bharadwaj_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while significantly improving computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch. Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency, with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of 2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel data or specialized end-to-end training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence (RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al., 2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5 models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study summarization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency -- no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building more reliable and interpretable AI.

  Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements, indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework, a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support further research in automated judicial systems.

  Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND) pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks. We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to 89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards atthis https URLwhich are updated with new models and allow interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to influence education and help to address the global learning crisis. Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and policy decisions.

  _Christian Huber, Alexander Waibel_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g., byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to 11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original training corpus.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English. Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R√©nyi efficiency for 25 languages.

  This study examines how large language models understand the concept of persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features. Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper, we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time. Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies, transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system, additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated. Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors. Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I) corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''. Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt, which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that \texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover, ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through reinforcement learning.

  The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables, databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap, presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and the framework on [GitHub].

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for Arabic lemmatization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec, GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types: observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of \(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore, \(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency in LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and suitable for training MT or post-editing systems.

  Entity-aware machine translation (EAMT) is a complicated task in natural language processing due to not only the shortage of translation data related to the entities needed to translate but also the complexity in the context needed to process while translating those entities. In this paper, we propose a method that applies multi-task learning to optimize the performance of the two subtasks named entity recognition and machine translation, which improves the final performance of the Entity-aware machine translation task. The result and analysis are performed on the dataset provided by the organizer of Task 2 of the SemEval 2025 competition.

  This paper presents our system for the SMM4H-HeaRD 2025 shared tasks, specifically Task 4 (Subtasks 1, 2a, and 2b) and Task 5 (Subtasks 1 and 2). Task 4 focused on detecting mentions of insomnia in clinical notes, while Task 5 addressed the extraction of food safety events from news articles. We participated in all subtasks and report key findings across them, with particular emphasis on Task 5 Subtask 1, where our system achieved strong performance-securing first place with an F1 score of 0.958 on the test set. To attain this result, we employed encoder-based models (e.g., RoBERTa), alongside GPT-4 for data augmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the QuranMorph corpus, a morphologically annotated corpus for the Quran (77,429 tokens). Each token in the QuranMorph was manually lemmatized and tagged with its part-of-speech by three expert linguists. The lemmatization process utilized lemmas from Qabas, an Arabic lexicographic database linked with 110 lexicons and corpora of 2 million tokens. The part-of-speech tagging was performed using the fine-grained SAMA/Qabas tagset, which encompasses 40 tags. As shown in this paper, this rich lemmatization and POS tagset enabled the QuranMorph corpus to be inter-linked with many linguistic resources. The corpus is open-source and publicly available as part of the SinaLab resources at (this https URL)

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model manipulation.

  _Bugra Kilictas, Faruk Alpay_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations, causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural text generation systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry, the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers) obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks - multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1) Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2) Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95% accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40% top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper usage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks, such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics (fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that $\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding, especially in morphologically rich languages like Czech. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech text: prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning compact generative models. Using a dataset derived from the Prague Dependency Treebank, we evaluate several instruction-tuned LLMs, including Mistral Large 2 and Llama 3, using a series of prompt templates. We compare them against fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to 88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source corpora, highlighting key strengths and trade-offs of each approach.

  _Aziz Amari, Mohamed Achref Ben Ammar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently. Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle". To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic order of ideas.

  This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance information extraction from PDF files. Recognizing the richness and diversity of data within PDFs--including text, images, vector diagrams, graphs, and tables--poses unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual content. We seek to develop a comprehensive RAG-based QA system that will effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to processing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework to derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language models to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental evaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate information that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs. This work not only pushes the boundaries of retrieval-augmented QA systems but also lays a foundation for further research in multimodal data integration and processing.

  _Hong Su_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing generalization and reuse.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  _Chenghao Yang, Ari Holtzman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs) often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper, we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME process.

  Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites. However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic, template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates, achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC, demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains, human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles. In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved 89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement. Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and validating refinements before deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs) demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional, hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery, THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

  Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms (BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training. We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

  _Anwoy Chatterjee, Yash Goel, Tanmoy Chakraborty_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass, training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets, evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for efficient and practical hallucination detection.

  In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases (KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process. Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through \textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed reasoning trajectories...

  Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models (LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution, spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts, spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical languages.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

However, existing conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%, highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance detection.

  Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters, showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans), a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA). It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance, Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\% improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes usingthis http URLcode and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked, even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs.

  This paper presents Open Unified Speech Language Models (OpusLMs), a family of open foundational speech language models (SpeechLMs) up to 7B. Initialized from decoder-only text language models, the OpusLMs are continuously pre-trained on 213K hours of speech-text pairs and 292B text-only tokens. We demonstrate our OpusLMs achieve comparable (or even superior) performance with existing SpeechLMs in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text-only capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training strategies. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of model size scaling and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our code, data, checkpoints, and training logs to facilitate open SpeechLM research

  Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark, results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear path shifts and limited historical observations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text, including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources. However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources, AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V√°squez-Correa et al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al., 2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features, in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception using interpretable phonological features.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup, demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone, achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

  Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets - Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges, including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists, highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages. Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles, as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions. However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10 hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed (e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users' behalf.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident. Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide false answers to questions intended to verify theirthis http URLevaluate the potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind, and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM) outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These findings have significant implications for deploying language models in practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation are crucial.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

  Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven insights.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score. Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive medical question-answering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weight decay is a standard regularization technique for training large language models (LLMs). While it is common to assign a uniform decay rate to every layer, this approach overlooks the structural diversity of LLMs and the varying spectral properties across modules. In this paper, we introduce AlphaDecay, a simple yet effective method that adaptively assigns different weight decay strengths to each module of an LLM. Our approach is guided by Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) theory, which analyzes the empirical spectral density (ESD) of weight correlation matrices to quantify "heavy-tailedness." Modules exhibiting more pronounced heavy-tailed ESDs, reflecting stronger feature learning, are assigned weaker decay, while modules with lighter-tailed spectra receive stronger decay. Our method leverages tailored weight decay assignments to balance the module-wise differences in spectral properties, leading to improved performance. Extensive pre-training tasks with various model sizes from 60M to 1B demonstrate that AlphaDecay achieves better perplexity and generalization than conventional uniform decay and other adaptive decay baselines.

  Large Language Diffusion Models, or diffusion LLMs, have emerged as a significant focus in NLP research, with substantial effort directed toward understanding their scalability and downstream task performance. However, their long-context capabilities remain unexplored, lacking systematic analysis or methods for context extension. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation comparing the long-context performance of diffusion LLMs and traditional auto-regressive LLMs. We first identify a unique characteristic of diffusion LLMs, unlike auto-regressive LLMs, they maintain remarkably stable perplexity during direct context extrapolation. Moreover, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct local perception phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments. We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short. Consequently, this study establishes the first length extrapolation method for diffusion LLMs while providing essential theoretical insights and empirical benchmarks critical for advancing future research on long-context diffusion LLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday applications. As their influence grows, understanding their decision making and underlying personality becomes essential. In this work, we interpret model personality using our proposed Supernova Event Dataset, a novel dataset with diverse articles spanning biographies, historical events, news, and scientific discoveries. We use this dataset to benchmark LLMs on extracting and ranking key events from text, a subjective and complex challenge that requires reasoning over long-range context and modeling causal chains. We evaluate small models like Phi-4, Orca 2, and Qwen 2.5, and large, stronger models such as Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and OpenAI o3, and propose a framework where another LLM acts as a judge to infer each model's personality based on its selection and classification of events. Our analysis shows distinct personality traits: for instance, Orca 2 demonstrates emotional reasoning focusing on interpersonal dynamics, while Qwen 2.5 displays a more strategic, analytical style. When analyzing scientific discovery events, Claude Sonnet 3.7 emphasizes conceptual framing, Gemini 2.5 Pro prioritizes empirical validation, and o3 favors step-by-step causal reasoning. This analysis improves model interpretability, making them user-friendly for a wide range of diverse applications. Project Page -this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic textual data for training smaller specialized models. However, a comparison of various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking. While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations, label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data. Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods, particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings, characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories. Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods struggle.

  This report presents a unified instruction-based framework for learning generalized text embeddings optimized for both information retrieval (IR) and non-IR tasks. Built upon a decoder-only large language model (Mistral-7B), our approach combines in-context learning, soft supervision, and adaptive hard-negative mining to generate context-aware embeddings without task-specific fine-tuning. Structured instructions and few-shot examples are used to guide the model across diverse tasks, enabling strong performance on classification, semantic similarity, clustering, and reranking benchmarks. To improve semantic discrimination, we employ a soft labeling framework where continuous relevance scores, distilled from a high-performance dense retriever and reranker, serve as fine-grained supervision signals. In addition, we introduce adaptive margin-based hard-negative mining, which filters out semantically ambiguous negatives based on their similarity to positive examples, thereby enhancing training stability and retrieval robustness. Our model is evaluated on the newly introduced MTEB (English, v2) benchmark, covering 41 tasks across seven categories. Results show that our method achieves strong generalization and ranks among the top-performing models by Borda score, outperforming several larger or fully fine-tuned baselines. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining in-context prompting, soft supervision, and adaptive sampling for scalable, high-quality embedding generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long document classification poses challenges due to the computational limitations of transformer-based models, particularly BERT, which are constrained by fixed input lengths and quadratic attention complexity. Moreover, using the full document for classification is often redundant, as only a subset of sentences typically carries the necessary information. To address this, we propose a TF-IDF-based sentence ranking method that improves efficiency by selecting the most informative content. Our approach explores fixed-count and percentage-based sentence selection, along with an enhanced scoring strategy combining normalized TF-IDF scores and sentence length. Evaluated on the MahaNews LDC dataset of long Marathi news articles, the method consistently outperforms baselines such as first, last, and random sentence selection. With MahaBERT-v2, we achieve near-identical classification accuracy with just a 0.33 percent drop compared to the full-context baseline, while reducing input size by over 50 percent and inference latency by 43 percent. This demonstrates that significant context reduction is possible without sacrificing performance, making the method practical for real-world long document classification tasks.

  Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to answer questions that span tens of thousands of tokens, especially when multi-hop reasoning is involved. While prior benchmarks explore long-context comprehension or multi-hop reasoning in isolation, none jointly vary context length and reasoning depth in natural narrative settings. We introduce NovelHopQA, the first benchmark to evaluate 1-4 hop QA over 64k-128k-token excerpts from 83 full-length public-domain novels. A keyword-guided pipeline builds hop-separated chains grounded in coherent storylines. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art models and apply oracle-context filtering to ensure all questions are genuinely answerable. Human annotators validate both alignment and hop depth. We additionally present retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) evaluations to test model performance when only selected passages are provided instead of the full context. We noticed consistent accuracy drops with increased hops and context length increase, even for frontier models-revealing that sheer scale does not guarantee robust reasoning. Failure-mode analysis highlights common breakdowns such as missed final-hop integration and long-range drift. NovelHopQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting to test multi-hop reasoning at scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing 11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric. Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2) models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are extremely high.

  We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming, side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100 manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B) evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

  Mainstream large vision-language models (LVLMs) inherently encode cultural biases, highlighting the need for diverse multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce Pearl, a large-scale Arabic multimodal dataset and benchmark explicitly designed for cultural understanding. Constructed through advanced agentic workflows and extensive human-in-the-loop annotations by 45 annotators from across the Arab world, Pearl comprises over K multimodal examples spanning ten culturally significant domains covering all Arab countries. We further provide two robust evaluation benchmarks Pearl and Pearl-Lite along with a specialized subset Pearl-X explicitly developed to assess nuanced cultural variations. Comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art open and proprietary LVLMs demonstrate that reasoning-centric instruction alignment substantially improves models' cultural grounding compared to conventional scaling methods. Pearl establishes a foundational resource for advancing culturally-informed multimodal modeling research. All datasets and benchmarks are publicly available.

  Humans ponder before articulating complex sentence elements, enabling deeper cognitive processing through focused effort. In this work, we introduce this pondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward process within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of generating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model ponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the predicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input for another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this way through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Experiments across three widely used open-source architectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For language modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance comparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters. On 9 downstream benchmarks, our pondering-enhanced Pythia models significantly outperform the official Pythia models. Notably, PonderingPythia-2.8B surpasses Pythia-6.9B, and PonderingPythia-1B is comparable to TinyLlama-1.1B, which is trained on 10 times more data. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), motivating a growing body of work on prompt optimization. Most existing methods optimize prompts over a fixed dataset, assuming static input distributions and offering limited support for iterative improvement. We introduce SIPDO (Self-Improving Prompts through Data-Augmented Optimization), a closed-loop framework for prompt learning that integrates synthetic data generation into the optimization process. SIPDO couples a synthetic data generator with a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that reveal current prompt weaknesses and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. This feedback-driven loop enables systematic improvement of prompt performance without assuming access to external supervision or new tasks. Experiments across question answering and reasoning benchmarks show that SIPDO outperforms standard prompt tuning methods, highlighting the value of integrating data synthesis into prompt learning workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vector representations of contextual embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in various downstream tasks in numerical domains such as time series forecasting. Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black box behind the LLM and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numerical downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, a log-linear model for LLMs is considered in which numerical data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). For this model, it is demonstrated that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, it is shown how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numerical data and model architectures have different impacts on isotropy, and this variability directly affects the performances.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

  In the age of social media, the rapid spread of misinformation and rumors has led to the emergence of infodemics, where false information poses a significant threat to society. To combat this issue, we introduce TrumorGPT, a novel generative artificial intelligence solution designed for fact-checking in the health domain. TrumorGPT aims to distinguish "trumors", which are health-related rumors that turn out to be true, providing a crucial tool in differentiating between mere speculation and verified facts. This framework leverages a large language model (LLM) with few-shot learning for semantic health knowledge graph construction and semantic reasoning. TrumorGPT incorporates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) to address the hallucination issue common in LLMs and the limitations of static training data. GraphRAG involves accessing and utilizing information from regularly updated semantic health knowledge graphs that consist of the latest medical news and health information, ensuring that fact-checking by TrumorGPT is based on the most recent data. Evaluating with extensive healthcare datasets, TrumorGPT demonstrates superior performance in fact-checking for public health claims. Its ability to effectively conduct fact-checking across various platforms marks a critical step forward in the fight against health-related misinformation, enhancing trust and accuracy in the digital information age.

  Proper nouns in Arabic Wikipedia are frequently undiacritized, creating ambiguity in pronunciation and interpretation, especially for transliterated named entities of foreign origin. While transliteration and diacritization have been well-studied separately in Arabic NLP, their intersection remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new manually diacritized dataset of Arabic proper nouns of various origins with their English Wikipedia equivalent glosses, and present the challenges and guidelines we followed to create it. We benchmark GPT-4o on the task of recovering full diacritization given the undiacritized Arabic and English forms, and analyze its performance. Achieving 73% accuracy, our results underscore both the difficulty of the task and the need for improved models and resources. We release our dataset to facilitate further research on Arabic Wikipedia proper noun diacritization.

  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. These human-agent collaboration systems enable humans and LLM-based agents to collaborate effectively by leveraging their complementary strengths. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities arising from human-AI collaboration. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of simulating human behavior, offering cost-effective ways to estimate user responses to various surveys and polls. However, the questions in these surveys usually reflect socially understood attitudes: the patterns of attitudes of old/young, liberal/conservative, as understood by both members and non-members of those groups. It is not clear whether the LLM binding is \emph{deep}, meaning the LLM answers as a member of a particular in-group would, or \emph{shallow}, meaning the LLM responds as an out-group member believes an in-group member would. To explore this difference, we use questions that expose known in-group/out-group biases. This level of fidelity is critical for applying LLMs to various political science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics, inter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding. To this end, we propose a novel methodology for constructing virtual personas with synthetic user ``backstories" generated as extended, multi-turn interview transcripts. Our generated backstories are longer, rich in detail, and consistent in authentically describing a singular individual, compared to previous methods. We show that virtual personas conditioned on our backstories closely replicate human response distributions (up to an 87\% improvement as measured by Wasserstein Distance) and produce effect sizes that closely match those observed in the original studies of in-group/out-group biases. Altogether, our work extends the applicability of LLMs beyond estimating socially understood responses, enabling their use in a broader range of human studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In alignment scenarios such as safety, confidence, and general preference alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but essential for transferring human preference. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function choice for LLM alignment. Similarity reward circumvents binary preference data collection and reward modeling when unary high-quality reference answers are available. We introduce \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm that does not rely on reference or reward models. RefAlign utilizes similarity metrics, such as BERTScore between sampled generations and reference answers as surrogate rewards. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, RefAlign demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods without binary preference data and reward models.

  Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have significantly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks. However, existing RAG methods do not adequately utilize the naturally inherent hierarchical knowledge in human cognition, which limits the capabilities of RAG systems. In this paper, we introduce a new RAG approach, called HiRAG, which utilizes hierarchical knowledge to enhance the semantic understanding and structure capturing capabilities of RAG systems in the indexing and retrieval processes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HiRAG achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

  As Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, faithfully integrating evolving factual knowledge into these models remains a critical challenge. Continued pre-training on paraphrased data has shown empirical promise for enhancing knowledge acquisition. However, this approach is often costly and unreliable, as it relies on external models or manual effort for rewriting, and may inadvertently alter the factual content. In this work, we hypothesize and empirically show that an LLM's ability to continually predict the same factual knowledge tokens given diverse paraphrased contexts is positively correlated with its capacity to extract that knowledge via question-answering. Based on this view and aiming to improve generalization to diverse paraphrased contexts, we introduce two strategies to enhance LLMs' ability to predict the same knowledge tokens given varied contexts, thereby enhancing knowledge acquisition. First, we propose formatting-based data augmentation, which diversifies documents conveying the same knowledge by altering document formats rather than their content, thereby preserving factual integrity. Second, we adopt sharpness-aware minimization as the optimizer to better improve generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate our methods' effectiveness in both continued pre-training and instruction tuning, and further gains can be achieved by combining with paraphrased data.

  The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both RAG and long-context LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups for long-context inference. Our analyses also reveal the robustness of RAPID across various context lengths and retrieval quality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LMs' alignment with human reading behavior (i.e. psychometric predictive power; PPP) is known to improve during pretraining up to a tipping point, beyond which it either plateaus or degrades. Various factors, such as word frequency, recency bias in attention, and context size, have been theorized to affect PPP, yet there is no current account that explains why such a tipping point exists, and how it interacts with LMs' pretraining dynamics more generally. We hypothesize that the underlying factor is a pretraining phase transition, characterized by the rapid emergence of specialized attention heads. We conduct a series of correlational and causal experiments to show that such a phase transition is responsible for the tipping point in PPP. We then show that, rather than producing attention patterns that contribute to the degradation in PPP, phase transitions alter the subsequent learning dynamics of the model, such that further training keeps damaging PPP.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have improved factuality by grounding outputs in external evidence. However, they remain susceptible to unfaithful generation, where outputs contradict retrieved context despite its relevance and accuracy. Existing approaches aiming to improve faithfulness primarily focus on enhancing the utilization of external context, but often overlook the persistent influence of internal parametric knowledge during generation. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind unfaithful generation and identify a subset of mid-to-deep feed-forward networks (FFNs) that are disproportionately activated in such cases. Building on this insight, we propose Parametric Knowledge Muting through FFN Suppression (ParamMute), a framework that improves contextual faithfulness by suppressing the activation of unfaithfulness-associated FFNs and calibrating the model toward retrieved knowledge. To evaluate our approach, we introduce CoFaithfulQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate faithfulness in scenarios where internal knowledge conflicts with accurate external evidence. Experimental results show that ParamMute significantly enhances faithfulness across both CoFaithfulQA and the established ConFiQA benchmark, achieving substantial reductions in reliance on parametric memory. These findings underscore the importance of mitigating internal knowledge dominance and provide a new direction for improving LLM trustworthiness in RAG. All codes are available atthis https URL.

  The integration of additional modalities increases the susceptibility of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to safety risks, such as jailbreak attacks, compared to their language-only counterparts. While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats.

  Web crawl is a main source of large language models' (LLMs) pretraining data, but the majority of crawled web pages are discarded in pretraining due to low data quality. This paper presents Craw4LLM, an efficient web crawling method that explores the web graph based on the preference of LLM pretraining. Specifically, it leverages the influence of a webpage in LLM pretraining as the priority score of the web crawler's scheduler, replacing the standard graph connectivity based priority. Our experiments on a web graph containing 900 million webpages from a commercial search engine's index demonstrate the efficiency of Craw4LLM in obtaining high-quality pretraining data. With just 21% URLs crawled, LLMs pretrained on Craw4LLM data reach the same downstream performances of previous crawls, significantly reducing the crawling waste and alleviating the burdens on websites.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.

  Multi-agent debate (MAD) has gained significant attention as a promising line of research to improve the factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite its conceptual appeal, current MAD research suffers from critical limitations in evaluation practices, including limited benchmark coverage, weak baseline comparisons, and inconsistent setups. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of 5 representative MAD methods across 9 benchmarks using 4 foundational models. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that MAD often fail to outperform simple single-agent baselines such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, even when consuming significantly more inference-time computation. To advance MAD research, we further explore the role of model heterogeneity and find it as a universal antidote to consistently improve current MAD frameworks. Based on our findings, we argue that the field must stop overvaluing MAD in its current form; for true advancement, we must critically rethink evaluation paradigms and actively embrace model heterogeneity as a core design principle.

  While many advanced LLMs are designed to handle long sequence data, we can still observe notable quality degradation even within the sequence limit. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Scaling to Emphasize Attention for Long-context retrieval (SEAL), which enhances the retrieval performance of large language models (LLMs) over long contexts. We observe that specific attention heads are closely tied to long-context retrieval, showing positive or negative correlation with retrieval scores, and adjusting the strength of these heads boosts the quality of LLMs in long context by a large margin. Built on this insight, we propose a learning-based mechanism that leverages generated data to emphasize these heads. By applying SEAL, we achieve significant improvements in long-context retrieval performance across various tasks and models. Additionally, when combined with existing training-free context extension techniques, SEAL extends the contextual limits of LLMs while maintaining highly reliable outputs.

  The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education requires scalable and efficient frameworks that balance performance, adaptability, and cost. This paper addresses these needs by proposing a shared backbone model architecture enhanced with lightweight LoRA adapters for task-specific fine-tuning, targeting the automated scoring of student responses across 27 mutually exclusive tasks. By achieving competitive performance (average QWK of 0.848 compared to 0.888 for fully fine-tuned models) while reducing GPU memory consumption by 60% and inference latency by 40%, the framework demonstrates significant efficiency gains. This approach aligns with the workshop's focus on improving language models for educational tasks, creating responsible innovations for cost-sensitive deployment, and supporting educators by streamlining assessment workflows. The findings underscore the potential of scalable AI to enhance learning outcomes while maintaining fairness and transparency in automated scoring systems.

  Building safe Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages is essential in ensuring both safe access and linguistic diversity. To this end, we conduct a large-scale, comprehensive safety evaluation of the current LLM landscape. For this purpose, we introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, with category-wise annotations. Our extensive experiments on 39 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar inconsistencies can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure responsible usage across diverse communities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating the performance of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) models has become increasingly challenging, as large language model (LLM)-based GEC systems often produce corrections that diverge from provided gold references. This discrepancy undermines the reliability of traditional reference-based evaluation metrics. In this study, we propose a novel evaluation framework for GEC models, DSGram, integrating Semantic Coherence, Edit Level, and Fluency, and utilizing a dynamic weighting mechanism. Our framework employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in conjunction with large language models to ascertain the relative importance of various evaluation criteria. Additionally, we develop a dataset incorporating human annotations and LLM-simulated sentences to validate our algorithms and fine-tune more cost-effective models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach enhances the effectiveness of GEC model evaluations.

  The success of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in mitigating hallucinations in Vision Language Models (VLMs) critically hinges on the true reward gaps within preference pairs. However, current methods, typically relying on ranking or rewriting strategies, often struggle to optimize these reward gaps in a systematic way during data curation. A core difficulty lies in precisely characterizing and strategically manipulating the overall reward gap configuration, that is, the deliberate design of how to shape these reward gaps within each preference pair across the data. To address this, we introduce Topic-level Preference Rewriting(TPR), a novel framework designed for the systematic optimization of reward gap configuration. Through selectively replacing semantic topics within VLM responses with model's own resampled candidates for targeted rewriting, TPR can provide topic-level control over fine-grained semantic details. This precise control enables advanced data curation strategies, such as progressively adjusting the difficulty of rejected responses, thereby sculpting an effective reward gap configuration that guides the model to overcome challenging hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate TPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple hallucination benchmarks, outperforming previous methods by an average of 20%. Notably, it significantly reduces hallucinations by up to 93% on ObjectHal-Bench, and also exhibits superior data efficiency towards robust and cost-effective VLM alignment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated evaluation leveraging large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM evaluators or LLM-as-a-judge, has been widely used in measuring the performance of dialogue systems. However, the self-preference bias in LLMs has posed significant risks, including promoting specific styles or policies intrinsic to the LLMs. Despite the importance of this issue, there is a lack of established methods to measure the self-preference bias quantitatively, and its underlying causes are poorly understood. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantitative metric to measure the self-preference bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that GPT-4 exhibits a significant degree of self-preference bias. To explore the causes, we hypothesize that LLMs may favor outputs that are more familiar to them, as indicated by lower perplexity. We analyze the relationship between LLM evaluations and the perplexities of outputs. Our findings reveal that LLMs assign significantly higher evaluations to outputs with lower perplexity than human evaluators, regardless of whether the outputs were self-generated. This suggests that the essence of the bias lies in perplexity and that the self-preference bias exists because LLMs prefer texts more familiar to them.

  The paradigm of retrieval-augmented generated (RAG) helps mitigate hallucinations of large language models (LLMs). However, RAG also introduces biases contained within the retrieved documents. These biases can be amplified in scenarios which are multilingual and culturally-sensitive, such as territorial disputes. We thus introduce BordIRLines, a dataset of territorial disputes paired with retrieved Wikipedia documents, across 49 languages. We evaluate the cross-lingual robustness of this RAG setting by formalizing several modes for multilingual retrieval. Our experiments on several LLMs show that incorporating perspectives from diverse languages can in fact improve robustness; retrieving multilingual documents best improves response consistency and decreases geopolitical bias over RAG with purely in-language documents. We also consider how RAG responses utilize presented documents, finding a much wider variance in the linguistic distribution of response citations, when querying in low-resource languages. Our further analyses investigate the various aspects of a cross-lingual RAG pipeline, from retrieval to document contents. We release our benchmark and code to support continued research towards equitable information access across languages atthis https URL.

  Automatic disease diagnosis has become increasingly valuable in clinical practice. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, with growing evidence supporting the efficacy of LLMs in diagnostic tasks. Despite the increasing attention in this field, a holistic view is still lacking. Many critical aspects remain unclear, such as the diseases and clinical data to which LLMs have been applied, the LLM techniques employed, and the evaluation methods used. In this article, we perform a comprehensive review of LLM-based methods for disease diagnosis. Our review examines the existing literature across various dimensions, including disease types and associated clinical specialties, clinical data, LLM techniques, and evaluation methods. Additionally, we offer recommendations for applying and evaluating LLMs for diagnostic tasks. Furthermore, we assess the limitations of current research and discuss future directions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review for LLM-based disease diagnosis.

  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks requires substantial computational resources. Selective PEFT, a class of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies, aims to mitigate these computational challenges by selectively fine-tuning only a small fraction of the model parameters. Although parameter-efficient, these techniques often fail to match the performance of fully fine-tuned models, primarily due to inherent biases introduced during parameter selection. Traditional selective PEFT techniques use a fixed set of parameters selected using different importance heuristics, failing to capture parameter importance dynamically and often leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce $\text{ID}^3$, a novel selective PEFT method that calculates parameter importance continually, and dynamically unmasks parameters by balancing exploration and exploitation in parameter selection. Our empirical study on 16 tasks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning and summarization demonstrates the effectiveness of our method compared to fixed-masking selective PEFT techniques. We analytically show that $\text{ID}^3$ reduces the number of gradient updates by a factor of two, enhancing computational efficiency. Since $\text{ID}^3$ is robust to random initialization of neurons and operates directly on the optimization process, it is highly flexible and can be integrated with existing additive and reparametrization-based PEFT techniques such as adapters and LoRA respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on reasoning in language models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether they can learn systematic inferential principles or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. To understand and uncover the mechanisms adopted for formal reasoning in LMs, this paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic inference. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at interpreting content-independent and formal reasoning mechanisms. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic inference, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes, model sizes and architectures. The identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for syllogistic schemes on which the models achieve high accuracy (>60%), with compatible activation patterns across models of different families. Overall, our findings suggest that LMs learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalizable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.

  The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks has driven the research community to extend their capabilities to molecular applications. However, most molecular LLMs employ adapter-based architectures that do not treat molecule and text modalities equally and lack a supervision signal for the molecule modality. To address these issues, we introduce UniMoT, a Unified Molecule-Text LLM adopting a tokenizer-based architecture that expands the vocabulary of LLM with molecule tokens. Specifically, we introduce a Vector Quantization-driven tokenizer that incorporates a Q-Former to bridge the modality gap between molecule and text. This tokenizer transforms molecules into sequences of molecule tokens with causal dependency, encapsulating high-level molecular and textual information. Equipped with this tokenizer, UniMoT can unify molecule and text modalities under a shared token representation and an autoregressive training paradigm, enabling it to interpret molecules as a foreign language and generate them as text. Following a four-stage training scheme, UniMoT emerges as a multi-modal generalist capable of performing both molecule-to-text and text-to-molecule tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMoT achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of molecule comprehension and generation tasks.

  Evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models (LLMs) requires overcoming not only anthropomorphic but also anthropocentric biases. This article identifies two types of anthropocentric bias that have been neglected: overlooking how auxiliary factors can impede LLM performance despite competence ("auxiliary oversight"), and dismissing LLM mechanistic strategies that differ from those of humans as not genuinely competent ("mechanistic chauvinism"). Mitigating these biases necessitates an empirically-driven, iterative approach to mapping cognitive tasks to LLM-specific capacities and mechanisms, which can be done by supplementing carefully designed behavioral experiments with mechanistic studies.

  Mixture-of-experts (MoE) is gaining increasing attention due to its unique properties and remarkable performance, especially for language tasks. By sparsely activating a subset of parameters for each token, MoE architecture could increase the model size without sacrificing computational efficiency, achieving a better trade-off between performance and training costs. However, the underlying mechanism of MoE still lacks further exploration, and its modularization degree remains questionable. In this paper, we make an initial attempt to understand the inner workings of MoE-based large language models. Concretely, we comprehensively study the parametric and behavioral features of three popular MoE-based models and reveal some intriguing observations, including 1) Neurons act like fine-grained experts; 2) The router of MoE usually selects experts with larger output norms; 3) The expert diversity increases as the layer increases, while the last layer is an outlier, which is further validated by an initial experiment. Based on the observations, we also provide suggestions for a broad spectrum of MoE practitioners, such as router design and expert allocation. We hope this work could shed light on future research on the MoE framework and other modular architectures. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Political scientists increasingly analyze multimodal data. However, the effective analysis of such data requires aligning information across different modalities. In our paper, we demonstrate the significance of such alignment. Informed by a systematic review of 2,703 papers, we find that political scientists typically do not align their multimodal data. Introducing a decision tree that guides alignment choices, our framework highlights alignment's untapped potential and provides concrete advice in research design and modeling decisions. We illustrate alignment's analytical value through two applications: predicting tonality in U.S. presidential campaign ads and cross-modal querying of German parliamentary speeches to examine responses to the far-right AfD.

  Instruction tuning is a vital step of training large language models (LLM), so how to enhance the effect of instruction tuning has received increased attention. Existing works indicate that the quality of the dataset is more crucial than the quantity during instruction tuning of LLM. Therefore, recently a lot of studies focus on exploring the methods of selecting high-quality subset from instruction datasets, aiming to reduce training costs and enhance the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on data selection for LLM instruction tuning. Firstly, we introduce the wildly used instruction datasets. Then, we propose a new taxonomy of the data selection methods and provide a detailed introduction of recent advances,and the evaluation strategies and results of data selection methods are also elaborated in detail. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges and present new frontiers of this task.

Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

  _Runjia Li, Philip Torr, Andrea Vedaldi, Tomas Jakab_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control.

  We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic, temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond vehicles.

  _Kiymet Akdemir, Tahira Kazimi, Pinar Yanardag_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

  AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However, existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional, audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles, FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time? We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches, e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii) By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

  Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture accurately.

  In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks, including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field. Project Page:this https URLGitHub Link:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for spatio-temporal understanding.

  Accurate 6D pose estimation is key for robotic manipulation, enabling precise object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding. Experimental results on standard benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, particularly in handling occlusions and novel viewpoints.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories. Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3) prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation, improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

  Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and fixed-point prompt encoding to learn from the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). On COCO and LVIS, it achieves 51.9% and 44.9% mIoU, respectively. The quantized model (1.22MB) runs at 14.3 ms on the IMX500-achieving 86 MACs/cycle, making it the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP. These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host processing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.

  Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

  Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap, we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise comparisons.Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from 8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100 evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established evaluation resource.Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware comparison. The platform's community engagement establishes 3D Arena as a benchmark for the field while advancing understanding of human-centered evaluation in Generative 3D.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.

  We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across diverse game scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

  Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82% GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets. Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel combinations perform better than single-scale configurations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication. The dataset and code will open-source onthis https URL.

  Accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tornadoes is critically important for understanding and preparing for this highly destructive weather phenomenon. While modern 3D scene reconstruction techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), could provide a valuable tool for reconstructing the 3D structure of tornados, at present we are critically lacking a controlled tornado dataset with which to develop and validate these tools. In this work we capture and release a novel multiview dataset of a small lab-based tornado. We demonstrate one can effectively reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of this tornado using 3DGS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations, enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.

  Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

  Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive. Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused, implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors, SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However, designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2 imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering, resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings, surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing time series.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets. This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning), achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods. Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding, executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast, VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring, and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video generation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues. However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios.

  Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns. Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks. This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures. Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures, with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over 5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic spaces.

  We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic \underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure (HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets. To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

  Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR) method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the "Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading diffusion-based multi-view image generation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs. Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer (TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training convergence, and generalization.

  Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data, limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach. MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature utilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for clinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity reasoning.

  Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities, resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of current and future multimodal researches.

  Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation (LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail), respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods, achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

  Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios, relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation, and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation. Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions, incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2 staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment, as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users: supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

  _Sophia Sirko-Galouchenko, Spyros Gidaris, Antonin Vobecky, Andrei Bursuc, Nicolas Thome_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes, textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique. Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing, demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

  _Sijin He, Guangfeng Lin, Tao Li, Yajun Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention. The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings, which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust, efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical prognosis prediction workflows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight. This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification, enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas, demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable decision-making.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), yet existing open resources remain limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.

  We introduce OpenEvents V1, a large-scale benchmark dataset aimed at advancing event-centric vision-language understanding. Unlike conventional image captioning and retrieval datasets that emphasize surface-level descriptions, OpenEvents V1 focuses on contextual and temporal grounding through two primary tasks: (1) generating rich, event-aware image captions and (2) retrieving event-relevant images based on narrative-style textual queries. The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles and 400,000 associated images sourced from CNN and The Guardian, spanning diverse domains and time periods. We provide extensive baseline results and standardized evaluation protocols for both tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

  Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety, or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level. The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information, which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in enhancing classification performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder, emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders, outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods.

  Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but 3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this, we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation from natural language.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse, including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence, discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications, this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants: PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics, effectively balancing safety and usability.

  Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network, enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of 124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets, each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364 multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to 78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to the overall image context.

  Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values, atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in irrigated agricultural regions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm, and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages, respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2% compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

  Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However, conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions. OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in endoscopy.

  Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a) hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Prompt-based AI using LLMs, thereby enhancing their explanation capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed approaches leveraging object based precision metrics, and showcase the improvements in the inconsistency and completeness of image explanations. Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by 81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6% and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively) surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

  As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations. Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process. Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction, providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the future.

  Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet, and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

  3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However, in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning. Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG) module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

  Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE, featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE) module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and (2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1 designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1 first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future research and applications.

  _Xunzhi Xiang, Qi Fan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism, which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics, spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

  Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal disorders in under-resourced areas.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad applicability of our method across various materials, including those transparent in the visible spectrum.

  Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute differences ~1¬∞ when compared to clinical ground truth measurements. Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced clinical workflows.

  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear, especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF, frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for few-shot scenarios.

  While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10 classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot, 10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7% has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement. The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

  Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules, causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms, our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1 score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

  Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation. Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model. These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective, providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to video-based approaches.

  Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability. Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely, general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts, significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines, especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in medical diagnosis.

  Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First, we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision, guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value, detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds. Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection, establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

  Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and 46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities. Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor, Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably, it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8 A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

  Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture. The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI), employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed.

  Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering, answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all 7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy video-language understanding.

  Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood cell images. Our code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information, projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer, with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of 10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning approach.

  Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System, which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4 addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving performance comparable to that of 8B models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges. To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting, delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset (including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists, pathologists, and oncologists.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

  This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee, designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data. Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into layers and applying a novel feature fusion strategy to improve complex reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection. OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

  Markerless motion capture enables the tracking of human motion without requiring physical markers or suits, offering increased flexibility and reduced costs compared to traditional systems. However, these advantages often come at the expense of higher computational demands and slower inference, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios.

We describe the network architecture, training methodology, and inference procedure in detail.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations, such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating 40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while demonstrating greater robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception. However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and 88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 30.02 FPS.

  This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST). Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover, previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI. The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms, expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and operational settings.

  This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance.The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.

  Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features (e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases. In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed. Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space. In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods.

  Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images. While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

  We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features. Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Using possible feedback approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities. Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e., imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO over state-of-the-art competitors.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover, EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

  Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry, widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks. Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However, existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features. In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

  Cloud contamination significantly impairs the usability of optical satellite imagery, affecting critical applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land-use analysis. This research presents a Cloud-Attentive Reconstruction Framework that integrates SAR-optical feature fusion with deep learning-based image reconstruction to generate cloud-free optical imagery. The proposed framework employs an attention-driven feature fusion mechanism to align complementary structural information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with spectral characteristics from optical data. Furthermore, a cloud-aware model update strategy introduces adaptive loss weighting to prioritize cloud-occluded regions, enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving a PSNR of 31.01 dB, SSIM of 0.918, and MAE of 0.017. These outcomes highlight the framework's effectiveness in producing high-fidelity, spatially and spectrally consistent cloud-free optical images.

  _Zheng Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices. Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color (decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However, there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing complex procedural contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless, multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal 2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution. Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy, which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation (VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement) and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies, their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery. Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics.

  Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications. Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N. The code and models of our YOLOv13 model are available at:this https URL.

  Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest (ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement. However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static 3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world. To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to 3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence, producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:this https URL.

  Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual, or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs compared to traditional approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers, captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG, introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action recognition.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external tools.

  Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter- and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images, engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art works.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency, reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability. Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to disrupt SDE assumptions.We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4), whereas optimization-based methods fail.

  Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs) over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS, especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling, enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits. JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a 60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

  Purpose: To develop an age prediction model which is interpretable and robust to demographic and technological variances in brain MRI scans. Materials and Methods: We propose a transformer-based architecture that leverages self-supervised pre-training on large-scale datasets. Our model processes pseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity, enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia. Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15 years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12 years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of -0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused information from different views and volumetric information to achieve state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2) specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis, resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence. To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI} (\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

  _Le Yu, Kaishen Wang, Jianlong Xiong, Yue Cao, Tao He_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, they are still prone to hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust performance across multiple benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.

  _Chongkai Gao, Zixuan Liu, Zhenghao Chi, Junshan Huang, Xin Fei, Yiwen Hou, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies, often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive biases for computer vision.

  _Zhihao Yuan, Shuyi Jiang, Chun-Mei Feng, Yaolun Zhang, Shuguang Cui, Zhen Li, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D scene understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible, high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention, while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized equipment design, and motor skill development.

  _Julio Silva-Rodr√≠guez, Ismail Ben Ayed, Jose Dolz_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T), a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data. We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP, maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions. However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain. First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in challenging scenarios.

  Traditional particle size distribution (PSD) analyses create significant downtime and are expensive in labor and maintenance. These drawbacks could be alleviated using optical grain size analysis integrated into routine geotechnical laboratory workflow. This paper presents a high-resolution dataset of 12,714 images of 321 different soil samples collected in the Montreal, Quebec region, alongside their PSD analysis. It is designed to provide a robust starting point for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in geotechnical applications. Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view position with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per pixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9 inch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was used. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was employed for mass reduction.

  Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving, prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.

  Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant challenge due to complex distortions such as turbidity, low illumination, and occlusion, which severely degrade the performance of standard vision systems. This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner. This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%, and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and classification in complex wireless environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model. Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features, querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views. Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT, provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector (SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286 labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared to baselines, with limited computational resources.

  Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution (SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content reconstruction.

  The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality, efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8 object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable, and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and heterogeneous data streams.

  By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk, particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80 percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments. These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing, including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments. First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features, P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes. These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will be released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M) to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching, enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile, we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models, establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000 synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity (complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to 0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection (entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus 0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15). Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced, comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap caused by the discrepancy between single-label and multi-label data. An ablation study on our Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.

  Accurate mapping of agricultural field boundaries is essential for the efficient operation of agriculture. Automatic extraction from high-resolution satellite imagery, supported by computer vision techniques, can avoid costly ground surveys. In this paper, we present a pipeline for field delineation based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), introducing a fine-tuning strategy to adapt SAM to this task. In addition to using published datasets, we describe a method for acquiring a complementary regional dataset that covers areas beyond current sources. Extensive experiments assess segmentation accuracy and evaluate the generalization capabilities. Our approach provides a robust baseline for automated field delineation. The new regional dataset, known as ERAS, is now publicly available.

  Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution (LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models are well known for their ability to generate a high-fidelity image for an input prompt through an iterative denoising process. Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts. We empirically demonstrate on COCO and DiffusionDB that by learning to route to nine already-trained text-to-image models, our approach is able to deliver an average quality that is higher than that achievable by any of these models alone.

  Image restoration faces challenges including ineffective feature fusion, computational bottlenecks and inefficient diffusion processes. To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics. Our method establishes a new paradigm for adaptive, high-efficiency image restoration with optimized hardware utilization.

  The cornerstone of cognitive intelligence lies in extracting hidden patterns from observations and leveraging these principles to systematically predict future outcomes. However, current image tokenization methods demonstrate significant limitations in tasks requiring symbolic abstraction and logical reasoning capabilities essential for systematic inference. To address this challenge, we propose Discrete-JEPA, extending the latent predictive coding framework with semantic tokenization and novel complementary objectives to create robust tokenization for symbolic reasoning tasks. Discrete-JEPA dramatically outperforms baselines on visual symbolic prediction tasks, while striking visual evidence reveals the spontaneous emergence of deliberate systematic patterns within the learned semantic token space. Though an initial model, our approach promises a significant impact for advancing Symbolic world modeling and planning capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.

  The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE's ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

  This paper introduces a novel approach to person identification using hand images, designed specifically for criminal investigations. The method is particularly valuable in serious crimes such as sexual abuse, where hand images are often the only identifiable evidence available. Our proposed method, CLIP-HandID, leverages a pre-trained foundational vision-language model - CLIP - to efficiently learn discriminative deep feature representations from hand images (input to CLIP's image encoder) using textual prompts as semantic guidance. Since hand images are labeled with indexes rather than text descriptions, we employ a textual inversion network to learn pseudo-tokens that encode specific visual contexts or appearance attributes. These learned pseudo-tokens are then incorporated into textual prompts, which are fed into CLIP's text encoder to leverage its multi-modal reasoning and enhance generalization for identification. Through extensive evaluations on two large, publicly available hand datasets with multi-ethnic representation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models (VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. Following the LiMBeR framework, we deliberately maintain a frozen large language model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. By keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains its original language representations without adaptation to visual data. Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders (SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations gradually align with language feature representations, converging in middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation learning.

  Infertility has a considerable impact on individuals' quality of life, affecting them socially and psychologically, with projections indicating a rise in the upcoming years. In vitro fertilization (IVF) emerges as one of the primary techniques within economically developed nations, employed to address the rising problem of low fertility. Expert embryologists conventionally grade embryos by reviewing blastocyst images to select the most optimal for transfer, yet this process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Blastocyst images provide a valuable resource for assessing embryo viability. In this study, we introduce an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for classifying embryos, employing a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, referred to as CNN-LSTM. Utilizing deep learning, our model achieves high accuracy in embryo classification while maintaining interpretability through XAI.

  Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques, with 3D vision still relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However, by building on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields, some authors have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from independent 2D views, by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is particularly helpful in egocentric videos, where the camera motion is significant, but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In fact, as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields, 3D techniques are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena, and, in particular, when segmenting moving objects. In this paper, we look into this issue in more detail. First, we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion). However, the high complexity of long, dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric structure, and, as a result, hinders the fusion of motion cues into the (incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time refinement, which helps the model to focus on specific frames, thereby reducing the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the refinement, and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and realistic setting.

  PhysicsNeRF is a physically grounded framework for 3D reconstruction from sparse views, extending Neural Radiance Fields with four complementary constraints: depth ranking, RegNeRF-style consistency, sparsity priors, and cross-view alignment. While standard NeRFs fail under sparse supervision, PhysicsNeRF employs a compact 0.67M-parameter architecture and achieves 21.4 dB average PSNR using only 8 views, outperforming prior methods. A generalization gap of 5.7-6.2 dB is consistently observed and analyzed, revealing fundamental limitations of sparse-view reconstruction. PhysicsNeRF enables physically consistent, generalizable 3D representations for agent interaction and simulation, and clarifies the expressiveness-generalization trade-off in constrained NeRF models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual question answering (VQA) systems face significant challenges when adapting to real-world data shifts, especially in multi-modal contexts. While robust fine-tuning strategies are essential for maintaining performance across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, current evaluation settings are primarily unimodal or particular to some types of OOD, offering limited insight into the complexities of multi-modal contexts. In this work, we propose a new benchmark FRAMES-VQA (Fine-Tuning Robustness across Multi-Modal Shifts in VQA) for evaluating robust fine-tuning for VQA tasks. We utilize ten existing VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, IV-VQA, VQA-CP, OK-VQA and others, and categorize them into ID, near and far OOD datasets covering uni-modal, multi-modal and adversarial distribution shifts. We first conduct a comprehensive comparison of existing robust fine-tuning methods. We then quantify the distribution shifts by calculating the Mahalanobis distance using uni-modal and multi-modal embeddings extracted from various models. Further, we perform an extensive analysis to explore the interactions between uni- and multi-modal shifts as well as modality importance for ID and OOD samples. These analyses offer valuable guidance on developing more robust fine-tuning methods to handle multi-modal distribution shifts. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. The code is \href{this https URL}{here}.

- **[Holistic White-light Polyp Classification via Alignment-free Dense Distillation of Auxiliary Optical Chromoendoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19319)**  `arXiv:2505.19319`  
  _Qiang Hu, Qimei Wang, Jia Chen, Xuantao Ji, Qiang Li, Zhiwei Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  White Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are the two main colonoscopic modalities for polyp classification. While NBI, as optical chromoendoscopy, offers valuable vascular details, WLI remains the most common and often the only available modality in resource-limited settings. However, WLI-based methods typically underperform, limiting their clinical applicability. Existing approaches transfer knowledge from NBI to WLI through global feature alignment but often rely on cropped lesion regions, which are susceptible to detection errors and neglect contextual and subtle diagnostic cues. To address this, this paper proposes a novel holistic classification framework that leverages full-image diagnosis without requiring polyp localization. The key innovation lies in the Alignment-free Dense Distillation (ADD) module, which enables fine-grained cross-domain knowledge distillation regardless of misalignment between WLI and NBI images. Without resorting to explicit image alignment, ADD learns pixel-wise cross-domain affinities to establish correspondences between feature maps, guiding the distillation along the most relevant pixel connections. To further enhance distillation reliability, ADD incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to filter cross-domain affinities, ensuring the distillation path connects only those semantically consistent regions with equal contributions to polyp diagnosis. Extensive results on public and in-house datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, relatively outperforming the other approaches by at least 2.5% and 16.2% in AUC, respectively.

  _Florian Barthel, Wieland Morgenstern, Paul Hinzer, Anna Hilsmann, Peter Eisert_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency, as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions, focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D scene generation. Check our our project page here:this https URL

  The brain is a highly complex organ that manages many important tasks, including movement, memory and thinking. Brain-related conditions, like tumors and degenerative disorders, can be hard to diagnose and treat. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) serves as a key tool for identifying these conditions, offering high-resolution images of brain structures. Despite this, interpreting MRI scans can be complicated. This study tackles this challenge by conducting a comparative analysis of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Transfer Learning (TL) models such as VGG16, VGG19, Resnet50V2, MobilenetV2 for classifying brain diseases using MRI data from Bangladesh based dataset. ViT, known for their ability to capture global relationships in images, are particularly effective for medical imaging tasks. Transfer learning helps to mitigate data constraints by fine-tuning pre-trained models. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) methods such as GradCAM, GradCAM++, LayerCAM, ScoreCAM, and Faster-ScoreCAM are employed to interpret model predictions. The results demonstrate that ViT surpasses transfer learning models, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.39%. The integration of XAI methods enhances model transparency, offering crucial insights to aid medical professionals in diagnosing brain diseases with greater precision.

  Spatial perception and reasoning are core components of human cognition, encompassing object recognition, spatial relational understanding, and dynamic reasoning. Despite progress in computer vision, existing benchmarks reveal significant gaps in models' abilities to accurately recognize object attributes and reason about spatial relationships, both essential for dynamic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose MIRAGE, a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate models' capabilities in Counting (object attribute recognition), Relation (spatial relational reasoning), and Counting with Relation. Through diverse and complex scenarios requiring fine-grained recognition and reasoning, MIRAGE highlights critical limitations in state-of-the-art models, underscoring the need for improved representations and reasoning frameworks. By targeting these foundational abilities, MIRAGE provides a pathway toward spatiotemporal reasoning in future research.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language. Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports. However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2 images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale, problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports, we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely used in image editing due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, achieving fine-grained control over specific object attributes, such as color and material, remains a considerable challenge. Existing methods often fail to accurately modify these attributes or compromise structural integrity and overall image consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Structure Preservation and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a novel training-free framework that enables precise generation of color and material attributes for the same object by intelligently manipulating self-attention maps and cross-attention values within diffusion models. Building on SPAA, we integrate multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to automate data curation and instruction generation. Leveraging this object attribute data collection engine, we construct the Attribute Dataset, encompassing a comprehensive range of colors and materials across diverse object categories. Using this generated dataset, we propose InstructAttribute, an instruction-tuned model that enables fine-grained and object-level attribute editing through natural language prompts. This capability holds significant practical implications for diverse fields, from accelerating product design and e-commerce visualization to enhancing virtual try-on experiences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructAttribute outperforms existing instruction-based baselines, achieving a superior balance between attribute modification accuracy and structural preservation.

  Diabetic retinopathy is a severe eye condition caused by diabetes where the retinal blood vessels get damaged and can lead to vision loss and blindness if not treated. Early and accurate detection is key to intervention and stopping the disease progressing. For addressing this disease properly, this paper presents a comprehensive approach for automated diabetic retinopathy detection by proposing a new hybrid deep learning model called VR-FuseNet. Diabetic retinopathy is a major eye disease and leading cause of blindness especially among diabetic patients so accurate and efficient automated detection methods are required. To address the limitations of existing methods including dataset imbalance, diversity and generalization issues this paper presents a hybrid dataset created from five publicly available diabetic retinopathy datasets. Essential preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE for class balancing and CLAHE for image enhancement are applied systematically to the dataset to improve the robustness and generalizability of the dataset. The proposed VR-FuseNet model combines the strengths of two state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, VGG19 which captures fine-grained spatial features and ResNet50V2 which is known for its deep hierarchical feature extraction. This fusion improves the diagnostic performance and achieves an accuracy of 91.824%. The model outperforms individual architectures on all performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid feature extraction in Diabetic Retinopathy classification tasks. To make the proposed model more clinically useful and interpretable this paper incorporates multiple XAI techniques. These techniques generate visual explanations that clearly indicate the retinal features affecting the model's prediction such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages and exudates so that clinicians can interpret and validate.

  In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.

  We present Kimi-VL, an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model (VLM) that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities - all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B). Kimi-VL demonstrates strong performance across challenging domains: as a general-purpose VLM, Kimi-VL excels in multi-turn agent tasks (e.g., OSWorld), matching flagship models. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable capabilities across diverse challenging vision language tasks, including college-level image and video comprehension, OCR, mathematical reasoning, and multi-image understanding. In comparative evaluations, it effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs such as GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and Gemma-3-12B-IT, while surpassing GPT-4o in several key domains. Kimi-VL also advances in processing long contexts and perceiving clearly. With a 128K extended context window, Kimi-VL can process diverse long inputs, achieving impressive scores of 64.5 on LongVideoBench and 35.1 on MMLongBench-Doc. Its native-resolution vision encoder, MoonViT, further allows it to see and understand ultra-high-resolution visual inputs, achieving 83.2 on InfoVQA and 34.5 on ScreenSpot-Pro, while maintaining lower computational cost for common tasks. Building upon Kimi-VL, we introduce an advanced long-thinking variant: Kimi-VL-Thinking-2506. Developed through long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), the latest model exhibits strong long-horizon reasoning capabilities (64.0 on MMMU, 46.3 on MMMU-Pro, 56.9 on MathVision, 80.1 on MathVista, 65.2 on VideoMMMU) while obtaining robust general abilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool (SALT) for general LiDAR point clouds with cross-scene adaptability and 4D consistency. Unlike recent approaches that rely on camera distillation, SALT operates directly on raw LiDAR data, automatically generating pre-segmentation results. To achieve this, we propose a novel zero-shot learning paradigm, termed data alignment, which transforms LiDAR data into pseudo-images by aligning with the training distribution of vision foundation models. Additionally, we design a 4D-consistent prompting strategy and 4D non-maximum suppression module to enhance SAM2, ensuring high-quality, temporally consistent presegmentation. SALT surpasses the latest zero-shot methods by 18.4% PQ on SemanticKITTI and achieves nearly 40-50% of human annotator performance on our newly collected low-resolution LiDAR data and on combined data from three LiDAR types, significantly boosting annotation efficiency. We anticipate that SALT's open-sourcing will catalyze substantial expansion of current LiDAR datasets and lay the groundwork for the future development of LiDAR foundation models.

  Gating mechanisms have emerged as an effective strategy integrated into model designs beyond recurrent neural networks for addressing long-range dependency problems. In a broad understanding, it provides adaptive control over the information flow while maintaining computational efficiency. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis on how the gating mechanism works in neural networks. In this paper, inspired by the \textit{convolution theorem}, we systematically explore the effect of gating mechanisms on the training dynamics of neural networks from a frequency perspective. We investigate the interact between the element-wise product and activation functions in managing the responses to different frequency components. Leveraging these insights, we propose a Gating Mechanism Network (GmNet), a lightweight model designed to efficiently utilize the information of various frequency components. It minimizes the low-frequency bias present in existing lightweight models. GmNet achieves impressive performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency in the image classification task.

  The development of Generalist Virtual Agents (GVAs) has shown significant promise in autonomous task execution. However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-Wise Multi-Dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling.

  The increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer vision technologies underscore the particular importance of conducting research on the accuracy of traffic sign recognition. Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traditional machine learning models for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) rely on supervised training, requiring extensive manual annotations, and often produce errors due to the separation between layout and text processing. In contrast, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a general approach to recognizing diverse handwriting styles without the need for model-specific training. The study benchmarks various proprietary and open-source LLMs against Transkribus models, evaluating their performance on both modern and historical datasets written in English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, emphasis is placed on testing the models' ability to autonomously correct previously generated outputs. Findings indicate that proprietary models, especially Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperform open-source alternatives in zero-shot settings. MLLMs achieve excellent results in recognizing modern handwriting and exhibit a preference for the English language due to their pre-training dataset composition. Comparisons with Transkribus show no consistent advantage for either approach. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate limited ability to autonomously correct errors in zero-shot transcriptions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental objective of manipulation policy design is to endow robots to comprehend human instructions, reason about scene cues, and execute generalized actions in dynamic environments. Recent autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) methods inherit common-sense reasoning capabilities from vision-language models (VLMs) for next action-token prediction. However, these methods quantize actions into discrete bins, which disrupts the continuity required for precise control. In contrast, existing diffusion-based VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions solely conditioned on feature representations extracted by the VLM, without fully leveraging the VLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities through token-level generation. To address these limitations, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14\% and 19\% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.

Using Tweedie's formula, our method performs denoising in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thus improving both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Clouds as a denoising quality metric, which allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks among unsupervised learning methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics. Noise2Score3D also demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Our method, by addressing the generalization issue and challenge of the absence of clean data in learning-based methods, paves the way for learning-based point cloud denoising methods in real-world applications.

  Accurate, real-time object detection on resource-constrained hardware is critical for anomaly-behavior monitoring. We introduce HGO-YOLO, a lightweight detector that combines GhostHGNetv2 with an optimized parameter-sharing head (OptiConvDetect) to deliver an outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-off. By embedding GhostConv into the HGNetv2 backbone with multi-scale residual fusion, the receptive field is enlarged while redundant computation is reduced by 50%. OptiConvDetect shares a partial-convolution layer for the classification and regression branches, cutting detection-head FLOPs by 41% without accuracy loss. On three anomaly datasets (fall, fight, smoke), HGO-YOLO attains 87.4% mAP@0.5 and 81.1% recall at 56 FPS on a single CPU with just 4.3 GFLOPs and 4.6 MB-surpassing YOLOv8n by +3.0% mAP, -51.7% FLOPs, and 1.7* speed.

  _Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Huayu Chen, Guande He, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While likelihood-based generative models, particularly diffusion and autoregressive models, have achieved remarkable fidelity in visual generation, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective, which minimizes the forward KL divergence, inherently suffers from a mode-covering tendency that limits the generation quality under limited model capacity. In this work, we propose Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) as a unified framework that integrates likelihood-based generative training and GAN-type discrimination to bypass this fundamental constraint by exploiting reverse KL and self-generated negative signals. Our key insight is to parameterize a discriminator implicitly using the likelihood ratio between a learnable target model and a fixed reference model, drawing parallels with the philosophy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike GANs, this parameterization eliminates the need for joint training of generator and discriminator networks, allowing for direct, efficient, and effective finetuning of a well-trained model to its full potential beyond the limits of MLE. DDO can be performed iteratively in a self-play manner for progressive model refinement, with each round requiring less than 1% of pretraining epochs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DDO by significantly advancing the previous SOTA diffusion model EDM, reducing FID scores from 1.79/1.58/1.96 to new records of 1.30/0.97/1.26 on CIFAR-10/ImageNet-64/ImageNet 512x512 datasets without any guidance mechanisms, and by consistently improving both guidance-free and CFG-enhanced FIDs of visual autoregressive models on ImageNet 256x256.

  This work introduces ILIAS, a new test dataset for Instance-Level Image retrieval At Scale. It is designed to evaluate the ability of current and future foundation models and retrieval techniques to recognize particular objects. The key benefits over existing datasets include large scale, domain diversity, accurate ground truth, and a performance that is far from saturated. ILIAS includes query and positive images for 1,000 object instances, manually collected to capture challenging conditions and diverse domains. Large-scale retrieval is conducted against 100 million distractor images from YFCC100M. To avoid false negatives without extra annotation effort, we include only query objects confirmed to have emerged after 2014, i.e. the compilation date of YFCC100M. An extensive benchmarking is performed with the following observations: i) models fine-tuned on specific domains, such as landmarks or products, excel in that domain but fail on ILIAS ii) learning a linear adaptation layer using multi-domain class supervision results in performance improvements, especially for vision-language models iii) local descriptors in retrieval re-ranking are still a key ingredient, especially in the presence of severe background clutter iv) the text-to-image performance of the vision-language foundation models is surprisingly close to the corresponding image-to-image case. website:this https URL

  Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to alleviate the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.10%, 50.98%, and 43.10% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding. The code is released atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Many keypoint detection and description methods have been proposed for image matching or registration. While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. %, our approach generates robust and invariant features across diverse and unknown modalities. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality. Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and VideoCrafter2, resulting in consistent performance improvements across the board.

  Non-invasive temperature monitoring of individuals plays a crucial role in identifying and isolating symptomatic individuals. Temperature monitoring becomes particularly vital in settings characterized by close human proximity, often referred to as dense settings. However, existing research on non-invasive temperature estimation using thermal cameras has predominantly focused on sparse settings. Unfortunately, the risk of disease transmission is significantly higher in dense settings like movie theaters or classrooms. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust temperature estimation methods tailored explicitly for dense settings.Our study proposes a non-invasive temperature estimation system that combines a thermal camera with an edge device. Our system employs YOLO models for face detection and utilizes a regression framework for temperature estimation. We evaluated the system on a diverse dataset collected in dense and sparse settings. Our proposed face detection model achieves an impressive mAP score of over 84 in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Furthermore, the regression framework demonstrates remarkable performance with a mean square error of 0.18$^{\circ}$C and an impressive $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our experiments' results highlight the developed system's effectiveness, positioning it as a promising solution for continuous temperature monitoring in real-world applications. With this paper, we release our dataset and programming code publicly.

  The generation of anchor-style product promotion videos presents promising opportunities in e-commerce, advertising, and consumer engagement. Despite advancements in pose-guided human video generation, creating product promotion videos remains challenging. In addressing this challenge, we identify the integration of human-object interactions (HOI) into pose-guided human video generation as a core issue. To this end, we introduce AnchorCrafter, a novel diffusion-based system designed to generate 2D videos featuring a target human and a customized object, achieving high visual fidelity and controllable interactions. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: the HOI-appearance perception, which enhances object appearance recognition from arbitrary multi-view perspectives and disentangles object and human appearance, and the HOI-motion injection, which enables complex human-object interactions by overcoming challenges in object trajectory conditioning and inter-occlusion management. Extensive experiments show that our system improves object appearance preservation by 7.5\% and doubles the object localization accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. It also outperforms existing approaches in maintaining human motion consistency and high-quality video generation. Project page including data, code, and Huggingface demo:this https URL.

  _Yuxuan Yang, Tao Geng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Interior design is a complex and creative discipline involving aesthetics, functionality, ergonomics, and materials science. Effective solutions must meet diverse requirements, typically producing multiple deliverables such as renderings and design drawings from various perspectives. Consequently, interior design processes are often inefficient and demand significant creativity. With advances in machine learning, generative models have emerged as a promising means of improving efficiency by creating designs from text descriptions or sketches. However, few generative works focus on interior design, leading to substantial discrepancies between outputs and practical needs, such as differences in size, spatial scope, and the lack of controllable generation quality. To address these challenges, we propose DiffDesign, a controllable diffusion model with meta priors for efficient interior design generation. Specifically, we utilize the generative priors of a 2D diffusion model pre-trained on a large image dataset as our rendering backbone. We further guide the denoising process by disentangling cross-attention control over design attributes, such as appearance, pose, and size, and introduce an optimal transfer-based alignment module to enforce view consistency. Simultaneously, we construct an interior design-specific dataset, DesignHelper, consisting of over 400 solutions across more than 15 spatial types and 15 design styles. This dataset helps fine-tune DiffDesign. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DiffDesign.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While different variants of perceptual losses have been employed in super-resolution literature to synthesize more realistic, appealing, and detailed high-resolution images, most are convolutional neural networks-based, causing information loss during guidance and often relying on complicated architectures and training procedures. We propose an invertible neural network (INN)-based naive \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{G}ranular \textbf{H}igh-\textbf{F}requency (MGHF-n) perceptual loss trained on ImageNet to overcome these issues. Furthermore, we develop a comprehensive framework (MGHF-c) with several constraints to preserve, prioritize, and regularize information across multiple perspectives: texture and style preservation, content preservation, regional detail preservation, and joint content-style regularization. Information is prioritized through adaptive entropy-based pruning and reweighting of INN features. We utilize Gram matrix loss for style preservation and mean-squared error loss for content preservation. Additionally, we propose content-style consistency through correlation loss to regulate unnecessary texture generation while preserving content information. Since small image regions may contain intricate details, we employ modulated PatchNCE in the INN features as a local information preservation objective. Extensive experiments on various super-resolution algorithms, including GAN- and diffusion-based methods, demonstrate that our MGHF framework significantly improves performance. After the review process, our code will be released in the public repository.

  _Yifan Wang, Xiaochen Yang, Fanqi Pu, Qingmin Liao, Wenming Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular 3D object detection has attracted great attention due to simplicity and low cost. Existing methods typically follow conventional 2D detection paradigms, first locating object centers and then predicting 3D attributes via neighboring features. However, these methods predominantly rely on progressive cross-scale feature aggregation and focus solely on local information, which may result in a lack of global awareness and the omission of small-scale objects. In addition, due to large variation in object scales across different scenes and depths, inaccurate receptive fields often lead to background noise and degraded feature representation. To address these issues, we introduces MonoASRH, a novel monocular 3D detection framework composed of Efficient Hybrid Feature Aggregation Module (EH-FAM) and Adaptive Scale-Aware 3D Regression Head (ASRH). Specifically, EH-FAM employs multi-head attention with a global receptive field to extract semantic features for small-scale objects and leverages lightweight convolutional modules to efficiently aggregate visual features across different scales. The ASRH encodes 2D bounding box dimensions and then fuses scale features with the semantic features aggregated by EH-FAM through a scale-semantic feature fusion module. The scale-semantic feature fusion module guides ASRH in learning dynamic receptive field offsets, incorporating scale priors into 3D position prediction for better scale-awareness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate that MonoASRH achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

  Vision-centric autonomous driving has demonstrated excellent performance with economical sensors. As the fundamental step, 3D perception aims to infer 3D information from 2D images based on 3D-2D projection. This makes driving perception models susceptible to sensor configuration (e.g., camera intrinsics and extrinsics) variations. However, generalizing across camera configurations is important for deploying autonomous driving models on different car models. In this paper, we present UniDrive, a novel framework for vision-centric autonomous driving to achieve universal perception across camera configurations. We deploy a set of unified virtual cameras and propose a ground-aware projection method to effectively transform the original images into these unified virtual views. We further propose a virtual configuration optimization method by minimizing the expected projection error between original and virtual cameras. The proposed virtual camera projection can be applied to existing 3D perception methods as a plug-and-play module to mitigate the challenges posed by camera parameter variability, resulting in more adaptable and reliable driving perception models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we collect a dataset on CARLA by driving the same routes while only modifying the camera configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method trained on one specific camera configuration can generalize to varying configurations with minor performance degradation.

  Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

  Medical image classification plays a crucial role in clinical decision-making, yet most models are constrained to a fixed set of predefined classes, limiting their adaptability to new conditions. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers, such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles, directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretablethis http URLsupport further research, we use public datasets and provide our codebase and preprocessing pipeline underthis https URL, serving as a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.

  Large foundation models, known for their strong zero-shot generalization capabilities, can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, developing foundation models for medical image segmentation poses a significant challenge due to the domain gap between natural and medical images. While fine-tuning techniques based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have been explored, they primarily focus on scaling up data or refining inference strategies without incorporating domain-specific architectural designs, limiting their zero-shot performance. To optimize segmentation performance under standard inference settings and provide a strong baseline for future research, we introduce SyncSAM, which employs a synchronized dual-branch encoder that integrates convolution and Transformer features in a synchronized manner to enhance medical image encoding, and a multi-scale dual-branch decoder to preserve image details. SyncSAM is trained on two of the largest medical image segmentation datasets, SA-Med2D-20M and IMed-361M, resulting in a series of pre-trained models for universal medical image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SyncSAM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on test sets but also exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on unseen datasets.

  Accurate real-time object detection is vital across numerous industrial applications, from safety monitoring to quality control. Traditional approaches, however, are hindered by arduous manual annotation and data collection, struggling to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an innovative automated end-to-end pipeline that revolutionizes object detection workflows from data collection to model evaluation. It eliminates the need for laborious human labeling and extensive data collection while achieving outstanding accuracy across diverse scenarios. DART encompasses four key stages: (1) Data Diversification using subject-driven image generation (DreamBooth with SDXL), (2) Annotation via open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) to generate bounding box and class labels, (3) Review of generated images and pseudo-labels by large multimodal models (InternVL-1.5 and GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility, and (4) Training of real-time object detectors (YOLOv8 and YOLOv10) using the verified data. We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current instantiation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Its modular design ensures easy exchangeability and extensibility, allowing for future algorithm upgrades, seamless integration of new object categories, and adaptability to customized environments without manual labeling and additional data collection.

  Object detection has greatly improved over the past decade thanks to advances in deep learning and large-scale datasets. However, detecting objects reflected in surfaces remains an underexplored area. Reflective surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, appearing in homes, offices, public spaces, and natural environments. Accurate detection and interpretation of reflected objects are essential for various applications. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a extensive benchmark specifically designed for Reflected Object Detection. Our Reflected Object Detection Dataset (RODD) features a diverse collection of images showcasing reflected objects in various contexts, providing standard annotations for both real and reflected objects. This distinguishes it from traditional object detection benchmarks. RODD encompasses 10 categories and includes 21,059 images of real and reflected objects across different backgrounds, complete with standard bounding box annotations and the classification of objects as real or reflected. Additionally, we present baseline results by adapting five state-of-the-art object detection models to address this challenging task. Experimental results underscore the limitations of existing methods when applied to reflected object detection, highlighting the need for specialized approaches. By releasing RODD, we aim to support and advance future research on detecting reflected objects. Dataset and code are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Since rainy weather always degrades image quality and poses significant challenges to most computer vision-based intelligent systems, image de-raining has been a hot research topic. Fortunately, in a rainy light field (LF) image, background obscured by rain streaks in one sub-view may be visible in the other sub-views, and implicit depth information and recorded 4D structural information may benefit rain streak detection and removal. However, existing LF image rain removal methods either do not fully exploit the global correlations of 4D LF data or only utilize partial sub-views, resulting in sub-optimal rain removal performance and no-equally good quality for all de-rained sub-views. In this paper, we propose an efficient network, called MDeRainNet, for rain streak removal from LF images. The proposed network adopts a multi-scale encoder-decoder architecture, which directly works on Macro-pixel images (MPIs) to improve the rain removal performance. To fully model the global correlation between the spatial and the angular information, we propose an Extended Spatial-Angular Interaction (ESAI) module to merge them, in which a simple and effective Transformer-based Spatial-Angular Interaction Attention (SAIA) block is also proposed for modeling long-range geometric correlations and making full use of the angular information. Furthermore, to improve the generalization performance of our network on real-world rainy scenes, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for our MDeRainNet, which utilizes multi-level KL loss to bridge the domain gap between features of synthetic and real-world rain streaks and introduces colored-residue image guided contrastive regularization to reconstruct rain-free images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world LFIs demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As one of the tasks in Image Fusion, Infrared and Visible Image Fusion aims to integrate complementary information captured by sensors of different modalities into a single image. The Selective State Space Model (SSSM), known for its ability to capture long-range dependencies, has demonstrated its potential in the field of computer vision. However, in image fusion, current methods underestimate the potential of SSSM in capturing the global spatial information of both modalities. This limitation prevents the simultaneous consideration of the global spatial information from both modalities during interaction, leading to a lack of comprehensive perception of salient targets. Consequently, the fusion results tend to bias towards one modality instead of adaptively preserving salient targets. To address this issue, we propose the Saliency-aware Selective State Space Fusion Model (S4Fusion). In our S4Fusion, the designed Cross-Modal Spatial Awareness Module (CMSA) can simultaneously focus on global spatial information from both modalities while facilitating their interaction, thereby comprehensively capturing complementary information. Additionally, S4Fusion leverages a pre-trained network to perceive uncertainty in the fused images. By minimizing this uncertainty, S4Fusion adaptively highlights salient targets from both images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality images and enhances performance in downstream tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerous applications have resulted from the automation of agricultural disease segmentation using deep learning techniques. However, when applied to new conditions, these applications frequently face the difficulty of overfitting, resulting in lower segmentation performance. In the context of potato farming, where diseases have a large influence on yields, it is critical for the agricultural economy to quickly and properly identify these diseases. Traditional data augmentation approaches, such as rotation, flip, and translation, have limitations and frequently fail to provide strong generalization results. To address these issues, our research employs a novel approach termed as PotatoGANs. In this novel data augmentation approach, two types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to generate synthetic potato disease images from healthy potato images. This approach not only expands the dataset but also adds variety, which helps to enhance model generalization. Using the Inception score as a measure, our experiments show the better quality and realisticness of the images created by PotatoGANs, emphasizing their capacity to resemble real disease images closely. The CycleGAN model outperforms the Pix2Pix GAN model in terms of image quality, as evidenced by its higher IS scores CycleGAN achieves higher Inception scores (IS) of 1.2001 and 1.0900 for black scurf and common scab, respectively. This synthetic data can significantly improve the training of large neural networks. It also reduces data collection costs while enhancing data diversity and generalization capabilities. Our work improves interpretability by combining three gradient-based Explainable AI algorithms (GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM) with three distinct CNN architectures (DenseNet169, Resnet152 V2, InceptionResNet V2) for potato disease classification.

  _Yunfeng Li, Bo Wang, Ye Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The main problem in RGB-T tracking is the correct and optimal merging of the cross-modal features of visible and thermal images. Some previous methods either do not fully exploit the potential of RGB and TIR information for channel and spatial feature fusion or lack a direct interaction between the template and the search area, which limits the model's ability to fully utilize the original semantic information of both modalities. To address these limitations, we investigate how to achieve a direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features in RGB-T tracking and propose CSTNet. It uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone and adds a Joint Spatial and Channel Fusion Module (JSCFM) and Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) integrated between the transformer blocks to facilitate cross-modal feature interaction. The JSCFM module achieves joint modeling of channel and multi-level spatial features. The SFM module includes a cross-attention-like architecture for cross modeling and joint learning of RGB and TIR features. Comprehensive experiments show that CSTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To enhance practicality, we retrain the model without JSCFM and SFM modules and use CSNet as the pretraining weight, and propose CSTNet-small, which achieves 50% speedup with an average decrease of 1-2% in SR and PR performance. CSTNet and CSTNet-small achieve real-time speeds of 21 fps and 33 fps on the Nvidia Jetson Xavier, meeting actual deployment requirements. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Exploiting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) models for open-vocabulary 3D semantic understanding of indoor scenes has emerged as an attractive research focus. Existing methods typically attach high-dimensional CLIP semantic embeddings to 3D Gaussians and leverage view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics as Gaussian supervision, resulting in efficiency bottlenecks and deficient 3D semantic consistency. To address these challenges, we present CLIP-GS, efficiently achieving a coherent semantic understanding of 3D indoor scenes via the proposed Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) and 3D Coherent Regularization (3DCR). SAC approach exploits the naturally unified semantics within objects to learn compact, yet effective, semantic Gaussian representations, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). 3DCR enforces semantic consistency in 2D and 3D domains: In 2D, 3DCR utilizes refined view-consistent semantic outcomes derived from 3DGS to establish cross-view coherence constraints; in 3D, 3DCR encourages features similar among 3D Gaussian primitives associated with the same object, leading to more precise and coherent segmentation results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably suppresses existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving mIoU improvements of 21.20% and 13.05% on ScanNet and Replica datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, substantiating its robustness.

  Retinal fundus images play a crucial role in the early detection of eye diseases. However, the impact of technical factors on these images can pose challenges for reliable AI applications in ophthalmology. For example, large fundus cohorts are often confounded by factors like camera type, bearing the risk of learning shortcuts rather than the causal relationships behind the image generation process. Here, we introduce a population model for retinal fundus images that effectively disentangles patient attributes from camera effects, enabling controllable and highly realistic image generation. To achieve this, we propose a disentanglement loss based on distance correlation. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we show that our models encode desired information in disentangled subspaces and enable controllable image generation based on the learned subspaces, demonstrating the effectiveness of our disentanglement loss. The project's code is publicly available:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved great success in image generation tasks. However, the lengthy denoising process and complex neural networks hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Quantization can effectively reduce model complexity, and post-training quantization (PTQ), which does not require fine-tuning, is highly promising for compressing and accelerating diffusion models. Unfortunately, we find that due to the highly dynamic activations, existing PTQ methods suffer from distribution mismatch issues at both calibration sample level and reconstruction output level, which makes the performance far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose EDA-DM, a standardized PTQ method that efficiently addresses the above issues. Specifically, at the calibration sample level, we extract information from the density and diversity of latent space feature maps, which guides the selection of calibration samples to align with the overall sample distribution; and at the reconstruction output level, we theoretically analyze the reasons for previous reconstruction failures and, based on this insight, optimize block reconstruction using the Hessian loss of layers, aligning the outputs of quantized model and full-precision model at different network granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDA-DM significantly outperforms the existing PTQ methods across various models and datasets. Our method achieves a 1.83 times speedup and 4 times compression for the popular Stable-Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.05 loss in CLIP score. Code is available atthis http URL.

  In recent years, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has gradually become mainstream in various computer vision tasks, and the robustness of the model has received increasing attention. However, existing large models tend to prioritize performance during training, potentially neglecting the robustness, which may lead to serious security concerns. In this paper, we establish a new challenge: exploring how to use a small number of additional parameters for adversarial finetuning to quickly and effectively enhance the adversarial robustness of a standardly trained model. To address this challenge, we develop novel LNLoRA module, incorporating a learnable layer normalization before the conventional LoRA module, which helps mitigate magnitude differences in parameters between the adversarial and standard training paradigms. Furthermore, we propose the FullLoRA framework by integrating the learnable LNLoRA modules into all key components of ViT-based models while keeping the pretrained model frozen, which can significantly improve the model robustness via adversarial finetuning in a parameter-efficient manner. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FullLoRA framework. It achieves comparable robustness with full finetuning while only requiring about 5\% of the learnable parameters. This also effectively addresses concerns regarding extra model storage space and enormous training time caused by adversarial finetuning.

  The area of temporally fine-grained video representation learning focuses on generating frame-by-frame representations for temporally dense tasks, such as fine-grained action phase classification and frame retrieval. In this work, we advance the state-of-the-art for self-supervised models in this area by re-examining the design of transformer architectures for video representation learning. A key aspect of our approach is the improved sharing of scene information in the temporal pipeline by representing multiple salient entities per frame. Prior works use late-fusion architectures that reduce frames to a single-dimensional vector before modeling any cross-frame dynamics. In contrast, our Multi-entity Video Transformer (MV-Former) processes the frames as groups of entities represented as tokens linked across time. To achieve this, we propose a Learnable Spatial Token Pooling strategy to identify and extract features for multiple salient regions per frame. Through our experiments, we show that MV-Former outperforms previous self-supervised methods, and also surpasses some prior works that use additional supervision or training data. When combined with additional pre-training data from Kinetics-400, MV-Former achieves a further performance boost. Overall, our MV-Former achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple fine-grained video benchmarks and shows that parsing video scenes as collections of entities can enhance performance in video tasks.

  Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to detect all the visual relation triplets <sub, pred, obj> in a given image. With the emergence of various advanced techniques for better utilizing both the intrinsic and extrinsic information in each relation triplet, SGG has achieved great progress over the recent years. However, due to the ubiquitous long-tailed predicate distributions, today's SGG models are still easily biased to the head predicates. Currently, the most prevalent debiasing solutions for SGG are re-balancing methods, e.g., changing the distributions of original training samples. In this paper, we argue that all existing re-balancing strategies fail to increase the diversity of the relation triplet features of each predicate, which is critical for robust SGG. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-level Compositional Feature Augmentation (MCFA) strategy, which aims to mitigate the bias issue from the perspective of increasing the diversity of triplet features. Specifically, we enhance relationship diversity on not only feature-level, i.e., replacing the intrinsic or extrinsic visual features of triplets with other correlated samples to create novel feature compositions for tail predicates, but also image-level, i.e., manipulating the image to generate brand new visual appearance for triplets. Due to its model-agnostic nature, MCFA can be seamlessly incorporated into various SGG frameworks. Extensive ablations have shown that MCFA achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the trade-off between different metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), it has become a common practice to train models on synthetic data due to data-scarcity and privacy leakage problems. Owing to massive and diverse information conveyed in real images, it is challenging for text-to-image generative models to synthesize informative training data with hand-crafted prompts. Considering the impressive ability of large generative models, could such models directly synthesize good training images for prediction tasks with proper prompts? We offer an affirmative response to this question by proposing a simple yet effective method, validated through ImageNet classification. Specifically, we caption each real image with the advanced captioning model to obtain informative and faithful prompts that extract class-relevant information and clarify the polysemy of class names. The image captions and class names are concatenated to prompt generative models for training image synthesis. We show that this simple caption incorporation significantly boosts the informativeness of synthetic data therefore enhancing downstream model generalization. More importantly, besides improvements in data augmentation and privacy preservation, our experiments demonstrate that synthesized images can exceed real data in terms of out-of-distribution robustness.

  Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

  In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial Learning method between the association network view and different similarity views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

  Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model used in BMW Group production facilities.

  We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations and quantitative evaluations.

  Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

  Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems \emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator $\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be approximated only by learning.

  The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL) enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

  LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs, optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However, many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context, and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs. parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware execution in LLM serving pipelines.

  Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation (MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition.

  Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives: topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is available at:this https URL.

  We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025]. While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions (uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for uncountable collections.Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of boosting.Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li, Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in the growing area of language generation.

  Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration (FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters. This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

  Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally, the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises. Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical evaluation of various clustering tasks.

  DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect'' reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions, encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these advantages.

  Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Then, we reformulate an ordinal model with functional covariates to a classic ordinal model with multiple scalar covariates. We illustrate all the proposed methods and try to apply these to a dataset collected by EssilorLuxottica for the development of a control algorithm for the shade of connected glasses.

  In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression models adapted to the reinforcement learning setting. Our approach addresses practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the action space and applying the ordinal policy yields competitive performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control, with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal dynamics from population data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations. These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap, training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap, inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

  We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences, allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

  Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs. ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points, which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT (Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer), a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior. Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$ for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

  Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of 0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network, enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

  Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14% less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics, we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by better representing them in their logical formulations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE (3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE architectures. We make our models publicly available atthis https URLandthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models, or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks, yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency, particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed, which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability, that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research, leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG (ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs. By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable down-stream applications in causal discovery.

  Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$ sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32% trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA. Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for efficient foundation model adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data. The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved performance for the landmine detection problem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama, and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6 points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points across seven benchmarks.

  Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However, their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover, Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers. However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning, i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student, we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance.

  Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models' evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically, AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically, present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards addressing this challenge.

  Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance, particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across all tested datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs. However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane (LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over existing PEFT methods. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

  Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process, or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling. Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

  Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention, due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited practical value.

  _Yongchao Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM, including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static, frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed, uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However, efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers. At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to partial solutions.

  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning, Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and code are available atthis https URL.

  Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their ``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability. Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals. Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in alignment faking.

  _Lucas Mattioli, Youness Ait Hadichou, Sabrina Chaouche, Martin Gonzalez_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in out-of-distribution settings.

In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD, providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed learning systems.

  World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions, producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+ offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+ delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios. Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions. We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies: beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

  Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$ is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size. Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning in energy-constrained settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real, high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries: SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN, TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio. Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility, assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case. The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the 1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use, making it more accessible for practitioners.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse), and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

  _Xinnan Zhang, Chenliang Li, Siliang Zeng, Jiaxiang Li, Zhongruo Wang, Kaixiang Lin, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible. In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions, and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

  _Zhongtian Sun, Anoushka Harit, Pietro Lio_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity. Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics. Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT, PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

  _Lijun Zhang, Xiao Liu, Hui Guan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of this generative solution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings. Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or number of active parameters.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode (granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment. We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2% of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000 steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets, these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model. It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks enables synergistic learning.

  _Jiheng Liang, Ziru Yu, Zujie Xie, Yuchen Guo, Yulan Guo, Xiangyang Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context. These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes" supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts (PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial, field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207 batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time. Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50% average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into the sustainable energy landscape.

  _Seonglae Cho, Harryn Oh, Donghyun Lee, Luis Eduardo Rodrigues Vieira, Andrew Bermingham, Ziad El Sayed_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features. However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features, which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of SAE training datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution: the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction) extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved, which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by 1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on quality.

  _Furong Peng, Jinzhen Gao, Xuan Lu, Kang Liu, Yifan Huo, Sheng Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast, Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations, maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the model's expressive capacity.To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The code is available at [this https URL].

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible. In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed, considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views, and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained the best results.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management, personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context, combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

  _Steffen Schotth√∂fer, Timon Klein, Jonas Kusch_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape. To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs) approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks, using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on causes of highly and low interpretable features.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs), particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture, FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model. We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is 7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time efficiency.

  _Emma Finn, T. Anderson Keller, Manos Theodosis, Demba E. Ba_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce SafeRL-Lite, an open-source Python library for building reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are both constrained and explainable. Existing RL toolkits often lack native mechanisms for enforcing hard safety constraints or producing human-interpretable rationales for decisions. SafeRL-Lite provides modular wrappers around standard Gym environments and deep Q-learning agents to enable: (i) safety-aware training via constraint enforcement, and (ii) real-time post-hoc explanation via SHAP values and saliency maps. The library is lightweight, extensible, and installable via pip, and includes built-in metrics for constraint violations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on constrained variants of CartPole and provide visualizations that reveal both policy logic and safety adherence. The full codebase is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations, indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring reliable reasoning and interpretability.

  _Xianren Zhang, Hui Liu, Delvin Ce Zhang, Xianfeng Tang, Qi He, Dongwon Lee, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model. Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

  _Jikai Long, Zijian Hu, Xiaodong Yu, Jianwen Xie, Zhaozhuo Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO) offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order tuning regimes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma: how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic and continual learning settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these predictions.Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects: (1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124). Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains. Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each classification.Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions, contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive expansion with increasing disease severity.Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical region contributing to model predictions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights, importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity, alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii) solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to the optimum in practical settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm, simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of fixed preference datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

  _Fudong Lin, Jiadong Lou, Hao Wang, Brian Jalaian, Xu Yuan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels (i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength. In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition, theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e., "obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty, causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off between task performance and inference efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and (ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS) within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

  Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific domains.

Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer an effective framework to model heterogeneous and structured omics data, enabling precise representation of molecular interactions and regulatory networks. This systematic review explores several recent studies that leverage GNN-based architectures in multi-omics cancer research. We classify the approaches based on their targeted omics layers, graph neural network structures, and biological tasks such as subtype classification, prognosis prediction, and biomarker discovery. The analysis reveals a growing trend toward hybrid and interpretable models, alongside increasing adoption of attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. Furthermore, we highlight the use of patient-specific graphs and knowledge-driven priors as emerging directions. This survey serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers aiming to design effective GNN-based pipelines for integrative cancer analysis, offering insights into current practices, limitations, and potential future directions.

  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation: foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet, VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results, validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs. This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer (MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE) layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains.

  All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language. Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality. The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The error function is informal but still works for our case.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

  Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion, preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework. Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth (IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT), further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target LLM's capabilities.

  Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains. However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice and multi-slice scenarios.

- **[SCISSOR: Mitigating Semantic Bias through Cluster-Aware Siamese Networks for Robust Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14587)**  `arXiv:2506.14587`  
  _Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shortcut learning undermines model generalization to out-of-distribution data. While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP. Our study redefines the landscape of model generalization by addressing overlooked semantic biases, establishing SCISSOR as a foundational framework for mitigating shortcut learning and fostering more robust, bias-resistant AI systems.

  _Shen Yuan, Yin Zheng, Taifeng Wang, Binbin Liu, Hongteng Xu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adapting large-scale foundation models in multi-task scenarios often suffers from task conflict and oblivion. To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance.

  _Yiwei Chen, Soumyadeep Pal, Yimeng Zhang, Qing Qu, Sijia Liu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning rate is widely regarded as crucial for effective foundation model pretraining. Recent research explores and demonstrates the transferability of learning rate configurations across varying model and dataset sizes, etc. Nevertheless, these approaches are constrained to specific training scenarios and typically necessitate extensive hyperparameter tuning on proxy models. In this work, we propose \textbf{AdaLRS}, a plug-in-and-play adaptive learning rate search algorithm that conducts online optimal learning rate search via optimizing loss descent velocities. We provide experiment results to show that the optimization of training loss and loss descent velocity in foundation model pretraining are both convex and share the same optimal learning rate. Relying solely on training loss dynamics, AdaLRS involves few extra computations to guide the search process, and its convergence is guaranteed via theoretical analysis. Experiments on both LLM and VLM pretraining show that AdaLRS adjusts suboptimal learning rates to the neighborhood of optimum with marked efficiency and effectiveness, with model performance improved accordingly. We also show the robust generalizability of AdaLRS across varying training scenarios, such as different model sizes, training paradigms, and base learning rate scheduler choices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) accelerates training by eliminating the need to wait for stragglers, but its asynchronous nature introduces gradient staleness, where outdated gradients degrade performance. Existing solutions address this issue with gradient buffers, forming a semi-asynchronous framework. However, this approach struggles when buffers accumulate numerous stale gradients, as blindly aggregating all gradients can harm training. To address this, we propose AFBS (Asynchronous FL Buffer Selection), the first algorithm to perform gradient selection within buffers while ensuring privacy protection. Specifically, the client sends the random projection encrypted label distribution matrix before training, and the server performs client clustering based on it. During training, server scores and selects gradients within each cluster based on their informational value, discarding low-value gradients to enhance semi-asynchronous federated learning. Extensive experiments in highly heterogeneous system and data environments demonstrate AFBS's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on the most challenging task, CIFAR-100, AFBS improves accuracy by up to 4.8% over the previous best algorithm and reduces the time to reach target accuracy by 75%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models can retain dangerous knowledge and skills even after extensive safety fine-tuning, posing both misuse and misalignment risks. Recent studies show that even specialized unlearning methods can be easily reversed. To address this, we systematically evaluate many existing and novel components of unlearning methods and identify ones crucial for irreversible unlearning.We introduce Disruption Masking, a technique in which we only allow updating weights, where the signs of the unlearning gradient and the retaining gradient are the same. This ensures all updates are non-disruptive.Additionally, we identify the need for normalizing the unlearning gradients, and also confirm the usefulness of meta-learning. We combine these insights into MUDMAN (Meta-Unlearning with Disruption Masking and Normalization) and validate its effectiveness at preventing the recovery of dangerous capabilities. MUDMAN outperforms the prior TAR method by 40\%, setting a new state-of-the-art for robust unlearning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs, typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain. The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes. In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a neural network.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, structurally resembling bilinear systems. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Bilinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Bilinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and prolonged training durations. To address this challenge, we build upon prior work that introduced a neural architecture with permutation-invariant sensory processing. We propose a modified attention mechanism that applies a non-linear transformation to the key vectors (K), producing enriched representations (K') through a custom mapping function. This Nonlinear Attention (NLA) mechanism enhances the representational capacity of the attention layer, enabling the agent to learn more expressive feature interactions. As a result, our model achieves significantly faster convergence and improved training efficiency, while maintaining performance on par with the baseline. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear attention mechanisms to accelerate reinforcement learning without sacrificing effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled machine learning models to achieve significant advances in many fields. Most recently, RL has empowered frontier language models to solve challenging math, science, and coding problems. However, central to any RL algorithm is the reward function, and reward engineering is a notoriously difficult problem in any domain. In this paper, we propose RENT: Reinforcement Learning via Entropy Minimization -- a fully unsupervised RL method that requires no external reward or ground-truth answers, and instead uses the model's entropy of its underlying distribution as an intrinsic reward. We find that by reinforcing the chains of thought that yield high model confidence on its generated answers, the model improves its reasoning ability. In our experiments, we showcase these improvements on an extensive suite of commonly-used reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH500, AMC, AIME, and GPQA, and models of varying sizes from the Qwen and Mistral families. The generality of our unsupervised learning method lends itself to applicability in a wide range of domains where external supervision is unavailable.

  _Gianmarco Genalti, Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Matteo Castiglioni, Alberto Marchesi, Nicola Gatti_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper initiates the study of data-dependent regret bounds in constrained MAB settings. These bounds depend on the sequence of losses that characterize the problem instance. Thus, they can be much smaller than classical $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, while being equivalent to them in the worst case. Despite this, data-dependent regret bounds have been completely overlooked in constrained MAB settings. The goal of this paper is to answer the following question: Can data-dependent regret bounds be derived in the presence of constraints? We answer this question affirmatively in constrained MABs with adversarial losses and stochastic constraints. Specifically, our main focus is on the most challenging and natural settings with hard constraints, where the learner must ensure that the constraints are always satisfied with high probability. We design an algorithm with a regret bound consisting of two data-dependent terms. The first term captures the difficulty of satisfying the constraints, while the second one encodes the complexity of learning independently of the presence of constraints. We also prove a lower bound showing that these two terms are not artifacts of our specific approach and analysis, but rather the fundamental components that inherently characterize the complexities of the problem. Finally, in designing our algorithm, we also derive some novel results in the related (and easier) soft constraints settings, which may be of independent interest.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-rank representation learning has emerged as a powerful tool for recovering missing values in power load data due to its ability to exploit the inherent low-dimensional structures of spatiotemporal measurements. Among various techniques, low-rank factorization models are favoured for their efficiency and interpretability. However, their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of regularization parameters, which are typically fixed or manually tuned, resulting in limited generalization capability or slow convergence in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Regularization-optimized Low-Rank Factorization, which introduces a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to adaptively adjust the regularization coefficient. Furthermore, we provide a detailed algorithmic complexity analysis, showing that our method preserves the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent while improving adaptivity. Experimental results on real-world power load datasets validate the superiority of our method in both imputation accuracy and training efficiency compared to existing baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces ECHO-LLaMA, an efficient LLaMA architecture designed to improve both the training speed and inference throughput of LLaMA architectures while maintaining its learning capacity. ECHO-LLaMA transforms LLaMA models into shared KV caching across certain layers, significantly reducing KV computational complexity while maintaining or improving language performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO-LLaMA achieves up to 77\% higher token-per-second throughput during training, up to 16\% higher Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU), and up to 14\% lower loss when trained on an equal number of tokens. Furthermore, on the 1.1B model, ECHO-LLaMA delivers approximately 7\% higher test-time throughput compared to the baseline. By introducing a computationally efficient adaptation mechanism, ECHO-LLaMA offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for pretraining and finetuning large language models, enabling faster and more resource-efficient training without compromising performance.

  _Xuyang Chen, Keyu Yan, Lin Zhao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function. Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear margins on the more challenging tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Objective: To develop and evaluate a scalable methodology for harmonizing inconsistent units in large-scale clinical datasets, addressing a key barrier to data interoperability.Materials and Methods: We designed a novel unit harmonization system combining BM25, sentence embeddings, Bayesian optimization, and a bidirectional transformer based binary classifier for retrieving and matching laboratory test entries. The system was evaluated using the Optum Clinformatics Datamart dataset (7.5 billion entries). We implemented a multi-stage pipeline: filtering, identification, harmonization proposal generation, automated re-ranking, and manual validation. Performance was assessed using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and other standard information retrieval metrics.Results: Our hybrid retrieval approach combining BM25 and sentence embeddings (MRR: 0.8833) significantly outperformed both lexical-only (MRR: 0.7985) and embedding-only (MRR: 0.5277) approaches. The transformer-based reranker further improved performance (absolute MRR improvement: 0.10), bringing the final system MRR to 0.9833. The system achieved 83.39\% precision at rank 1 and 94.66\% recall at rank 5.Discussion: The hybrid architecture effectively leverages the complementary strengths of lexical and semantic approaches. The reranker addresses cases where initial retrieval components make errors due to complex semantic relationships in medical terminology.Conclusion: Our framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for unit harmonization in clinical datasets, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy. Once harmonized, data can be reused seamlessly in different analyses, ensuring consistency across healthcare systems and enabling more reliable multi-institutional studies and meta-analyses.

  Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards~(\textit{RLVR}). However, existing \textit{RLVR} approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{LUFFY} (\textbf{L}earning to reason \textbf{U}nder o\textbf{FF}-polic\textbf{Y} guidance), a framework that augments \textit{RLVR} with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Specifically, LUFFY combines the Mixed-Policy GRPO framework, which has a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate, alongside policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Compared with previous RLVR methods, LUFFY achieves an over \textbf{+6.4} average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over \textbf{+6.2} points in out-of-distribution tasks. Most significantly, we show that LUFFY successfully trains weak models in scenarios where on-policy RLVR completely fails. These results provide compelling evidence that LUFFY transcends the fundamental limitations of on-policy RLVR and demonstrates the great potential of utilizing off-policy guidance in RLVR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

  Understanding the relationship between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and driving behavior is essential for enhancing road safety, particularly among older adults. This study introduces a novel approach by incorporating specific trip destinations-such as home, work, medical appointments, social activities, and errands-using geohashing to analyze the driving habits of older drivers in Nebraska. We employed a two-fold methodology that combines data visualization with advanced machine learning models, including C5.0, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to assess the effectiveness of these location-based variables in predicting cognitive impairment. Notably, the C5.0 model showed a robust and stable performance, achieving a median recall of 0.68, which indicates that our methodology accurately identifies cognitive impairment in drivers 68\% of the time. This emphasizes our model's capacity to reduce false negatives, a crucial factor given the profound implications of failing to identify impaired drivers. Our findings underscore the innovative use of life-space variables in understanding and predicting cognitive decline, offering avenues for early intervention and tailored support for affected individuals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  At the current stage, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated excellent capabilities in evaluating aerodynamic performance, significantly reducing the time and cost required for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, when faced with the task of processing extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) vehicle models, the lack of large-scale datasets and training resources, coupled with the inherent diversity and complexity of the geometry of different vehicle models, means that the prediction accuracy and versatility of these networks are still not up to the level required for current production. In view of the remarkable success of Transformer models in the field of natural language processing and their strong potential in the field of image processing, this study innovatively proposes a point cloud learning framework called DrivAer Transformer (DAT). The DAT structure uses the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which contains high-fidelity CFD data of industrial-standard 3D vehicle shapes. enabling accurate estimation of air drag directly from 3D meshes, thus avoiding the limitations of traditional methods such as 2D image rendering or signed distance fields (SDF). DAT enables fast and accurate drag prediction, driving the evolution of the aerodynamic evaluation process and laying the critical foundation for introducing a data-driven approach to automotive design. The framework is expected to accelerate the vehicle design process and improve development efficiency.

  _Sumeyye Meryem Tasyurek, Tugce Kiziltepe, Hacer Yalim Keles_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from sentence-level text embeddings. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL-divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To apply reinforcement learning to safety-critical applications, we ought to provide safety guarantees during both policy training and deployment. In this work, we present theoretical results that place a bound on the probability of violating a safety property for a new task-specific policy in a model-free, episodic setting. This bound, based on a maximum policy ratio computed with respect to a 'safe' base policy, can also be applied to temporally-extended properties (beyond safety) and to robust control problems. To utilize these results, we introduce SPoRt, which provides a data-driven method for computing this bound for the base policy using the scenario approach, and includes Projected PPO, a new projection-based approach for training the task-specific policy while maintaining a user-specified bound on property violation. SPoRt thus enables users to trade off safety guarantees against task-specific performance. Complementing our theoretical results, we present experimental results demonstrating this trade-off and comparing the theoretical bound to posterior bounds derived from empirical violation rates.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Discrete Diffusion and Flow Matching models have significantly advanced generative modeling for discrete structures, including graphs. However, the dependencies between intermediate noisy states lead to error accumulation and propagation during the reverse denoising process - a phenomenon known as compounding denoising errors. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Simple Iterative Denoising, which simplifies discrete diffusion and circumvents the issue by assuming conditional independence between intermediate states. Additionally, we enhance our model by incorporating a Critic. During generation, the Critic selectively retains or corrupts elements in an instance based on their likelihood under the data distribution. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines in graph generation tasks.

  Model customization necessitates high-quality and diverse datasets, but acquiring such data remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. Despite the great potential of large language models (LLMs) for data synthesis, current approaches are constrained by limited seed data, model biases, and low-variation prompts, resulting in limited diversity and biased distributions with the increase of data scales. To tackle this challenge, we introduce TREESYNTH, a tree-guided subspace-based data synthesis approach inspired by decision trees. It constructs a spatial partitioning tree to recursively divide a task-specific full data space (i.e., root node) into numerous atomic subspaces (i.e., leaf nodes) with mutually exclusive and exhaustive attributes to ensure both distinctiveness and comprehensiveness before synthesizing samples within each atomic subspace. This globally dividing-and-synthesizing method finally collects subspace samples into a comprehensive dataset, effectively circumventing repetition and space collapse to ensure the diversity of large-scale data synthesis. Furthermore, the spatial partitioning tree enables sample allocation into atomic subspaces, allowing the rebalancing of existing datasets for more balanced and comprehensive distributions. Empirically, extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superior data diversity, model performance, and robust scalability of TREESYNTH compared to both human-crafted datasets and peer data synthesis methods, with an average performance gain reaching 10%. Besides, the consistent improvements of TREESYNTH-balanced datasets highlight its efficacious application to redistribute existing datasets for more comprehensive coverage and the induced performance enhancement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quality of probabilistic forecasts is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty. While proper scoring rules incentivize truthful reporting of precise forecasts, they fall short when forecasters face epistemic uncertainty about their beliefs, limiting their use in safety-critical domains where decision-makers (DMs) prioritize proper uncertainty management. To address this, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given as a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic scoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social choice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first share their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream decisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters resolve indecision during elicitation. We further show that truthful elicitation of imprecise forecasts is achievable using proper scoring rules randomized over the aggregation procedure. Our approach allows DM to elicit and integrate the forecaster's epistemic uncertainty into their decision-making process, thus improving credibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-horizon tasks in robotic manipulation present significant challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) due to the difficulty of designing dense reward functions and effectively exploring the expansive state-action space. However, despite a lack of dense rewards, these tasks often have a multi-stage structure, which can be leveraged to decompose the overall objective into manageable subgoals. In this work, we propose DEMO3, a framework that exploits this structure for efficient learning from visual inputs. Specifically, our approach incorporates multi-stage dense reward learning, a bi-phasic training scheme, and world model learning into a carefully designed demonstration-augmented RL framework that strongly mitigates the challenge of exploration in long-horizon tasks. Our evaluations demonstrate that our method improves data-efficiency by an average of 40% and by 70% on particularly difficult tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We validate this across 16 sparse-reward tasks spanning four domains, including challenging humanoid visual control tasks using as few as five demonstrations.

  We present the POPGym Arcade, a collection of hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments with shared observation and action spaces. Each environment includes fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. We also introduce mathematical tools for analyzing policies under partial observability, which reveal how agents recall past information to make decisions. Our analysis shows (1) that controlling for partial observability is critical and (2) that agents with long-term memory learn brittle policies that struggle to generalize. Finally, we demonstrate that recurrent policies can be "poisoned" by old, out-of-distribution observations, with implications for sim-to-real transfer, imitation learning, and offline reinforcement learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dyna-style off-policy model-based reinforcement learning (DMBRL) algorithms are a family of techniques for generating synthetic state transition data and thereby enhancing the sample efficiency of off-policy RL algorithms. This paper identifies and investigates a surprising performance gap observed when applying DMBRL algorithms across different benchmark environments with proprioceptive observations. We show that, while DMBRL algorithms perform well in OpenAI Gym, their performance can drop significantly in DeepMind Control Suite (DMC), even though these settings offer similar tasks and identical physics backends. Modern techniques designed to address several key issues that arise in these settings do not provide a consistent improvement across all environments, and overall our results show that adding synthetic rollouts to the training process -- the backbone of Dyna-style algorithms -- significantly degrades performance across most DMC environments. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of several fundamental challenges in model-based RL and show that, like many optimization fields, there is no free lunch when evaluating performance across diverse benchmarks in RL.

  _Atsushi Kudo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers around the world operate a variety of NWP models. In addition, recent advances in AI-driven NWP models have further increased the availability of NWP outputs. While this expansion holds the potential to improve forecast accuracy, it raises a critical question: which prediction is the most plausible? If the NWP models have comparable accuracy, it is impossible to determine in advance which one is the best. Traditional approaches, such as ensemble or weighted averaging, combine multiple NWP outputs to produce a single forecast with improved accuracy. However, they often result in meteorologically unrealistic and uninterpretable outputs, such as the splitting of tropical cyclone centers or frontal boundaries into multiple distinct systems.To address this issue, we propose DeepMedcast, a deep learning method that generates intermediate forecasts between two or more NWP outputs. Unlike averaging, DeepMedcast provides predictions in which meteorologically significant features -- such as the locations of tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, fronts, and shear lines -- approximately align with the arithmetic mean of the corresponding features predicted by the input NWP models, without distorting meteorological structures. We demonstrate the capability of DeepMedcast through case studies and verification results, showing that it produces realistic and interpretable forecasts with higher accuracy than the input NWP models. By providing plausible intermediate forecasts, DeepMedcast can significantly contribute to the efficiency and standardization of operational forecasting tasks, including general, marine, and aviation forecasts.

  _Viacheslav Surkov, Chris Wendler, Antonio Mari, Mikhail Terekhov, Justin Deschenaux, Robert West, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.

  Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.

  Ensemble methods are known for enhancing the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models by combining multiple base learners. However, standard approaches like greedy or random ensembling often fall short, as they assume a constant weight across samples for the ensemble members. This can limit expressiveness and hinder performance when aggregating the ensemble predictions. In this study, we explore employing regularized neural networks as ensemble methods, emphasizing the significance of dynamic ensembling to leverage diverse model predictions adaptively. Motivated by the risk of learning low-diversity ensembles, we propose regularizing the ensembling model by randomly dropping base model predictions during the training. We demonstrate this approach provides lower bounds for the diversity within the ensemble, reducing overfitting and improving generalization capabilities. Our experiments showcase that the regularized neural ensemblers yield competitive results compared to strong baselines across several modalities such as computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular data.

  We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill, a general-purpose fast generation method for any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. FutureFill reduces generation time from quadratic to quasilinear in the context length. Moreover, when generating from a prompt, it requires a prefill cache whose size grows only with the number of tokens to be generated, often much smaller than the caches required by standard convolutional or attention based models. We validate our theoretical claims with experiments on synthetic tasks and demonstrate substantial efficiency gains when generating from a deep convolutional sequence prediction model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental question in interpretability research is to what extent neural networks, particularly language models, implement reusable functions through subnetworks that can be composed to perform more complex tasks. Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have made progress in identifying $\textit{circuits}$, which represent the minimal computational subgraphs responsible for a model's behavior on specific tasks. However, most studies focus on identifying circuits for individual tasks without investigating how functionally similar circuits $\textit{relate}$ to each other. To address this gap, we study the modularity of neural networks by analyzing circuits for highly compositional subtasks within a transformer-based language model. Specifically, given a probabilistic context-free grammar, we identify and compare circuits responsible for ten modular string-edit operations. Our results indicate that functionally similar circuits exhibit both notable node overlap and cross-task faithfulness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circuits identified can be reused and combined through set operations to represent more complex functional model capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g., observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model as a principled mathematical framework for understanding the mechanism of MPNNs and navigating novel architectural designs. Inspired by physical systems, the model combines the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified perspective on common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLP, GCN, GIN, APPNP, GCNII, GAT, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers, whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets, ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a semantic-oriented PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a semantic-oriented decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.

  We introduce Smooth InfoMax (SIM), a self-supervised representation learning method that incorporates interpretability constraints into the latent representations at different depths of the network. Based on $\beta$-VAEs, SIM's architecture consists of probabilistic modules optimized locally with the InfoNCE loss to produce Gaussian-distributed representations regularized toward the standard normal distribution. This creates smooth, well-defined, and better-disentangled latent spaces, enabling easier post-hoc analysis. Evaluated on speech data, SIM preserves the large-scale training benefits of Greedy InfoMax while improving the effectiveness of post-hoc interpretability methods across layers.

  Early exits enable the network's forward pass to terminate early by attaching trainable internal classifiers to the backbone network. Existing early-exit methods typically adopt either a joint training approach, where the backbone and exit heads are trained simultaneously, or a disjoint approach, where the heads are trained separately. However, the implications of this choice are often overlooked, with studies typically adopting one approach without adequate justification. This choice influences training dynamics and its impact remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a set of metrics to analyze early-exit training dynamics and guide the choice of training strategy. We demonstrate that conventionally used joint and disjoint regimes yield suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a mixed training strategy: the backbone is trained first, followed by the training of the entire multi-exit network. Through comprehensive evaluations of training strategies across various architectures, datasets, and early-exit methods, we present the strengths and weaknesses of the early exit training strategies. In particular, we show consistent improvements in performance and efficiency using the proposed mixed strategy.

  Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse engineer the computation performed by a neural network in terms of its internal components. Although there is a growing body of research on mechanistic interpretation of neural networks, the notion of a mechanistic interpretation itself is often ad-hoc. Inspired by the notion of abstract interpretation from the program analysis literature that aims to develop approximate semantics for programs, we give a set of axioms that formally characterize a mechanistic interpretation as a description that approximately captures the semantics of the neural network under analysis in a compositional manner. We demonstrate the applicability of these axioms for validating mechanistic interpretations on an existing, well-known interpretability study as well as on a new case study involving a Transformer-based model trained to solve the well-known 2-SAT problem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In transformers, the positional encoding (PE) provides essential information that distinguishes the position and order amongst tokens in a sequence. Most prior investigations of PE effects on generalization were tailored to 1D input sequences, such as those presented in natural language, where adjacent tokens (e.g., words) are highly related. In contrast, many real world tasks involve datasets with highly non-trivial positional arrangements, such as datasets organized in multiple spatial dimensions, or datasets for which ground truth positions are not known. Here we find that the choice of initialization of a learnable PE greatly influences its ability to learn interpretable PEs that lead to enhanced generalization. We empirically demonstrate our findings in three experiments: 1) A 2D relational reasoning task; 2) A nonlinear stochastic network simulation; 3) A real world 3D neuroscience dataset, applying interpretability analyses to verify the learning of accurate PEs. Overall, we find that a learned PE initialized from a small-norm distribution can 1) uncover interpretable PEs that mirror ground truth positions in multiple dimensions, and 2) lead to improved generalization. These results illustrate the feasibility of learning identifiable and interpretable PEs for enhanced generalization.

  Resolving conflicts is critical for improving the reliability of multi-view classification. While prior work focuses on learning consistent and informative representations across views, it often assumes perfect alignment and equal importance of all views, an assumption rarely met in real-world scenarios, as some views may express distinct information. To address this, we develop a computational trust-based discounting method that enhances the Evidential Multi-view framework by accounting for the instance-wise reliability of each view through a probability-sensitive trust mechanism. We evaluate our method on six real-world datasets using Top-1 Accuracy, Fleiss' Kappa, and a new metric, Multi-View Agreement with Ground Truth, to assess prediction reliability. We also assess the effectiveness of uncertainty in indicating prediction correctness via AUROC. Additionally, we test the scalability of our method through end-to-end training on a large-scale dataset. The experimental results show that computational trust can effectively resolve conflicts, paving the way for more reliable multi-view classification models in real-world applications.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) training is inherently unstable due to factors such as moving targets and high gradient variance. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) can introduce additional difficulty. Differing preferences can complicate the alignment process, and prediction errors in a trained reward model can become more severe as the LLM generates unseen outputs. To enhance training robustness, RL has adopted techniques from supervised learning, such as ensembles and layer normalization. In this work, we improve the stability of RL training by adapting the reverse cross entropy (RCE) from supervised learning for noisy data to define a symmetric RL loss. We demonstrate performance improvements across various tasks and scales. We conduct experiments in discrete action tasks (Atari games) and continuous action space tasks (MuJoCo benchmark and Box2D) using Symmetric A2C (SA2C) and Symmetric PPO (SPPO), with and without added noise with especially notable performance in SPPO across different hyperparameters. Furthermore, we validate the benefits of the symmetric RL loss when using SPPO for large language models through improved performance in RLHF tasks, such as IMDB positive sentiment sentiment and TL;DR summarization tasks.

  Vision-language contrastive learning frameworks such as CLIP enable learning representations from natural language supervision and provide strong zero-shot classification capabilities. However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks such as segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different downstream vision tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples in the self-supervised learning path and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. Moreover, Harmony optimizes for five different objectives simultaneously, efficiently utilizing the supervision in each data example, making it even more suited in data-constrained settings. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and outperforms the previously leading joint self- and weakly supervised methods, SLIP, MaskCLIP, and DetailCLIP.

  Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a promising approach for managing task complexity across multiple levels of abstraction and accelerating long-horizon agent exploration. However, the effectiveness of hierarchical policies heavily depends on prior knowledge and manual assumptions about skill definitions and task decomposition. In this paper, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-based framework, namely SIDM, for hierarchical Decision Making in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. Central to our work is the utilization of structural information embedded in the decision-making process to adaptively and dynamically discover and learn hierarchical policies through environmental abstractions. Specifically, we present an abstraction mechanism that processes historical state-action trajectories to construct abstract representations of states and actions. We define and optimize directed structural entropy, a metric quantifying the uncertainty in transition dynamics between abstract states, to discover skills that capture key transition patterns in RL environments. Building on these findings, we develop a skill-based learning method for single-agent scenarios and a role-based collaboration method for multi-agent scenarios, both of which can flexibly integrate various underlying algorithms for enhanced performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and stability of policy learning by up to 32.70%, 64.86%, and 88.26%, respectively, as measured by average rewards, convergence timesteps, and standard deviations.

  When deploying time series forecasting models based on machine learning to real world settings, one often encounter situations where the data distribution drifts. Such drifts expose the forecasting models to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and machine learning models lack robustness in these settings. Robustness can be improved by using deep generative models or genetic algorithms to augment time series datasets, but these approaches lack interpretability and are computationally expensive. In this work, we develop an interpretable and simple framework for generating time series. Our method combines time-series decompositions with analytic functions, and is able to generate time series with characteristics matching both in- and out-of-distribution data. This approach allows users to generate new time series in an interpretable fashion, which can be used to augment the dataset and improve forecasting robustness. We demonstrate our framework through EXPRTS, a visual analytics tool designed for univariate time series forecasting models and datasets. Different visualizations of the data distribution, forecasting errors and single time series instances enable users to explore time series datasets, apply transformations, and evaluate forecasting model robustness across diverse scenarios. We show how our framework can generate meaningful OOD time series that improve model robustness, and we validate EXPRTS effectiveness and usability through three use-cases and a user study.

  Machine learning has achieved remarkable success in many applications. However, existing studies are largely based on the closed-world assumption, which assumes that the environment is stationary, and the model is fixed once deployed. In many real-world applications, this fundamental and rather naive assumption may not hold because an open environment is complex, dynamic, and full of unknowns. In such cases, rejecting unknowns, discovering novelties, and then continually learning them, could enable models to be safe and evolve continually as biological systems do. This article presents a holistic view of open-world machine learning by investigating unknown rejection, novelty discovery, and continual learning in a unified paradigm. The challenges, principles, and limitations of current methodologies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, widely used benchmarks, metrics, and performances are summarized. Finally, we discuss several potential directions for further progress in the field. By providing a comprehensive introduction to the emerging open-world machine learning paradigm, this article aims to help researchers build more powerful AI systems in their respective fields, and to promote the development of artificial general intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Concept-based explainability methods use human-understandable intermediaries to produce explanations for machine learning models. These methods assume concept predictions can help understand a model's internal reasoning. In this work, we assess the degree to which such an assumption is true by analyzing whether concept predictors leverage ``relevant'' features to make predictions, a term we call locality. Concept-based models that fail to respect localities also fail to be explainable because concept predictions are based on spurious features, making the interpretation of the concept predictions vacuous. To assess whether concept-based models respect localities, we construct and use three metrics to characterize when models respect localities, complementing our analysis with theoretical results. Each of our metrics captures a different notion of perturbation and assess whether perturbing ``irrelevant'' features impacts the predictions made by a concept predictors. We find that many concept-based models used in practice fail to respect localities because concept predictors cannot always clearly distinguish distinct concepts. Based on these findings, we propose suggestions for alleviating this issue.

  We present a novel extension to the family of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms. We argue that based on the Maximum Entropy Principle, discrete SAC can be further improved via additional statistical constraints derived from a surrogate critic policy. Furthermore, our findings suggests that these constraints provide an added robustness against potential domain shifts, which are essential for safe deployment of reinforcement learning agents in the real-world. We provide theoretical analysis and show empirical results on low data regimes for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution variants of Atari 2600 games.

  The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes Advective Diffusion Transformer (AdvDIFFormer), a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models, i.e., the generalized formulation of common graph neural networks in continuous space. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active Learning (AL) addresses the crucial challenge of enabling machines to efficiently gather labeled examples through strategic queries. Among the many AL strategies, Uncertainty Sampling (US) stands out as one of the most widely adopted. US queries the example(s) that the current model finds uncertain, proving to be both straightforward and effective. Despite claims in the literature suggesting superior alternatives to US, community-wide acceptance remains elusive. In fact, existing benchmarks for tabular datasets present conflicting conclusions on the continued competitiveness of US. In this study, we review the literature on AL strategies in the last decade and build the most comprehensive open-source AL benchmark to date to understand the relative merits of different AL strategies. The benchmark surpasses existing ones by encompassing a broader coverage of strategies, models, and data. Through our investigation of the conflicting conclusions in existing tabular AL benchmarks by evaluation under broad AL experimental settings, we uncover fresh insights into the often-overlooked issue of using machine learning models--**model compatibility** in the context of US. Specifically, we notice that adopting the different models for the querying unlabeled examples and learning tasks would degrade US's effectiveness. Notably, our findings affirm that US maintains a competitive edge over other strategies when paired with compatible models. These findings have practical implications and provide a concrete recipe for AL practitioners, empowering them to make informed decisions when working with tabular classifications with limited labeled data.

  _Nils Palumbo, Yang Guo, Xi Wu, Jiefeng Chen, Yingyu Liang, Somesh Jha_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Both transduction and rejection have emerged as important techniques for defending against adversarial perturbations. A recent work by Goldwasser et al. showed that rejection combined with transduction can give provable guarantees (for certain problems) that cannot be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, under recent strong adversarial attacks, their work was shown to have low performance in a practical deep-learning setting. In this paper, we take a step towards realizing the promise of transduction+rejection in more realistic scenarios. Our key observation is that a novel application of a reduction technique by Tram√®r, which was until now only used to demonstrate the vulnerability of certain defenses, can be used to actually construct effective defenses. Theoretically, we show that a careful application of this technique in the transductive setting can give significantly improved sample-complexity for robust generalization. Our theory guides us to design a new transductive algorithm for learning a selective model; extensive experiments using state of the art attacks show that our approach provides significantly better robust accuracy (81.6% on CIFAR-10 and 57.9% on CIFAR-100 under $l_\infty$ with budget 8/255) than existing techniques.

  Artificial intelligence is more ubiquitous in multiple domains. Smartphones, social media platforms, search engines, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of applications that utilize artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their performance. This study carries out a scoping review of the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in different domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three recognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning domain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were observed. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the technology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or otherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must show improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts of the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the data gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured, and the technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum manual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating labeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or semi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The learning algorithms should be able to be updated efficiently, and predictions should be interpretable. Using artificial intelligence technologies in real-world applications, safety and explainable predictions are mandatory to consider before mass adoption can occur.

  Accurate time series forecasting is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, industrial production, and urban management, particularly with the growth of cyber-physical and IoT systems. However, limited training sample availability in fields like physics and biology poses significant challenges. Existing models struggle to capture long-term dependencies and to model diverse meta-knowledge explicitly in few-shot scenarios. To address these issues, we propose MetaGP, a meta-learning-based Gaussian process latent variable model that uses a Gaussian process kernel function to capture long-term dependencies and to maintain strong correlations in time series. We also introduce Kernel Association Search (KAS) as a novel meta-learning component to explicitly model meta-knowledge, thereby enhancing both interpretability and prediction accuracy. We study MetaGP on simulated and real-world few-shot datasets, showing that it is capable of state-of-the-art prediction accuracy. We also find that MetaGP can capture long-term dependencies and can model meta-knowledge, thereby providing valuable insights into complex time series patterns.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a vital role in monitoring and data collection in wide area environments with harsh conditions. In most scenarios, issues such as real-time data retrieval and real-time UAV positioning are often disregarded, essentially neglecting the communication constraints. In this paper, we comprehensively address both the coverage of the target area and the data transmission capabilities of the flying ad hoc network (FANET). The data throughput of the network is therefore maximized by optimizing the network topology and the UAV trajectories. The resultant optimization problem is effectively solved by the proposed reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning (RL-TP) algorithm and the convex-based topology optimization (C-TOP) algorithm sequentially. The RL-TP optimizes the UAV paths while considering the constraints of FANET. The C-TOP maximizes the data throughput of the network while simultaneously constraining the neighbors and transmit powers of the UAVs, which is shown to be a convex problem that can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Simulations and field experimental results show that the proposed optimization strategy can effectively plan the UAV trajectories and significantly improve the data throughput of the FANET over the adaptive local minimum spanning tree (A-LMST) and cyclic pruning-assisted power optimization (CPAPO) methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates. Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark, enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-, three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an ``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and ``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation. However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.

  3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

  Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images. Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning (IL), particularly when leveraging high-dimensional visual inputs for policy training, has proven intuitive and effective in complex bimanual manipulation tasks. Nonetheless, the generalization capability of visuomotor policies remains limited, especially when small demonstration datasets are available. Accumulated errors in visuomotor policies significantly hinder their ability to complete long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SViP, a framework that seamlessly integrates visuomotor policies into task and motion planning (TAMP). SViP partitions human demonstrations into bimanual and unimanual operations using a semantic scene graph monitor. Continuous decision variables from the key scene graph are employed to train a switching condition generator. This generator produces parameterized scripted primitives that ensure reliable performance even when encountering out-of-the-distribution observations. Using only 20 real-world demonstrations, we show that SViP enables visuomotor policies to generalize across out-of-distribution initial conditions without requiring object pose estimators. For previously unseen tasks, SViP automatically discovers effective solutions to achieve the goal, leveraging constraint modeling in TAMP formulism. In real-world experiments, SViP outperforms state-of-the-art generative IL methods, indicating wider applicability for more complex tasks. Project website:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles, into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs), the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures, restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet) to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models, grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deformable object manipulation is critical to many real-world robotic applications, ranging from surgical robotics and soft material handling in manufacturing to household tasks like laundry folding. At the core of this important robotic field is shape servoing, a task focused on controlling deformable objects into desired shapes. The shape servoing formulation requires the specification of a goal shape. However, most prior works in shape servoing rely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious domain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously posed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns deformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human demonstrations. However, it significantly struggles in multi-modal settings, where multiple distinct goal shapes can all lead to successful task completion. As a deterministic model, DefGoalNet collapses these possibilities into a single averaged solution, often resulting in an unusable goal. In this paper, we address this problem by developing DefFusionNet, a novel neural network that leverages the diffusion probabilistic model to learn a distribution over all valid goal shapes rather than predicting a single deterministic outcome. This enables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging artifacts. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on robotic tasks inspired by both manufacturing and surgical applications, both in simulation and on a physical robot. Our work is the first generative model capable of producing a diverse, multi-modal set of deformable object goals for real-world robotic applications.

  _Marios-Nektarios Stamatopoulos, Shridhar Velhal, Avijit Banerjee, George Nikolakopoulos_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety. The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation. The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety during the construction process.

  _Alessandro Saviolo, Giuseppe Loianno_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions. We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full 6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame. To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

  _Nikhil Khedekar, Kostas Alexis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is widely used for accurate state estimation and mapping which is an essential requirement for autonomous robots. Conventional LIO methods typically rely on formulating constraints from the geometric structure sampled by the LiDAR. Hence, in the lack of geometric structure, these tend to become ill-conditioned (degenerate) and fail. Robustness of LIO to such conditions is a necessity for its broader deployment. To address this, we propose PG-LIO, a real-time LIO method that fuses photometric and geometric information sampled by the LiDAR along with inertial constraints from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This multi-modal information is integrated into a factor graph optimized over a sliding window for real-time operation. We evaluate PG-LIO on multiple datasets that include both geometrically well-conditioned as well as self-similar scenarios. Our method achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art LIO in geometrically well-structured settings while significantly improving accuracy in degenerate cases including against methods that also fuse intensity. Notably, we demonstrate only 1 m drift over a 1 km manually piloted aerial trajectory through a geometrically self-similar tunnel at an average speed of 7.5m/s (max speed 10.8 m/s). For the benefit of the community, we shall also release our source codethis https URL

  _Jan Michalczyk, Stephan Weiss, Jan Steinbrener_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality, state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks, and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the various challenges of open-ended learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language-driven grasp detection has the potential to revolutionize human-robot interaction by allowing robots to understand and execute grasping tasks based on natural language commands. However, existing approaches face two key challenges. First, they often struggle to interpret complex text instructions or operate ineffectively in densely cluttered environments. Second, most methods require a training or finetuning step to adapt to new domains, limiting their generation in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce GraspMAS, a new multi-agent system framework for language-driven grasp detection. GraspMAS is designed to reason through ambiguities and improve decision-making in real-world scenarios. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: Planner, responsible for strategizing complex queries; Coder, which generates and executes source code; and Observer, which evaluates the outcomes and provides feedback. Intensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our GraspMAS significantly outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, robot experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise and flexible cart-pushing is a challenging task for mobile robots. The motion constraints during cart-pushing and the robot's redundancy lead to complex motion planning problems, while variable payloads and disturbances present complicated dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel planning and control framework for flexible whole-body coordination and robust adaptive control. Our motion planning method employs a local coordinate representation and a novel kinematic model to solve a nonlinear optimization problem, thereby enhancing motion maneuverability by generating feasible and flexible push poses. Furthermore, we present a disturbance rejection control method to resist disturbances and reduce control errors for the complex control problem without requiring an accurate dynamic model. We validate our method through extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate the flexibility and robustness of cart-pushing methods in experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.

  The increasing demand for underwater exploration and rescue operations enforces the development of advanced wireless or semi-wireless underwater vessels equipped with manipulator arms. This paper presents the implementation of a semi-wireless underwater vehicle, "TritonZ" equipped with a manipulator arm, tailored for effective underwater exploration and rescue operations. The vehicle's compact design enables deployment in different submarine surroundings, addressing the need for wireless systems capable of navigating challenging underwater terrains. The manipulator arm can interact with the environment, allowing the robot to perform sophisticated tasks during exploration and rescue missions in emergency situations. TritonZ is equipped with various sensors such as Pi-Camera, Humidity, and Temperature sensors to send real-time environmental data. Our underwater vehicle controlled using a customized remote controller can navigate efficiently in the water where Pi-Camera enables live streaming of the surroundings. Motion control and video capture are performed simultaneously using this camera. The manipulator arm is designed to perform various tasks, similar to grasping, manipulating, and collecting underwater objects. Experimental results shows the efficacy of the proposed remotely operated vehicle in performing a variety of underwater exploration and rescue tasks. Additionally, the results show that TritonZ can maintain an average of 13.5cm/s with a minimal delay of 2-3 seconds. Furthermore, the vehicle can sustain waves underwater by maintaining its position as well as average velocity. The full project details and source code can be accessed at this link:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise sensor calibration is critical for autonomous vehicles as a prerequisite for perception algorithms to function properly. Rotation error of one degree can translate to position error of meters in target object detection at large distance, leading to improper reaction of the system or even safety related issues. Many methods for multi-sensor calibration have been proposed. However, there are very few work that comprehensively consider the challenges of the calibration procedure when applied to factory manufacturing pipeline or after-sales service scenarios. In this work, we introduce a fully automatic LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm based on targets that is fast, easy to deploy and robust to sensor noises such as missing data. The core of the method include: (1) an automatic multi-stage LiDAR board detection pipeline using only geometry information with no specific material requirement; (2) a fast coarse extrinsic parameter search mechanism that is robust to initial extrinsic errors; (3) a direct optimization algorithm that is robust to sensor noises. We validate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on data captured in real world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous tracking of flying aerial objects has important civilian and defense applications, ranging from search and rescue to counter-unmanned aerial systems (counter-UAS). Ground based tracking requires setting up infrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote areas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active tracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with serving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV entails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate (target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver decisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future time-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to the first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep learning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to achieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy, unlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception framework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to obviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting effectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of velocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are developed for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using AirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex target maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of tracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during tracking.

  With the development of robot electronic skin technology, various tactile sensors, enhanced by AI, are unlocking a new dimension of perception for robots. In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches, which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.

  In this paper we introduce Haptic-ACT, an advanced robotic system for pseudo oocyte manipulation, integrating multimodal information and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). Traditional automation methods for oocyte transfer rely heavily on visual perception, often requiring human supervision due to biological variability and environmental disturbances. Haptic-ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that Haptic-ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning in robotics for biomedical automation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-robot systems are emerging as a promising solution to the growing demand for productivity, safety, and adaptability across industrial sectors. However, effectively coordinating multiple robots in dynamic and uncertain environments, such as construction sites, remains a challenge, particularly due to unpredictable factors like material delays, unexpected site conditions, and weather-induced disruptions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an adaptive task allocation framework that strategically leverages the synergistic potential of Digital Twins, Integer Programming (IP), and Large Language Models (LLMs). The multi-robot task allocation problem is formally defined and solved using an IP model that accounts for task dependencies, robot heterogeneity, scheduling constraints, and re-planning requirements. A mechanism for narrative-driven schedule adaptation is introduced, in which unstructured natural language inputs are interpreted by an LLM, and optimization constraints are autonomously updated, enabling human-in-the-loop flexibility without manual coding. A digital twin-based system has been developed to enable real-time synchronization between physical operations and their digital representations. This closed-loop feedback framework ensures that the system remains dynamic and responsive to ongoing changes on site. A case study demonstrates both the computational efficiency of the optimization algorithm and the reasoning performance of several LLMs, with top-performing models achieving over 97% accuracy in constraint and parameter extraction. The results confirm the practicality, adaptability, and cross-domain applicability of the proposed methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The automation of composite sheet layup is essential to meet the increasing demand for composite materials in various industries. However, draping plans for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition. Changes in operating conditions due to either changes in material properties or working environment may lead a draping plan to exhibit suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite manufacturing automation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

  Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) stand out for their superior performance due to their high-information content output. Recently, marker-based VBTSs have been shown to give accurate geometry reconstruction when using stereo cameras. \uhl{However, many marker-based VBTSs use complex biomimetic skin-marker arrangements, which presents issues for the geometric reconstruction of the skin surface from the markers}. Here we investigate how the marker-based skin morphology affects stereo vision-based tactile sensing, using a novel VBTS called the StereoTacTip. To achieve accurate geometry reconstruction, we introduce: (i) stereo marker matching and tracking using a novel Delaunay-Triangulation-Ring-Coding algorithm; (ii) a refractive depth correction model that corrects the depth distortion caused by refraction in the internal media; (iii) a skin surface correction model from the marker positions, relying on an inverse calculation of normals to the skin surface; and (iv)~methods for geometry reconstruction over multiple contacts. To demonstrate these findings, we reconstruct topographic terrains on a large 3D map. Even though contributions (i) and (ii) were developed for biomimetic markers, they should improve the performance of all marker-based VBTSs. Overall, this work illustrates that a thorough understanding and evaluation of the morphologically-complex skin and marker-based tactile sensor principles are crucial for obtaining accurate geometric information.

  LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields, including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However, existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available datasets and achieved outstanding results.

  Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

  Reliable navigation in unstructured, real-world environments remains a significant challenge for embodied agents, especially when operating across diverse terrains, weather conditions, and sensor configurations. In this paper, we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment. GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2 with a novel path fusion strategy that enhances planning stability in noisy and ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.

  Continuum robots have been widely adopted in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) because of their compact size and high flexibility. However, their proprioceptive capabilities remain limited, particularly in narrow lumens, where lack of environmental awareness can lead to unintended tissue contact and surgical risks. To address this challenge, this work proposes a flexible annular sensor structure integrated around the vertebral disks of continuum robots. The proposed design enables real-time environmental mapping by estimating the distance between the robotic disks and the surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating safer operation through advanced control strategies. The experiment has proven that its accuracy in obstacle detection can reach 0.19 mm. Fabricated using flexible printed circuit (FPC) technology, the sensor demonstrates a modular and cost-effective design with compact dimensions and low noise interference. Its adaptable parameters allow compatibility with various continuum robot architectures, offering a promising solution for enhancing intraoperative perception and control in surgical robotics.

  Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to pick up certain tools and objects.

  Many researchers are working to address the worldwide mental health crisis by developing therapeutic technologies that increase the accessibility of care, including leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities in chatbots and socially assistive robots (SARs) used for therapeutic applications. Yet, the effects of these technologies over time remain unexplored. In this study, we use a factorial design to assess the impact of embodiment and time spent engaging in therapeutic exercises on participant disclosures. We assessed transcripts gathered from a two-week study in which 26 university student participants completed daily interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) exercises in their residences using either an LLM-powered SAR or a disembodied chatbot. We evaluated the levels of active engagement and high intimacy of their disclosures (opinions, judgments, and emotions) during each session and over time. Our findings show significant interactions between time and embodiment for both outcome measures: participant engagement and intimacy increased over time in the physical robot condition, while both measures decreased in the chatbot condition.

  Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap, often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may be beneficial to the marine robotics community.

  Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL, and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines, demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs. Project website:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most prior research in deep imitation learning has predominantly utilized fixed cameras for image input, which constrains task performance to the predefined field of view. However, enabling a robot to actively maneuver its neck can significantly expand the scope of imitation learning to encompass a wider variety of tasks and expressive actions such as neck gestures. To facilitate imitation learning in robots capable of neck movement while simultaneously performing object manipulation, we propose a teaching system that systematically collects datasets incorporating neck movements while minimizing discomfort caused by dynamic viewpoints during teleoperation. In addition, we present a novel network model for learning manipulation tasks including active neck motion. Experimental results showed that our model can achieve a high success rate of around 90\%, regardless of the distraction from the viewpoint variations by active neck motion. Moreover, the proposed model proved particularly effective in challenging scenarios, such as when objects were situated at the periphery or beyond the standard field of view, where traditional models struggled. The proposed approach contributes to the efficiency of dataset collection and extends the applicability of imitation learning to more complex and dynamic scenarios.

  Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets, but offer limited safety guarantees. Inspired by human cognitive science, we propose a risk-guided diffusion framework that fuses a fast, learned "System-1" with a slow, physics-based "System-2", sharing computation at both training and inference to couple adaptability with formal safety. Hardware experiments conducted at the NASA JPL's Mars-analog facility, Mars Yard, show that our approach reduces failure rates by up to $4\times$ while matching the goal-reaching performance of learning-based robotic models by leveraging inference-time compute without any additional training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces, annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

  Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models, and datasets atthis https URL.

  _Shuyuan Wang, Philip D. Loewen, Michael Forbes, Bhushan Gopaluni, Wei Pan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While differentiable control has emerged as a powerful paradigm combining model-free flexibility with model-based efficiency, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) remains underexplored as a differentiable component. The scalability of differentiating through extended iterations and horizons poses significant challenges, hindering iLQR from being an effective differentiable controller. This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that facilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable and differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect of this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient of an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a constant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate gradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control benchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational performance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared to automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning performance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and better model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical gradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with visual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional, fully end-to-end tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed input representations, or pre-existing maps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation in space is essential for emerging applications such as debris removal and in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (ISAM). A key requirement for these tasks is the ability to perform precise, contact-rich manipulation under significant uncertainty. In particular, thermal-induced deformation of manipulator links and temperature-dependent encoder bias introduce kinematic parameter errors that significantly degrade end-effector accuracy. Traditional calibration techniques rely on external sensors or dedicated calibration procedures, which can be infeasible or risky in dynamic, space-based operational scenarios.This paper proposes a novel method for kinematic parameter estimation that only requires encoder measurements and binary contact detection. The approach focuses on estimating link thermal deformation strain and joint encoder biases by leveraging information of the contact manifold - the set of relative SE(3) poses at which contact between the manipulator and environment occurs. We present two core contributions: (1) a differentiable, learning-based model of the contact manifold, and (2) an optimization-based algorithm for estimating kinematic parameters from encoder measurements at contact instances. By enabling parameter estimation using only encoder measurements and contact detection, this method provides a robust, interpretable, and data-efficient solution for safe and accurate manipulation in the challenging conditions of space.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR datasets to support autonomous vehicle perception, robotics research, and sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery. The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies. Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling, and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions, such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile, reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous systems. Documentation and examples accompany this framework; samples of animated cloud returns and image sensor data can be found at this Link.

  Desktop cleaning demands open-vocabulary recognition and precise manipulation for heterogeneous debris. We propose a hierarchical framework integrating reflective Vision-Language Model (VLM) planning with dual-arm execution via structured scene representation. Grounded-SAM2 facilitates open-vocabulary detection, while a memory-augmented VLM generates, critiques, and revises manipulation sequences. These sequences are converted into parametric trajectories for five primitives executed by coordinated Franka arms. Evaluated in simulated scenarios, our system achieving 87.2% task completion, a 28.8% improvement over static VLM and 36.2% over single-arm baselines. Structured memory integration proves crucial for robust, generalizable manipulation while maintaining real-time control performance.

  Throwing is a fundamental skill that enables robots to manipulate objects in ways that extend beyond the reach of their arms. We present a control framework that combines learning and model-based control for prehensile whole-body throwing with legged mobile manipulators. Our framework consists of three components: a nominal tracking policy for the end-effector, a high-frequency residual policy to enhance tracking accuracy, and an optimization-based module to improve end-effector acceleration control. The proposed controller achieved the average of 0.28 m landing error when throwing at targets located 6 m away. Furthermore, in a comparative study with university students, the system achieved a velocity tracking error of 0.398 m/s and a success rate of 56.8%, hitting small targets randomly placed at distances of 3-5 m while throwing at a specified speed of 6 m/s. In contrast, humans have a success rate of only 15.2%. This work provides an early demonstration of prehensile throwing with quantified accuracy on hardware, contributing to progress in dynamic whole-body manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate action inference is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a Vision-to-4D-to-Action (V-4D-A) framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state. To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and strong zero-shot generalization in real world.

  Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific standpoint. The technological contribution includes the mechanical design of iRonCub-Mk1, a jet-powered humanoid robot, optimized for jet engine integration, and hardware modifications for wind tunnel experiments on humanoid robots for precise aerodynamic forces and surface pressure measurements. The scientific contribution offers a comprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces using classical and learning techniques. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations calculate aerodynamic forces, validated through wind tunnel experiments on iRonCub-Mk1. An automated CFD framework expands the aerodynamic dataset, enabling the training of a Deep Neural Network and a linear regression model. These models are integrated into a simulator for designing aerodynamic-aware controllers, validated through flight simulations and balancing experiments on the iRonCub-Mk1 physical prototype.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a novel method of coverage path planning for the purpose of scanning an unstructured environment autonomously. The method uses the morphological skeleton of the prior 2D navigation map via SLAM to generate a sequence of points of interest (POIs). This sequence is then ordered to create an optimal path given the robot's current position. To control the high-level operation, a finite state machine is used to switch between two modes: navigating towards a POI using Nav2, and scanning the local surrounding. We validate the method in a leveled indoor obstacle-free non-convex environment on time efficiency and reachability over five trials. The map reader and the path planner can quickly process maps of width and height ranging between [196,225] pixels and [185,231] pixels in 2.52 ms/pixel and 1.7 ms/pixel, respectively, where their computation time increases with 22.0 ns/pixel and 8.17 $\mu$s/pixel, respectively. The robot managed to reach 86.5% of all waypoints over all five runs. The proposed method suffers from drift occurring in the 2D navigation map.

  The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments necessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during robotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoder model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting human behavior in shared environments is crucial for safe and efficient human-robot interaction. Traditional data-driven methods to that end are pre-trained on domain-specific datasets, activity types, and prediction horizons. In contrast, the recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise open-ended cross-domain generalization to describe various human activities and make predictions in any context. In particular, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are able to integrate information from various sources, achieving more contextual awareness and improved scene understanding. The difficulty in applying general-purpose MLLMs directly for prediction stems from their limited capacity for processing large input sequences, sensitivity to prompt design, and expensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of applying pre-trained MLLMs for context-aware human behavior prediction. To this end, we introduce a modular multimodal human activity prediction framework that allows us to benchmark various MLLMs, input variations, In-Context Learning (ICL), and autoregressive techniques. Our evaluation indicates that the best-performing framework configuration is able to reach 92.8% semantic similarity and 66.1% exact label accuracy in predicting human behaviors in the target frame.

  Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.

  As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Grip surfaces with tunable friction can actively modify contact conditions, enabling transitions between higher- and lower-friction states for grasp adjustment. Friction can be increased to grip securely and then decreased to gently release (e.g., for handovers) or manipulate in-hand. Recent friction-tuning surface designs using soft pneumatic chambers show good control over grip friction; however, most require complex fabrication processes and/or custom gripper hardware. We present a practical structured fingerpad design for friction tuning that uses less than $1 USD of materials, takes only seconds to repair, and is easily adapted to existing grippers. Our design uses surface morphology changes to tune friction. The fingerpad is actuated by pressurizing its internal chambers, thereby deflecting its flexible grip surface out from or into these chambers. We characterize the friction-tuning capabilities of our design by measuring the shear force required to pull an object from a gripper equipped with two independently actuated fingerpads. Our results show that varying actuation pressure and timing changes the magnitude of friction forces on a gripped object by up to a factor of 2.8. We demonstrate additional features including macro-scale interlocking behaviour and pressure-based object detection.

  Legged robots must adapt their gait to navigate unpredictable environments, a challenge that animals master with ease. However, most deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches to quadruped locomotion rely on a fixed gait, limiting adaptability to changes in terrain and dynamic state. Here we show that integrating three core principles of animal locomotion-gait transition strategies, gait memory and real-time motion adjustments enables a DRL control framework to fluidly switch among multiple gaits and recover from instability, all without external sensing. Our framework is guided by biomechanics-inspired metrics that capture efficiency, stability and system limits, which are unified to inform optimal gait selection. The resulting framework achieves blind zero-shot deployment across diverse, real-world terrains and substantially significantly outperforms baseline controllers. By embedding biological principles into data-driven control, this work marks a step towards robust, efficient and versatile robotic locomotion, highlighting how animal motor intelligence can shape the next generation of adaptive machines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown its remarkable and generalizable capability in legged locomotion through sim-to-real transfer. However, while adaptive methods like domain randomization are expected to enhance policy robustness across diverse environments, they potentially compromise the policy's performance in any specific environment, leading to suboptimal real-world deployment due to the No Free Lunch theorem. To address this, we propose LoopSR, a lifelong policy adaptation framework that continuously refines RL policies in the post-deployment stage. LoopSR employs a transformer-based encoder to map real-world trajectories into a latent space and reconstruct a digital twin of the real world for further improvement. Autoencoder architecture and contrastive learning methods are adopted to enhance feature extraction of real-world dynamics. Simulation parameters for continual training are derived by combining predicted values from the decoder with retrieved parameters from a pre-collected simulation trajectory dataset. By leveraging simulated continual training, LoopSR achieves superior data efficiency compared with strong baselines, yielding eminent performance with limited data in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real experiments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legged robots have become capable of performing highly dynamic maneuvers in the past few years. However, agile locomotion in highly constrained environments such as stepping stones is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a combination of model-based control, search, and learning to design efficient control policies for agile locomotion on stepping stones. In our framework, we use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to generate whole-body motions for a given contact plan. To efficiently search for an optimal contact plan, we propose to use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). While the combination of MCTS and NMPC can quickly find a feasible plan for a given environment (a few seconds), it is not yet suitable to be used as a reactive policy. Hence, we generate a dataset for optimal goal-conditioned policy for a given scene and learn it through supervised learning. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models in handling multi-modality in the dataset. We test our proposed framework on a scenario where our quadruped robot Solo12 successfully jumps to different goals in a highly constrained environment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a fast and accurate model of a deformable linear object (DLO) -- e.g., a rope, wire, or cable -- integrated into an established robot physics simulator, MuJoCo. Most accurate DLO models with low computational times exist in standalone numerical simulators, which are unable or require tedious work to handle external objects. Based on an existing state-of-the-art DLO model -- Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) -- our implementation provides an improvement in accuracy over MuJoCo's own native cable model. To minimize computational load, our model utilizes force-lever analysis to adapt the Cartesian stiffness forces of the DER into its generalized coordinates. As a key contribution, we introduce a novel parameter identification pipeline designed for both simplicity and accuracy, which we utilize to determine the bending and twisting stiffness of three distinct DLOs. We then evaluate the performance of each model by simulating the DLOs and comparing them to their real-world counterparts and against theoretically proven validation tests.
