  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

- **[AbstentionBench: Reasoning LLMs Fail on Unanswerable Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09038)**  `arXiv:2506.09038`  
  _Polina Kirichenko, Mark Ibrahim, Kamalika Chaudhuri, Samuel J. Bell_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified, ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively. However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20 frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

- **[A Survey of Link Prediction in N-ary Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08970)**  `arXiv:2506.08970`  
  _Jiyao Wei, Saiping Guan, Da Li, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications. This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline promising directions for future research.

- **[Evaluating Generative Vehicle Trajectory Models for Traffic Intersection Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08963)**  `arXiv:2506.08963`  
  _Yash Ranjan, Rahul Sengupta, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live' microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection. We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors and present our results.

  _Yash Ranjan, Rahul Sengupta, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28% of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation metrics.

- **[Preference-Driven Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization with Conditional Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08898)**  `arXiv:2506.08898`  
  _Mingfeng Fan, Jianan Zhou, Yifeng Zhang, Yaoxin Wu, Jinbiao Chen, Guillaume Adrien Sartoretti_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values. Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority and strong generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

- **[Measuring Data Science Automation: A Survey of Evaluation Tools for AI Assistants and Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08800)**  `arXiv:2506.08800`  
  _Irene Testini, Jos√© Hern√°ndez-Orallo, Lorenzo Pacchiardi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data science aims to extract insights from data to support decision-making processes. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

  _Kongcheng Zhang, Qi Yao, Shunyu Liu, Yingjie Wang, Baisheng Lai, Jieping Ye, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo, an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing supervised RL. Our code is available atthis https URL.

- **[Modular Recurrence in Contextual MDPs for Universal Morphology Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08630)**  `arXiv:2506.08630`  
  _Laurens Engwegen, Daan Brinks, Wendelin B√∂hmer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however, remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

- **[FoldA: Computing Partial-Order Alignments Using Directed Net Unfoldings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08627)**  `arXiv:2506.08627`  
  _Douwe Geurtjens, Xixi Lu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6 benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

- **[HGFormer: A Hierarchical Graph Transformer Framework for Two-Stage Colonel Blotto Games via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08580)**  `arXiv:2506.08580`  
  _Yang Lv, Jinlong Lei, Peng Yi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

- **[Safe and Economical UAV Trajectory Planning in Low-Altitude Airspace: A Hybrid DRL-LLM Approach with Compliance Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08532)**  `arXiv:2506.08532`  
  _Yanwei Gong, Xiaolin Chang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.

  _Sunny Gupta, Nikita Jangid, Shounak Das, Amit Sethi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization, existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both centralized and federated settings.

- **[RHealthTwin: Towards Responsible and Multimodal Digital Twins for Personalized Well-being](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08486)**  `arXiv:2506.08486`  
  _Rahatara Ferdousi, M Anwar Hossain_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination, bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe, relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation, outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area. This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques to other domains.

  _Yong Liang Goh, Zhiguang Cao, Yining Ma, Jianan Zhou, Mohammad Haroon Dupty, Wee Sun Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles. Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

- **[Single-Node Trigger Backdoor Attacks in Graph-Based Recommendation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08401)**  `arXiv:2506.08401`  
  _Runze Li, Di Jin, Xiaobao Wang, Dongxiao He, Bingdao Feng, Zhen Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However, these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node. Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

  _Jiachen Ma, Zhanhui Zhou, Chao Yang, Chaochao Lu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring safe and appropriate responses from vision-language models (VLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios. We introduce SafeCoT, a lightweight, interpretable framework that leverages rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in VLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on large-scale safety annotations or complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help models reason about safety risks and make context-aware refusals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SafeCoT significantly reduces overrefusal and enhances generalization, even with limited training data. Our approach offers a scalable solution for aligning VLMs with safety-critical objectives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector. Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token </think> to affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling their reasoning behaviors. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process. Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs, improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones. First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet, specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad application prospects.

  Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex, long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation. Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents. Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available atthis http URL. We also release the prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench with SOPs from their industrial domains.

  The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.

  Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured, efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty and synthesize robustthis http URLevaluate Guideline Forest on four benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation, underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance, especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps. Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations, improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

  Deep learning models, despite their popularity, face challenges such as long training times and a lack of interpretability. In contrast, fuzzy inference systems offer a balance of accuracy and transparency. This paper addresses the limitations of traditional Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy models by extending the recently proposed New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang model to a new Mamdani-based regressor. These models are data-driven, allowing users to define the number of rules to balance accuracy and interpretability. To handle the complexity of large datasets, this research integrates wrapper and ensemble techniques. A Genetic Algorithm is used as a wrapper for feature selection, creating genetic versions of the models. Furthermore, ensemble models, including the Random New Mamdani Regressor, Random New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, and Random Forest New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, are introduced to improve robustness. The proposed models are validated on photovoltaic energy forecasting datasets, a critical application due to the intermittent nature of solar power. Results demonstrate that the genetic and ensemble fuzzy models, particularly the Genetic New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang and Random Forest New Takagi-Sugeno-Kang, achieve superior performance. They often outperform both traditional machine learning and deep learning models while providing a simpler and more interpretable rule-based structure. The models are available online in a library called nfisis (this https URL).

  Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban environments. Previous work has mainly focused on rule-based agent-based modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy. In contrast, deep learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban context. A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior. However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a training-free textual gradient method. Experiments across four major U.S. cities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline. Furthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios. Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

  Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of large reasoning models.

  Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

  The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

  This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of contemporary digital transformation by integrating generative AI and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with an Automation Agent to realize End-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing tasks. While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making. This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.

  Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts update and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose \textbf{BalancEdit}, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite major advances in machine learning, current artificial intelligence systems continue to fall short of human-like general intelligence. While large language models can generate fluent and coherent outputs, they lack the deep understanding and adaptive reasoning that characterize truly general intelligence. Existing evaluation frameworks, which are centered on broad language or perception tasks, fail to capture generality at its core and offer little guidance for incremental progress. To address this gap, this paper introduces the artificial general intelligence testbed (AGITB), a novel and freely available benchmarking suite comprising twelve fully automatable tests designed to evaluate low-level cognitive precursors through binary signal prediction. AGITB requires models to forecast temporal sequences without pretraining, symbolic manipulation, or semantic grounding. The framework isolates core computational invariants - such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalization - that align with principles of biological information processing. Engineered to resist brute-force and memorization-based approaches, AGITB presumes no prior knowledge and demands learning from first principles. While humans pass all tests, no current AI system has met the full AGITB criteria, underscoring its potential as a rigorous, interpretable, and actionable benchmark for guiding and evaluating progress toward artificial general intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent work has found that vision-language models trained under the Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework contain intrinsic social biases, the extent to which different upstream pre-training features of the framework relate to these biases, and hence how intrinsic bias and downstream performance are connected has been unclear. In this work, we present the largest comprehensive analysis to-date of how the upstream pre-training factors and downstream performance of CLIP models relate to their intrinsic biases. Studying 131 unique CLIP models, trained on 26 datasets, using 55 architectures, and in a variety of sizes, we evaluate bias in each model using 26 well-established unimodal and cross-modal principled Embedding Association Tests. We find that the choice of pre-training dataset is the most significant upstream predictor of bias, whereas architectural variations have minimal impact. Additionally, datasets curated using sophisticated filtering techniques aimed at enhancing downstream model performance tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic bias. Finally, we observe that intrinsic bias is often significantly correlated with downstream performance ($0.3 \leq r \leq 0.8$), suggesting that models optimized for performance inadvertently learn to amplify representational biases. Comparisons between unimodal and cross-modal association tests reveal that social group bias depends heavily on the modality. Our findings imply that more sophisticated strategies are needed to address intrinsic model bias for vision-language models across the entire model development pipeline.

  Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Innate values describe agents' intrinsic motivations, which reflect their inherent interests and preferences for pursuing goals and drive them to develop diverse skills that satisfy their various needs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) is learning from interaction based on the feedback rewards of the environment. However, in real scenarios, the rewards are generated by agents' innate value systems, which differ vastly from individuals based on their needs and requirements. In other words, considering the AI agent as a self-organizing system, developing its awareness through balancing internal and external utilities based on its needs in different tasks is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support others and integrate community with safety and harmony in the long term. To address this gap, we propose a new RL model termed innate-values-driven RL (IVRL) based on combined motivations' models and expected utility theory to mimic its complex behaviors in the evolution through decision-making and learning. Then, we introduce two IVRL-based models: IV-DQN and IV-A2C. By comparing them with benchmark algorithms such as DQN, DDQN, A2C, and PPO in the Role-Playing Game (RPG) reinforcement learning test platform VIZDoom, we demonstrated that the IVRL-based models can help the agent rationally organize various needs, achieve better performance effectively.

  We introduce a relational approach to program synthesis. The key idea is to decompose synthesis tasks into simpler relational synthesis subtasks.

We demonstrate our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic programming (ILP) system on four challenging synthesis datasets. Our results show that (i) our representation can outperform a standard one, and (ii) an off-the-shelf ILP system with our representation can outperform domain-specific approaches.

  Agent Based Models (ABMs) often deal with systems where there is a lack of quantitative data or where quantitative data alone may be insufficient to fully capture the complexities of real-world systems. Expert knowledge and qualitative insights, such as those obtained through interviews, ethnographic research, historical accounts, or participatory workshops, are critical in constructing realistic behavioral rules, interactions, and decision-making processes within these models. However, there is a lack of systematic approaches that are able to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data across the entire modeling cycle. To address this, we propose FREIDA (FRamework for Expert-Informed Data-driven Agent-based models), a systematic mixed-methods framework to develop, train, and validate ABMs, particularly in data-sparse contexts. Our main technical innovation is to extract what we call Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) from qualitative data, which are testable statements that can be evaluated on model simulations. Divided into Calibration Statements (CS) for model calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for model validation, they provide a quantitative scoring mechanism on the same footing as quantitative data. In this way, qualitative insights can inform not only model specification but also its parameterization and assessment of fitness for purpose, which is a long standing challenge. We illustrate the application of FREIDA through a case study of criminal cocaine networks in the Netherlands.

  Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.

  The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and costthis http URLis available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study examines the lexical and syntactic interventions of human and LLM proofreading aimed at improving overall intelligibility in identical second language writings, and evaluates the consistency of outcomes across three LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b, Deepseek-r1-8b). Findings show that both human and LLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to better coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However, LLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking vocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and sophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective modifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in major lexical and syntactic features across the three models.

  Scaling test-time compute brings substantial performance gains for large language models (LLMs). By sampling multiple answers and heuristically aggregate their answers (e.g., either through majority voting or using verifiers to rank the answers), one can achieve consistent performance gains in math domains. In this paper, we propose a new way to leverage such multiple sample set. We train a compact LLM, called Sample Set Aggregator (SSA), that takes a concatenated sequence of multiple samples and output the final answer, optimizing it for the answer accuracy with reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple reasoning datasets show that SSA outperforms other test-time scaling methods such as reward model-based re-ranking. Our approach also shows a promising generalization ability, across sample set sizes, base model families and scales, and tasks. By separating LLMs to generate answers and LLMs to analyze and aggregate sampled answers, our approach can work with the outputs from premier black box models easily and efficiently.

  The present study extends recent work on Universal Dependencies annotations for second-language (L2) Korean by introducing a semi-automated framework that identifies morphosyntactic constructions from XPOS sequences and aligns those constructions with corresponding UPOS categories. We also broaden the existing L2-Korean corpus by annotating 2,998 new sentences from argumentative essays. To evaluate the impact of XPOS-UPOS alignments, we fine-tune L2-Korean morphosyntactic analysis models on datasets both with and without these alignments, using two NLP toolkits. Our results indicate that the aligned dataset not only improves consistency across annotation layers but also enhances morphosyntactic tagging and dependency-parsing accuracy, particularly in cases of limited annotated data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce **SWE-Flow**, a novel data synthesis framework grounded in Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike existing software engineering data that rely on human-submitted issues, **SWE-Flow** automatically infers incremental development steps directly from unit tests, which inherently encapsulate high-level requirements. The core of **SWE-Flow** is the construction of a Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG), which precisely captures function interactions, enabling the generation of a structured, step-by-step *development schedule*. At each step, **SWE-Flow** produces a partial codebase, the corresponding unit tests, and the necessary code modifications, resulting in fully verifiable TDD tasks. With this approach, we generated 16,061 training instances and 2,020 test instances from real-world GitHub projects, creating the **SWE-Flow-Eval** benchmark. Our experiments show that fine-tuning open model on this dataset significantly improves performance in TDD-based coding. To facilitate further research, we release all code, datasets, models, and Docker images at [Github](this https URL).

  Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample, comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004 labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and urban settings.

  Early detection is crucial for timely intervention aimed at preventing and slowing the progression of neurocognitive disorder (NCD), a common and significant health problem among the aging population. Recent evidence has suggested that language-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may be a promising approach for detecting cognitive decline and early NCD. In this paper, we proposed a novel, naturalistic language-related fMRI task for this purpose. We examined the effectiveness of this task among 97 non-demented Chinese older adults from Hong Kong. The results showed that machine-learning classification models based on fMRI features extracted from the task and demographics (age, gender, and education year) achieved an average area under the curve of 0.86 when classifying participants' cognitive status (labeled as NORMAL vs DECLINE based on their scores on a standard neurcognitive test). Feature localization revealed that the fMRI features most frequently selected by the data-driven approach came primarily from brain regions associated with language processing, such as the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and right cerebellum. The study demonstrated the potential of the naturalistic language-related fMRI task for early detection of aging-related cognitive decline and NCD.

  We introduce a new FROST-EMA (Finnish and Russian Oral Speech Dataset of Electromagnetic Articulography) corpus. It consists of 18 bilingual speakers, who produced speech in their native language (L1), second language (L2), and imitated L2 (fake foreign accent). The new corpus enables research into language variability from phonetic and technological points of view. Accordingly, we include two preliminary case studies to demonstrate both perspectives. The first case study explores the impact of L2 and imitated L2 on the performance of an automatic speaker verification system, while the second illustrates the articulatory patterns of one speaker in L1, L2, and a fake accent.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in political discourse.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it with the LLM`s parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model`s parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model`s parametric knowledge, which undermines the model`s internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling discrepancies between the model`s parametric knowledge and retrieved context. Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://this http URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing access to high-performance AI research.this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating knowledge to a wide range of relations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Natural language understanding systems struggle with low-resource languages, including many dialects of high-resource ones. Dialect-to-standard normalization attempts to tackle this issue by transforming dialectal text so that it can be used by standard-language tools downstream. In this study, we tackle this task by introducing a new normalization method that combines rule-based linguistically informed transformations and large language models (LLMs) with targeted few-shot prompting, without requiring any parallel data. We implement our method for Greek dialects and apply it on a dataset of regional proverbs, evaluating the outputs using human annotators. We then use this dataset to conduct downstream experiments, finding that previous results regarding these proverbs relied solely on superficial linguistic information, including orthographic artifacts, while new observations can still be made through the remaining semantics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however, plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology, encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary innovation in computational plant science.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families. Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction. Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches (text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models (LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%. Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

  Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in reasoning abilities and general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their performance on Arabic data, characterized by rich morphology, diverse dialects, and complex script, remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale. The code is available atthis https URL

  _Mishca de Costa, Muhammad Anwar, Dave Mercier, Mark Randall, Issam Hammad_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieving operational data from nuclear power plants requires exceptional accuracy and transparency due to the criticality of the decisions it supports. Traditionally, natural language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approaches have been explored for querying such data. While NL-to-SQL promises ease of use, it poses significant risks: end-users cannot easily validate generated SQL queries, and legacy nuclear plant databases -- often complex and poorly structured -- complicate query generation due to decades of incremental modifications. These challenges increase the likelihood of inaccuracies and reduce trust in the approach. In this work, we propose an alternative paradigm: leveraging function-calling large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. Instead of directly generating SQL queries, we define a set of pre-approved, purpose-specific functions representing common use cases. Queries are processed by invoking these functions, which encapsulate validated SQL logic. This hybrid approach mitigates the risks associated with direct NL-to-SQL translations by ensuring that SQL queries are reviewed and optimized by experts before deployment. While this strategy introduces the upfront cost of developing and maintaining the function library, we demonstrate how NL-to-SQL tools can assist in the initial generation of function code, allowing experts to focus on validation rather than creation. Our study includes a performance comparison between direct NL-to-SQL generation and the proposed function-based approach, highlighting improvements in accuracy and maintainability. This work underscores the importance of balancing user accessibility with operational safety and provides a novel, actionable framework for robust data retrieval in critical systems.

  This study explores the application of in-context learning (ICL) to the dialogue state tracking (DST) problem and investigates the factors that influence its effectiveness. We use a sentence embedding based k-nearest neighbour method to retrieve the suitable demonstrations for ICL. The selected demonstrations, along with the test samples, are structured within a template as input to the LLM. We then conduct a systematic study to analyse the impact of factors related to demonstration selection and prompt context on DST performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama3.2-3B-Instruct models. Our findings provide several useful insights on in-context learning abilities of LLMs for dialogue state tracking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The nuclear industry possesses a wealth of valuable information locked away in unstructured text data. This data, however, is not readily usable for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications that require clean, structured question-answer pairs for tasks like model training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. This paper explores how synthetic data generation can bridge this gap, enabling the development of robust LLMs for the nuclear domain. We discuss the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns inherent in the nuclear industry and how synthetic data provides a solution by transforming existing text data into usable Q&A pairs. This approach leverages LLMs to analyze text, extract key information, generate relevant questions, and evaluate the quality of the resulting synthetic dataset. By unlocking the potential of LLMs in the nuclear industry, synthetic data can pave the way for improved information retrieval, enhanced knowledge sharing, and more informed decision-making in this critical sector.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a domain-specific Large Language Model for nuclear applications, built from the publicly accessible Essential CANDU textbook. Drawing on a compact Transformer-based architecture, the model is trained on a single GPU to protect the sensitive data inherent in nuclear operations. Despite relying on a relatively small dataset, it shows encouraging signs of capturing specialized nuclear vocabulary, though the generated text sometimes lacks syntactic coherence. By focusing exclusively on nuclear content, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of in-house LLM solutions that align with rigorous cybersecurity and data confidentiality standards. Early successes in text generation underscore the model's utility for specialized tasks, while also revealing the need for richer corpora, more sophisticated preprocessing, and instruction fine-tuning to enhance domain accuracy. Future directions include extending the dataset to cover diverse nuclear subtopics, refining tokenization to reduce noise, and systematically evaluating the model's readiness for real-world applications in nuclear domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

  _Hee Suk Yoon, Eunseop Yoon, Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson, Sungwoong Kim, Chang D. Yoo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators, raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple, lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scientific fact-checking has mostly focused on text and tables, overlooking scientific charts, which are key for presenting quantitative evidence and statistical reasoning. We introduce ClimateViz, the first large-scale benchmark for scientific fact-checking using expert-curated scientific charts. ClimateViz contains 49,862 claims linked to 2,896 visualizations, each labeled as support, refute, or not enough information. To improve interpretability, each example includes structured knowledge graph explanations covering trends, comparisons, and causal relations. We evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal language models, including both proprietary and open-source systems, in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Results show that current models struggle with chart-based reasoning: even the best systems, such as Gemini 2.5 and InternVL 2.5, reach only 76.2 to 77.8 percent accuracy in label-only settings, far below human performance (89.3 and 92.7 percent). Explanation-augmented outputs improve performance in some models. We released our dataset and code alongside the paper.

  _Yang Liu, Jiaqi Li, Zilong Zheng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However, it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1% average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

  We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods, they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First, they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues. Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62% (49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for both open-ended and structured tasks, yet their inference-time behavior is still largely dictated by heuristic decoding strategies such as greedy search, sampling, or reranking. These methods provide limited control and do not explicitly optimize for task-specific objectives. We introduce MEMETRON, a task-agnostic framework that formulates LLM decoding as a discrete black-box optimization problem. MEMETRON leverages hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, GENETRON and ANNETRON, to search the response space, guided by reward models and contextual operations performed by the LLM itself. This approach enables efficient discovery of high-reward responses without requiring model retraining or gradient access. The framework is modular and generalizes across diverse tasks, requiring only a reward function and lightweight prompt templates. We evaluate our framework on the critical human preference alignment task and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms standard decoding and reranking methods, highlighting its potential to improve alignment without model retraining.

  Scientific reasoning requires not only long-chain reasoning processes, but also knowledge of domain-specific terminologies and adaptation to updated findings. To deal with these challenges for scientific reasoning, we introduce RAISE, a step-by-step retrieval-augmented framework which retrieves logically relevant documents from in-the-wild corpus. RAISE is divided into three steps: problem decomposition, logical query generation, and logical retrieval. We observe that RAISE consistently outperforms other baselines on scientific reasoning benchmarks. We analyze that unlike other baselines, RAISE retrieves documents that are not only similar in terms of the domain knowledge, but also documents logically more relevant.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hate speech detection is a socially sensitive and inherently subjective task, with judgments often varying based on personal traits. While prior work has examined how socio-demographic factors influence annotation, the impact of personality traits on Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the role of persona prompts in hate speech classification, focusing on MBTI-based traits. A human annotation survey confirms that MBTI dimensions significantly affect labeling behavior. Extending this to LLMs, we prompt four open-source models with MBTI personas and evaluate their outputs across three hate speech datasets. Our analysis uncovers substantial persona-driven variation, including inconsistencies with ground truth, inter-persona disagreement, and logit-level biases. These findings highlight the need to carefully define persona prompts in LLM-based annotation workflows, with implications for fairness and alignment with human values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work focuses on an observed limitation of text encoders: embeddings may not be able to recognize fine-grained entities or events within the semantics, resulting in failed dense retrieval on even simple cases. To examine such behaviors, we first introduce a new evaluation dataset in Chinese, named CapRetrieval, whose passages are image captions, and queries are phrases inquiring entities or events in various forms. Zero-shot evaluation suggests that encoders may fail on these fine-grained matching, regardless of training sources or model sizes. Aiming for enhancement, we proceed to finetune encoders with our proposed data generation strategies, which obtains the best performance on CapRetrieval. Within this process, we further identify an issue of granularity dilemma, a challenge for embeddings to express fine-grained salience while aligning with overall semantics. Our dataset, code and models in this work are publicly released atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for use in mental health support, yet their behavior in realistic counseling scenarios remains largely untested. We introduce CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test LLMs in single-turn counseling. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000 expert evaluations of responses from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and online human therapists to real patient questions. Each response is rated along six clinically grounded dimensions, with written rationales and span-level annotations. We find that LLMs often outperform online human therapists in perceived quality, but experts frequently flag their outputs for safety concerns such as unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that LLM judges consistently overrate model responses and overlook safety issues identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored counseling questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation across 2,880 responses from eight LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns. Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking and improving LLM behavior in high-stakes mental health settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA without additional training.

The corpus (code-mixed in Hindi and English) has both audio and transcribed text and is annotated with nine discourse relations. We experiment with various SoTA baseline models; the poor performance of SoTA models highlights the challenges of multi-domain code-mixed corpus, pointing towards the need for developing better models for such realistic settings.

  Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Intent detection aims to identify user intents from natural language inputs, where supervised methods rely heavily on labeled in-domain (IND) data and struggle with out-of-domain (OOD) intents, limiting their practical applicability. Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) addresses this by leveraging unlabeled OOD data to discover new intents without additional annotation. However, existing methods focus solely on clustering unsupervised data while neglecting domain adaptation. Therefore, we propose a consistency-driven prototype-prompting framework for GID from the perspective of integrating old and new knowledge, which includes a prototype-prompting framework for transferring old knowledge from external sources, and a hierarchical consistency constraint for learning new knowledge from target domains. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that our method significantly outperforms all baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art results, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma 3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable. Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2 models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points. These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

  Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of image-text alignment in text-to-image generation.

In this work, we first identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models. Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Detecting harmful memes is essential for maintaining the integrity of online environments. However, current approaches often struggle with resource efficiency, flexibility, or explainability, limiting their practical deployment in content moderation systems. To address these challenges, we introduce U-CoT+, a novel framework for harmful meme detection. Instead of relying solely on prompting or fine-tuning multimodal models, we first develop a high-fidelity meme-to-text pipeline that converts visual memes into detail-preserving textual descriptions. This design decouples meme interpretation from meme classification, thus avoiding immediate reasoning over complex raw visual content and enabling resource-efficient harmful meme detection with general large language models (LLMs). Building on these textual descriptions, we further incorporate targeted, interpretable human-crafted guidelines to guide models' reasoning under zero-shot CoT prompting. As such, this framework allows for easy adaptation to different harmfulness detection criteria across platforms, regions, and over time, offering high flexibility and explainability. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for explainable and low-resource harmful meme detection using small-scale LLMs. Codes and data are available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Most existing structured pruning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational and data resources for retraining to reestablish the corrupted correlations, making them prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose a pruning framework for LLMs called Orthogonal decomposition and Linear Calibration (Olica), which eliminates the need for retraining. A key observation is that the multi-head attention (MHA) layer depends on two types of matrix products. By treating these matrix products as unified entities and applying principal component analysis (PCA), we extract the most important information to compress LLMs without sacrificing accuracy or disrupting their original structure. Consequently, retraining becomes unnecessary. A fast decomposition method is devised, reducing the complexity of PCA by a factor of the square of the number of attention heads. Additionally, to mitigate error accumulation problem caused by pruning the feed-forward network (FFN) layer, we introduce a linear calibration method to reconstruct the residual errors of pruned layers using low-rank matrices. By leveraging singular value decomposition (SVD) on the solution of the least-squares problem, these matrices are obtained without requiring retraining. Extensive experiments show that the proposed Olica is efficient in terms of data usage, GPU memory, and running time, while delivering superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

  Large language model (LLM) have become mainstream methods in the field of sarcasm detection. However, existing LLM methods face challenges in irony detection, including: 1. single-perspective limitations, 2. insufficient comprehensive understanding, and 3. lack of interpretability. This paper introduces the Collaborative Agent Framework for Irony (CAF-I), an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to overcome these issues. CAF-I employs specialized agents for Context, Semantics, and Rhetoric, which perform multidimensional analysis and engage in interactive collaborative optimization. A Decision Agent then consolidates these perspectives, with a Refinement Evaluator Agent providing conditional feedback for optimization. Experiments on benchmark datasets establish CAF-I's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Achieving SOTA on the vast majority of metrics, CAF-I reaches an average Macro-F1 of 76.31, a 4.98 absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. This success is attained by its effective simulation of human-like multi-perspective analysis, enhancing detection accuracy and interpretability.

  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, there is a growing urgency to enhance the interpretability of their internal knowledge mechanisms. Consequently, many interpretation methods have emerged, aiming to unravel the knowledge mechanisms of LLMs from various perspectives. However, current interpretation methods differ in input data formats and interpreting outputs. The tools integrating these methods are only capable of supporting tasks with specific inputs, significantly constraining their practical applications. To address these challenges, we present an open-source Knowledge Mechanisms Revealer&Interpreter (Know-MRI) designed to analyze the knowledge mechanisms within LLMs systematically. Specifically, we have developed an extensible core module that can automatically match different input data with interpretation methods and consolidate the interpreting outputs. It enables users to freely choose appropriate interpretation methods based on the inputs, making it easier to comprehensively diagnose the model's internal knowledge mechanisms from multiple perspectives.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Previous research has primarily focused on the cognitive error detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), often prompting them to analyze mistakes in reasoning chains. However, few studies have examined the meta-cognitive abilities of LLMs (e.g., their self-awareness of step errors), which are crucial for their reliability. While studies on LLM self-evaluation present some measures, such as perplexity, which can reflect the answer correctness and be viewed as the lens of meta-cognition, they lack step-level analysis and adaptation. This paper studies the evaluation of LLM meta-cognition using the current lenses and how to improve these lenses. Specifically, we propose AutoMeco, an Automated Meta-cognition Evaluation framework for benchmarking the existing lenses. Furthermore, a training-free Markovian Intrinsic Reward Adjustment strategy, MIRA, is proposed to boost current meta-cognition lenses. Experimental results on three mathematical reasoning datasets and three LLMs show the reasonableness of AutoMeco by comparing it with Best-of-N verification. Moreover, the meta-cognition ability of LLMs can be better evaluated using MIRA.

  Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation. Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23.

  With the development and widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the new paradigm of "Model as Product" is rapidly evolving, and demands higher capabilities to address complex user needs, often requiring precise workflow execution which involves the accurate understanding of multiple tasks. However, existing benchmarks focusing on single-task environments with limited constraints lack the complexity required to fully reflect real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present the Extremely Complex Instruction Following Benchmark (EIFBENCH), meticulously crafted to facilitate a more realistic and robust evaluation of LLMs. EIFBENCH not only includes multi-task scenarios that enable comprehensive assessment across diverse task types concurrently, but also integrates a variety of constraints, replicating complex operational environments. Furthermore, we propose the Segment Policy Optimization (SegPO) algorithm to enhance the LLM's ability to accurately fulfill multi-task workflow. Evaluations on EIFBENCH have unveiled considerable performance discrepancies in existing LLMs when challenged with these extremely complex instructions. This finding underscores the necessity for ongoing optimization to navigate the intricate challenges posed by LLM applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) support long contexts, they struggle with performance degradation within the context window. Current solutions incur prohibitive training costs, leaving statistical behaviors and cost-effective approaches underexplored. From the decoding perspective, we identify the Posterior Salience Attenuation (PSA) phenomenon, where the salience ratio correlates with long-text performance degradation. Notably, despite the attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates attention score degradation. Experimental results show that PCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-context benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding cause and effect relationships remains a formidable challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in specialized domains where reasoning requires more than surface-level correlations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy, but standard RAG pipelines treat evidence as flat context, lacking the structure required to model true causal dependencies. We introduce Causal-Chain RAG (CC-RAG), a novel approach that integrates zero-shot triple extraction and theme-aware graph chaining into the RAG pipeline, enabling structured multi-hop inference. Given a domain specific corpus, CC-RAG constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of <cause, relation, effect> triples and uses forward/backward chaining to guide structured answer generation. Experiments on two real-world domains: Bitcoin price fluctuations and Gaucher disease, show that CC-RAG outperforms standard RAG and zero-shot LLMs in chain similarity, information density, and lexical diversity. Both LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations consistently favor CC-RAG. Our results demonstrate that explicitly modeling causal structure enables LLMs to generate more accurate and interpretable responses, especially in specialized domains where flat retrieval fails.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference-time steering aims to alter the response characteristics of large language models (LLMs) without modifying their underlying parameters. A critical step in this process is the identification of internal modules within LLMs that are associated with the target behavior. However, current approaches to module selection often depend on superficial cues or ad-hoc heuristics, which can result in suboptimal or unintended outcomes. In this work, we propose a principled causal-attribution framework for identifying behavior-relevant attention heads in transformers. For each head, we train a vector-quantized autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its attention activations, partitioning the latent space into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces, each quantized with a shared learnable codebook. We assess the behavioral relevance of each head by quantifying the separability of VQ-AE encodings for behavior-aligned versus behavior-violating responses using a binary classification metric. This yields a behavioral relevance score that reflects each head discriminative capacity with respect to the target behavior, guiding both selection and importance weighting. Experiments on seven LLMs from two model families and five behavioral steering datasets demonstrate that our method enables more accurate inference-time interventions, achieving superior performance on the truthfulness-steering task. Furthermore, the heads selected by our approach exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp, comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek. Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large reasoning models have enabled complex, step-by-step reasoning but often introduce significant overthinking, resulting in verbose and redundant outputs that hinder efficiency. In this study, we examine whether explicit self-reflection, signaled by tokens such as "Wait" and "Hmm", is necessary for advanced reasoning. We propose NoWait, a simple yet effective approach that disables explicit self-reflection by suppressing these tokens during inference. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks across textual, visual, and video reasoning tasks show that NoWait reduces chain-of-thought trajectory length by up to 27%-51% in five R1-style model series, without compromising model utility. NoWait thus offers a plug-and-play solution for efficient and utility-preserving multimodal reasoning.

  Large language models (LLMs) use data to learn about the world in order to produce meaningful correlations and predictions. As such, the nature, scale, quality, and diversity of the datasets used to train these models, or to support their work at inference time, have a direct impact on their quality. The rapid development and adoption of LLMs of varying quality has brought into focus the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality training data and revealed an urgent need to ground the stewardship of these datasets in sustainable practices with clear provenance chains. To that end, this technical report introduces Institutional Books 1.0, a large collection of public domain books originally digitized through Harvard Library's participation in the Google Books project, beginning in 2006. Working with Harvard Library, we extracted, analyzed, and processed these volumes into an extensively-documented dataset of historic texts. This analysis covers the entirety of Harvard Library's collection scanned as part of that project, originally spanning 1,075,899 volumes written in over 250 different languages for a total of approximately 250 billion tokens. As part of this initial release, the OCR-extracted text (original and post-processed) as well as the metadata (bibliographic, source, and generated) of the 983,004 volumes, or 242B tokens, identified as being in the public domain have been made available. This report describes this project's goals and methods as well as the results of the analyses we performed, all in service of making this historical collection more accessible and easier for humans and machines alike to filter, read and use.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension (RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning, achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade 3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable, high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs' abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable reasoning across full-length papers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. A list of surveyed papers is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models(LLMs) like Gemini are becoming common tools for supporting student writing. But most of their feedback is based only on the final essay missing important context about how that text was written. In this paper, we explore whether using writing process data, collected through keystroke logging and periodic snapshots, can help LLMs give feedback that better reflects how learners think and revise while writing. We built a digital writing tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve over time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were then evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final essay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed surveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results show that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in tune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like adding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher scores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that making LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels more meaningful, personal, and supportive.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of English technical terms challenges traditional expert-driven standardization, especially in fast-evolving fields like AI and quantum computing. Manual methods struggle to ensure multilingual consistency. We propose \textbf{LLM-BT}, a back-translation framework powered by large language models (LLMs) to automate terminology verification and standardization via cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our contributions are: \textbf{(1) Term-Level Consistency Validation:} Using English $\rightarrow$ intermediate language $\rightarrow$ English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term consistency across models (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek, Grok), with case studies showing over 90\% exact or semantic matches. \textbf{(2) Multi-Path Verification Workflow:} A novel ``Retrieve--Generate--Verify--Optimize'' pipeline integrates serial (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ ZHcn $\rightarrow$ ZHtw $\rightarrow$ EN) and parallel (e.g., EN $\rightarrow$ Chinese/Portuguese $\rightarrow$ EN) BT routes. BLEU and term accuracy indicate strong cross-lingual robustness (BLEU $>$ 0.45; Portuguese accuracy 100\%). \textbf{(3) Back-Translation as Semantic Embedding:} BT is conceptualized as dynamic semantic embedding, revealing latent meaning trajectories. Unlike static embeddings, LLM-BT provides transparent path-based embeddings shaped by model evolution. LLM-BT transforms back-translation into an active engine for multilingual terminology standardization, enabling human--AI collaboration: machines ensure semantic fidelity, humans guide cultural interpretation. This infrastructure supports terminology governance across scientific and technological fields worldwide.

  Automated story writing has been a subject of study for over 60 years. Large language models can generate narratively consistent and linguistically coherent short fiction texts. Despite these advancements, rigorous assessment of such outputs for literary merit - especially concerning aesthetic qualities - has received scant attention. In this paper, we address the challenge of evaluating AI-generated microfictions and argue that this task requires consideration of literary criteria across various aspects of the text, such as thematic coherence, textual clarity, interpretive depth, and aesthetic quality. To facilitate this, we present GrAImes: an evaluation protocol grounded in literary theory, specifically drawing from a literary perspective, to offer an objective framework for assessing AI-generated microfiction. Furthermore, we report the results of our validation of the evaluation protocol, as answered by both literature experts and literary enthusiasts. This protocol will serve as a foundation for evaluating automatically generated microfictions and assessing their literary value.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding (CKGE) seeks to integrate new knowledge while preserving past information. However, existing methods struggle with efficiency and scalability due to two key limitations: (1) suboptimal knowledge preservation between snapshots caused by manually designed node/relation importance scores that ignore graph dependencies relevant to the downstream task, and (2) computationally expensive graph traversal for node/relation importance calculation, leading to slow training and high memory overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce ETT-CKGE (Efficient, Task-driven, Tokens for Continual Knowledge Graph Embedding), a novel task-guided CKGE method that leverages efficient task-driven tokens for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between snapshots. Our method introduces a set of learnable tokens that directly capture task-relevant signals, eliminating the need for explicit node scoring or traversal. These tokens serve as consistent and reusable guidance across snapshots, enabling efficient token-masked embedding alignment between snapshots. Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved through simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive performance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability compared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity. While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators, following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of 0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B). These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline 0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline 0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

  We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability. Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding, plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation, and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed for economic web intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and reliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically collapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple objectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In this work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition approach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within the reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs a monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions and derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in reward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language model with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers greater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same time, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO baseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and controllable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing end-task performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit pronounced conservative bias in relation extraction tasks, frequently defaulting to No_Relation label when an appropriate option is unavailable. While this behavior helps prevent incorrect relation assignments, our analysis reveals that it also leads to significant information loss when reasoning is not explicitly included in the output. We systematically evaluate this trade-off across multiple prompts, datasets, and relation types, introducing the concept of Hobson's choice to capture scenarios where models opt for safe but uninformative labels over hallucinated ones. Our findings suggest that conservative bias occurs twice as often as hallucination. To quantify this effect, we use SBERT and LLM prompts to capture the semantic similarity between conservative bias behaviors in constrained prompts and labels generated from semi-constrained and open-ended prompts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding common visual elements, largely due to their large-scale datasets and advanced training strategies. However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...

  Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning, yet post-training remains critical for aligning their behavior with task goals. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods often depend on costly human annotations or external reward models. We propose Reinforcement Learning via Self-Confidence (RLSC), which uses the model's own confidence as reward signals-eliminating the need for labels, preference models, or reward engineering. Applied to Qwen2.5-Math-7B with only 16 samples per question and 10 or 20 training steps, RLSC improves accuracy by +13.4% on AIME2024, +21.2% on MATH500, +21.7% on Minerva Math, +20.8% on Olympiadbench, and +9.7% on AMC23. RLSC provides a simple, scalable post-training method for inference models, requiring only a small number of samples and unlabelled supervision.

  In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets. Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and multilingual retrieval.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations, and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies, we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

  We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

  Language model evaluation is a daunting task: prompts are brittle, corpus-level perplexities are vague, and the choice of benchmarks are endless. Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs. Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in fine-grained contexts, such as "conditional 'were' in the phrase 'if you were'" and "exclamation marks after emotional statements", where one model outperforms another within a particular datatset. We apply BehaviorBox to compare models that vary in size, model family, and post-training, and enumerate insights into specific contexts that illustrate meaningful differences in performance which cannot be found by measures such as corpus-level perplexity alone.

  Large language model (LLM) agents have shown impressive capabilities in human language comprehension and reasoning, yet their potential in cybersecurity remains underexplored. We introduce DefenderBench, a practical, open-source toolkit for evaluating language agents across offense, defense, and cybersecurity knowledge-based tasks. DefenderBench includes environments for network intrusion, malicious content detection, code vulnerability analysis, and cybersecurity knowledge assessment. It is intentionally designed to be affordable and easily accessible for researchers while providing fair and rigorous assessment. We benchmark several state-of-the-art (SoTA) and popular LLMs, including both open- and closed-weight models, using a standardized agentic framework. Our results show that Claude-3.7-sonnet performs best with a DefenderBench score of 81.65, followed by Claude-3.7-sonnet-think with 78.40, while the best open-weight model, Llama 3.3 70B, is not far behind with a DefenderBench score of 71.81. DefenderBench's modular design allows seamless integration of custom LLMs and tasks, promoting reproducibility and fair comparisons.

  Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines.

  Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal} computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task}, enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group coding to explicitly reduce redundancy by aggregating less important tokens during attention computation. Empirical results show that our DGA significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining competitivethis http URLis available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention, MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information. Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention, MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context; how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries. Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source of the transformer's ICL ability.

  _Tong Zheng, Lichang Chen, Simeng Han, R. Thomas McCoy, Heng Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.

  Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with three evaluation metrics as optimization targets. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing model selection first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing according to RAG pipeline order.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 44 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.

  Identifying bias in LLM-generated content is a crucial prerequisite for ensuring fairness in LLMs. Existing methods, such as fairness classifiers and LLM-based judges, face limitations related to difficulties in understanding underlying intentions and the lack of criteria for fairness judgment. In this paper, we introduce BiasGuard, a novel bias detection tool that explicitly analyzes inputs and reasons through fairness specifications to provide accurate judgments. BiasGuard is implemented through a two-stage approach: the first stage initializes the model to explicitly reason based on fairness specifications, while the second stage leverages reinforcement learning to enhance its reasoning and judgment capabilities. Our experiments, conducted across five datasets, demonstrate that BiasGuard outperforms existing tools, improving accuracy and reducing over-fairness misjudgments. We also highlight the importance of reasoning-enhanced decision-making and provide evidence for the effectiveness of our two-stage optimization pipeline.

  Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

  Automated Essay Scoring (AES) plays a crucial role in assessing language learners' writing quality, reducing grading workload, and providing real-time feedback. The lack of annotated essay datasets inhibits the development of Arabic AES systems. This paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer models to generate synthetic Arabic essays for AES. We prompt an LLM to generate essays across the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) proficiency levels and introduce and compare two approaches to error injection. We create a dataset of 3,040 annotated essays with errors injected using our two methods. Additionally, we develop a BERT-based Arabic AES system calibrated to CEFR levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthetic dataset in improving Arabic AES performance. We make our code and data publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic patent summarization approaches that help in the patent analysis and comprehension procedure are in high demand due to the colossal growth of innovations. The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which complicates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the author employed certain meta-learning techniques to achieve Domain Generalization (DG) of the abstractive component across multiple patent fields.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning reward models from human preference datasets and subsequently optimizing language models via reinforcement learning has emerged as a fundamental paradigm for aligning LLMs with human preferences. The performance of the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment. Previous reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the generation of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward may present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent efforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit semantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual token. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence, introducing an intermediate-grained reward model. By segmenting the complete response into sentences and applying differential operations to reward output at the start and end positions of each sentence, we can effectively model the rewards of sentences. Moreover, a novel attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate the scores of all sentences into a response-level score, which allows it to be trained using the Bradley-Terry model. On common benchmarks, our method outperforms the response-level reward model by 2.7% on RewardBench (for reward modeling evaluation) and surpasses all baselines on AlpacaEval (for alignment evaluation).

  Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate CCR evaluation for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.

  Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to utilize additional computation through intermediate tokens to solve complex tasks. However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks, potentially leaking training data due to implicit memorization. Existing privacy attacks primarily focus on membership inference attacks (MIAs) or data extraction attacks, but reconstructing specific personally identifiable information (PII) in LLMs' training data remains challenging. In this paper, we propose R.R. (Recollect and Rank), a novel two-step privacy stealing attack that enables attackers to reconstruct PII entities from scrubbed training data where the PII entities have been masked. In the first stage, we introduce a prompt paradigm named recollection, which instructs the LLM to repeat a masked text but fill in masks. Then we can use PII identifiers to extract recollected PII candidates. In the second stage, we design a new criterion to score each PII candidate and rank them. Motivated by membership inference, we leverage the reference model as a calibration to our criterion. Experiments across three popular PII datasets demonstrate that the R.R. achieves better PII identification performance than baselines. These results highlight the vulnerability of LLMs to PII leakage even when training data has been scrubbed. We release our code and datasets at GitHub.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms demonstrate significant speedups of up to 2.8x over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as a drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) contain large amounts of facts about the world. These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.

  Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.

  Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern language models are internally -- and mathematically -- distributions over $\it{token}$ strings rather than $\it{character}$ strings, posing numerous challenges for programmers building user applications on top of them. For example, if a prompt is specified as a character string, it must be tokenized before passing it to the token-level language model. Thus, the tokenizer and consequent processing are very sensitive to the specification of the prompt (e.g., whether the prompt ends with a space or not). This paper presents algorithms for converting token-level language models to character-level ones. We present both exact and approximate algorithms. In the empirical portion of the paper, we benchmark the practical runtime and approximation quality. Across four publicly available language models, we find that -- even with a small computation budget -- our method is able to accurately approximate the character-level distribution at reasonably fast speeds, and that a significant improvement in the language model's compression rate (bits/byte) is achieved.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Shared memories between two individuals strengthen their bond and are crucial for facilitating their ongoing conversations. This study aims to make long-term dialogue more engaging by leveraging these shared memories. To this end, we introduce a new long-term dialogue dataset named SHARE, constructed from movie scripts, which are a rich source of shared memories among various relationships. Our dialogue dataset contains the summaries of persona information and events of two individuals, as explicitly revealed in their conversation, along with implicitly extractable shared memories. We also introduce EPISODE, a long-term dialogue framework based on SHARE that utilizes shared experiences between individuals. Through experiments using SHARE, we demonstrate that shared memories between two individuals make long-term dialogues more engaging and sustainable, and that EPISODE effectively manages shared memories during dialogue. Our dataset and code are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised concerns about fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to marginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect real-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational complexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, \textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM fairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user interaction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks. To ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, we draw from existing fairness datasets and employ our template to construct a multi-turn dialogue dataset, \texttt{FairMT-10K}. For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias classifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness. Experiments and analyses on \texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses, and there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \texttt{FairMT-1K}, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results show the current state of fairness in LLMs and showcase the utility of this novel approach for assessing fairness in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts, calling for future work to focus on LLM fairness improvement and the adoption of \texttt{FairMT-1K} in such efforts.

  _Yoichi Ishibashi, Taro Yano, Masafumi Oyamada_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities, yet their improvement methods remain fundamentally constrained by human design. We present Self-Developing, a framework that enables LLMs to autonomously discover, implement, and refine their own improvement algorithms. Our approach employs an iterative cycle where a seed model generates algorithmic candidates as executable code, evaluates their effectiveness, and uses Direct Preference Optimization to recursively improve increasingly sophisticated improvement strategies. We demonstrate this framework through model merging, a practical technique for combining specialized models. Self-Developing successfully discovered novel merging algorithms that outperform existing human-designed algorithms. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, the autonomously discovered algorithms improve the seed model's GSM8k performance by 6\% and exceed human-designed approaches like Task Arithmetic by 4.3\%. Remarkably, these algorithms exhibit strong generalization, achieving 7.4\% gains on out-of-domain models without re-optimization. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can transcend their training to invent genuinely novel optimization techniques. This capability represents a crucial step toward a new era where LLMs not only solve problems but autonomously develop the methodologies for their own advancement.

  This paper presents the annotation guidelines of the Balanced Arabic Readability Evaluation Corpus (BAREC), a large-scale resource for fine-grained sentence-level readability assessment in Arabic. BAREC includes 69,441 sentences (1M+ words) labeled across 19 levels, from kindergarten to postgraduate. Based on the Taha/Arabi21 framework, the guidelines were refined through iterative training with native Arabic-speaking educators. We highlight key linguistic, pedagogical, and cognitive factors in determining readability and report high inter-annotator agreement: Quadratic Weighted Kappa 81.8% (substantial/excellent agreement) in the last annotation phase.

  High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal retrieval augmented generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in domains such as knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA), where external knowledge is needed to answer a question. However, existing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are not designed for context-augmented generation, limiting their effectiveness in such tasks. While synthetic data generation has recently gained attention for training MLLMs, its application for context-augmented generation remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce SK-VQA, a large-scale synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million visual question-answer pairs, each associated with context documents containing information necessary to determine the final answer. Compared to previous datasets, SK-VQA contains 11x more unique questions, exhibits greater domain diversity, and covers a broader spectrum of image sources. Through human evaluations, we confirm the high quality of the generated question-answer pairs and their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments show that SK-VQA serves both as a challenging KB-VQA benchmark and as an effective training resource for adapting MLLMs to context-augmented generation. Our results further indicate that models trained on SK-VQA demonstrate enhanced generalization in both context-aware VQA and multimodal RAG settings. SK-VQA is publicly available via Hugging Face Hub.

  Personalized large language models (LLMs) have attracted great attention in many applications, such as emotional support and role-playing. However, existing works primarily focus on modeling explicit character profiles, while ignoring the underlying personality traits that truly shape behaviors and decision-making, hampering the development of more anthropomorphic and psychologically-grounded AI systems. In this paper, we explore the modeling of Big Five personality traits, which is the most widely used trait theory in psychology, and propose P-React, a mixture of experts (MoE)-based personalized LLM. Particularly, we integrate a Personality Specialization Loss (PSL) to better capture individual trait expressions, providing a more nuanced and psychologically grounded personality simulacrum. To facilitate research in this field, we curate OCEAN-Chat, a high-quality, human-verified dataset designed to train LLMs in expressing personality traits across diverse topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of P-React in maintaining consistent and real personality.

  The pretraining of state-of-the-art large language models now requires trillions of words of text, which is orders of magnitude more than available for the vast majority of languages. While including text in more than one language is an obvious way to acquire more pretraining data, multilinguality is often seen as a curse, and most model training efforts continue to focus near-exclusively on individual large languages. We believe that multilinguality can be a blessing: when the lack of training data is a constraint for effectively training larger models for a target language, augmenting the dataset with other languages can offer a way to improve over the capabilities of monolingual models for that language. In this study, we introduce Poro 34B, a 34 billion parameter model trained for 1 trillion tokens of Finnish, English, and programming languages, and demonstrate that a multilingual training approach can produce a model that substantially advances over the capabilities of existing models for Finnish and excels in translation, while also achieving competitive performance in its class for English and programming languages.

  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various software engineering tasks, including error detection, clone detection, and code translation, primarily leveraging high-resource programming languages like Python and Java. However, many critical languages, such as COBOL, as well as emerging languages, such as Rust and Swift, remain low-resource due to limited openly available code. This scarcity hampers the training and effectiveness of LLMs for these languages, increasing software maintenance costs and stifling innovation. Addressing this gap, we investigate the potential of transfer learning to enhance LLM performance on low-resource programming languages by leveraging data from high-resource counterparts. Our extensive empirical study evaluates transferability across 10 to 41 programming languages and five key tasks: code generation, clone detection, code repair, solution domain classification, and error detection. Additionally, we develop a performance prediction model to guess the best source languages for a given target and task, and analyze the features that influence transfer performance. We further replicate a representative subset of experiments with a larger model to test the generalizability of our conclusions to contemporary large-scale LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer significantly outperforms zero-shot learning, with effectiveness varying based on both source and target languages. Furthermore, our model reliably predicts successful transfer sources by considering linguistic and dataset-specific features, offering practical guidance for data acquisition and model training. This work contributes to the development of LLM-driven tools for low-resource programming languages and provides insights into the characteristics that facilitate transfer across language pairs.

  Modeling long texts has been an essential technique in the field of natural language processing (NLP). With the ever-growing number of long documents, it is important to develop effective modeling methods that can process and analyze such texts. However, long texts pose important research challenges for existing text models, with more complex semantics and special characteristics. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent advances on long texts modeling based on Transformer models. Firstly, we introduce the formal definition of long text modeling. Then, as the core content, we discuss how to process long input to satisfy the length limitation and design improved Transformer architectures to effectively extend the maximum context length. Following this, we discuss how to adapt Transformer models to capture the special characteristics of long texts. Finally, we describe four typical applications involving long text modeling and conclude this paper with a discussion of future directions. Our survey intends to provide researchers with a synthesis and pointer to related work on long text modeling.

  We propose a novel method to conceptually decompose an existing annotation into separate levels, allowing the analysis of inter-annotators disagreement in each level separately. We suggest two distinct strategies in order to actualize this approach: a theoretically-driven one, in which the researcher defines a decomposition based on prior knowledge of the annotation task, and an exploration-based one, in which many possible decompositions are inductively computed and presented to the researcher for interpretation and evaluation. Utilizing a recently constructed dataset for narrative analysis as our use-case, we apply each of the two strategies to demonstrate the potential of our approach in testing hypotheses regarding the sources of annotation disagreements, as well as revealing latent structures and relations within the annotation task. We conclude by suggesting how to extend and generalize our approach, as well as use it for other purposes.

  Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

  Collecting and annotating real-world data for safety-critical physical AI systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle (AV), is time-consuming and costly. It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning. We open source our pipeline toolkit, dataset and model weights through the NVIDIA's Cosmos platform.Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available atthis https URL.

Our dataset bridges the gap between accuracy and data diversity in current SLAM benchmarks by introducing a novel ground truth collection framework that leverages calibration boards and a 360-camera. We collect indoor, outdoor, and object scanning videos with synchronized monocular and stereo RGB video outputs as well as IMU. We further propose a new scene scale-aware evaluation metric for SLAM based on the the optical flow induced by the camera pose estimation error. In contrast to the current metrics, our new metric allows for comparison between the performance of SLAM methods across scenes as opposed to existing metrics such as Average Trajectory Error (ATE), allowing researchers to analyze the failure modes of their methods. We also propose a challenging Novel View Synthesis benchmark that covers cases not covered by current NVS benchmarks, such as fully non-Lambertian scenes with 360-degree camera trajectories.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safe deployment of machine learning (ML) models in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging requires detecting inputs with characteristics not seen during training, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, to prevent unreliable predictions. Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit from access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test samples and the training data distribution to identify differences. State-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data after deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally stored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This is because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible due to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy constraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework that quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the training data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose Decentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of training and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only model parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and deployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target sample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on four medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound, histopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against existing methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD detection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers could provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of their training data for OOD detection services.

  Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous vehicles rely on detailed and accurate environmental information to operate safely. High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but their high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment. This challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which generate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are inherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To overcome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches have explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are significantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map construction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD maps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we incorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but additional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this way, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the dependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second, we introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element identifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up to +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP (+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR segmentation has emerged as an important task to enrich multimedia experiences and analysis. Range-view-based methods have gained popularity due to their high computational efficiency and compatibility with real-time deployment. However, their generalized performance under adverse weather conditions remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world environments. In this work, we identify and analyze the unique challenges that affect the generalization of range-view LiDAR segmentation in severe weather. To address these challenges, we propose a modular and lightweight framework that enhances robustness without altering the core architecture of existing models. Our method reformulates the initial stem block of standard range-view networks into two branches to process geometric attributes and reflectance intensity separately. Specifically, a Geometric Abnormality Suppression (GAS) module reduces the influence of weather-induced spatial noise, and a Reflectance Distortion Calibration (RDC) module corrects reflectance distortions through memory-guided adaptive instance normalization. The processed features are then fused and passed to the original segmentation pipeline. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks and baseline models demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization to adverse weather with minimal inference overhead, offering a practical and effective solution for real-world LiDAR segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object detection models typically rely on predefined categories, limiting their ability to identify novel objects in open-world scenarios. To overcome this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model, a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene. These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object compositing, the task of placing and harmonizing objects in images of diverse visual scenes, has become an important task in computer vision with the rise of generative models. However, existing datasets lack the diversity and scale required to comprehensively explore real-world scenarios. We introduce ORIDa (Object-centric Real-world Image Composition Dataset), a large-scale, real-captured dataset containing over 30,000 images featuring 200 unique objects, each of which is presented across varied positions and scenes. ORIDa has two types of data: factual-counterfactual sets and factual-only scenes. The factual-counterfactual sets consist of four factual images showing an object in different positions within a scene and a single counterfactual (or background) image of the scene without the object, resulting in five images per scene. The factual-only scenes include a single image containing an object in a specific context, expanding the variety of environments. To our knowledge, ORIDa is the first publicly available dataset with its scale and complexity for real-world image composition. Extensive analysis and experiments highlight the value of ORIDa as a resource for advancing further research in object compositing.

  In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in object detection performance. However, despite these advances, the detection performance for small objects is significantly inferior to that of large objects. Detecting small objects is one of the most challenging and important problems in computer vision. To improve the detection performance for small objects, we propose an optimal data augmentation method using Fast AutoAugment. Through our proposed method, we can quickly find optimal augmentation policies that can overcome degradation when detecting small objects, and we achieve a 20% performance improvement on the DOTA dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of biometric tasks, including face and body recognition. In this work, we adapt a ViT model pretrained on visible (VIS) imagery to the challenging problem of cross-spectral body recognition, which involves matching images captured in the visible and infrared (IR) domains. Recent ViT architectures have explored incorporating additional embeddings beyond traditional positional embeddings. Building on this idea, we integrate Side Information Embedding (SIE) and examine the impact of encoding domain and camera information to enhance cross-spectral matching. Surprisingly, our results show that encoding only camera information - without explicitly incorporating domain information - achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LLCM dataset. While occlusion handling has been extensively studied in visible-spectrum person re-identification (Re-ID), occlusions in visible-infrared (VI) Re-ID remain largely underexplored - primarily because existing VI-ReID datasets, such as LLCM, SYSU-MM01, and RegDB, predominantly feature full-body, unoccluded images. To address this gap, we analyze the impact of range-induced occlusions using the IARPA Janus Benchmark Multi-Domain Face (IJB-MDF) dataset, which provides a diverse set of visible and infrared images captured at various distances, enabling cross-range, cross-spectral evaluations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models (e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong" consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data, fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably, SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice. Code will be available atthis https URL.

  As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, MLLM-based virtual agents have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, existing benchmarks face significant limitations, including uncontrollable task complexity, extensive manual annotation with limited scenarios, and a lack of multidimensional evaluation. In response to these challenges, we introduce OmniBench, a self-generating, cross-platform, graph-based benchmark with an automated pipeline for synthesizing tasks of controllable complexity through subtask composition. To evaluate the diverse capabilities of virtual agents on the graph, we further present OmniEval, a multidimensional evaluation framework that includes subtask-level evaluation, graph-based metrics, and comprehensive tests across 10 capabilities. Our synthesized dataset contains 36k graph-structured tasks across 20 scenarios, achieving a 91\% human acceptance rate. Training on our graph-structured data shows that it can more efficiently guide agents compared to manually annotated data. We conduct multidimensional evaluations for various open-source and closed-source models, revealing their performance across various capabilities and paving the way for future advancements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation.

  Feature augmentation generates novel samples in the feature space, providing an effective way to enhance the generalization ability of learning algorithms with hyperbolic geometry. Most hyperbolic feature augmentation is confined to closed-environment, assuming the number of classes is fixed (\emph{i.e.}, seen classes) and generating features only for these classes. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic dual feature augmentation method for open-environment, which augments features for both seen and unseen classes in the hyperbolic space. To obtain a more precise approximation of the real data distribution for efficient training, (1) we adopt a neural ordinary differential equation module, enhanced by meta-learning, estimating the feature distributions of both seen and unseen classes; (2) we then introduce a regularizer to preserve the latent hierarchical structures of data in the hyperbolic space; (3) we also derive an upper bound for the hyperbolic dual augmentation loss, allowing us to train a hyperbolic model using infinite augmentations for seen and unseen classes. Extensive experiments on five open-environment tasks: class-incremental learning, few-shot open-set recognition, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and general image classification, demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of hyperbolic algorithms in open-environment.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for assisting clinicians in analyzing ophthalmic images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT). However, developing AI models often requires extensive annotation, and existing models tend to underperform on independent, unseen data. Foundation models (FMs), large AI models trained on vast unlabeled datasets, have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Nonetheless, available FMs for ophthalmology lack extensive validation, especially for segmentation tasks, and focus on a single imaging modality. In this context, we propose MIRAGE, a novel multimodal FM for the analysis of OCT and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation benchmark with OCT/SLO classification and segmentation tasks. The comparison with general and specialized FMs and segmentation methods shows the superiority of MIRAGE in both types of tasks, highlighting its suitability as a basis for the development of robust AI systems for retinal OCT image analysis. Both MIRAGE and the evaluation benchmark are publicly available:this https URL.

  To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wetlab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wetlab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wetlab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wetlab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapsethis https URL.

This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

  The parameter-efficient adaptation of the image-text pretraining model CLIP for video-text retrieval is a prominent area of research. While CLIP is focused on image-level vision-language matching, video-text retrieval demands comprehensive understanding at the video level. Three key discrepancies emerge in the transfer from image-level to video-level: vision, language, and alignment. However, existing methods mainly focus on vision while neglecting language and alignment. In this paper, we propose Discrepancy Reduction in Vision, Language, and Alignment (DiscoVLA), which simultaneously mitigates all three discrepancies. Specifically, we introduce Image-Video Features Fusion to integrate image-level and video-level features, effectively tackling both vision and language discrepancies. Additionally, we generate pseudo image captions to learn fine-grained image-level alignment. To mitigate alignment discrepancies, we propose Image-to-Video Alignment Distillation, which leverages image-level alignment knowledge to enhance video-level alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our DiscoVLA. In particular, on MSRVTT with CLIP (ViT-B/16), DiscoVLA outperforms previous methods by 1.5% in R@1, reaching a final score of 50.5% R@1. The code is available atthis https URL.

  Real-time reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from uncalibrated video streams is crucial for numerous real-world applications. However, existing methods struggle to jointly address three key challenges: 1) processing uncalibrated inputs in real time, 2) accurately modeling dynamic scene evolution, and 3) maintaining long-term stability and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce StreamSplat, the first fully feed-forward framework that transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations in an online manner, capable of recovering scene dynamics from temporally local observations. We propose two key technical innovations: a probabilistic sampling mechanism in the static encoder for 3DGS position prediction, and a bidirectional deformation field in the dynamic decoder that enables robust and efficient dynamic modeling. Extensive experiments on static and dynamic benchmarks demonstrate that StreamSplat consistently outperforms prior works in both reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling, while uniquely supporting online reconstruction of arbitrarily long video streams.

  Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.

  Medical ultrasonography is an essential imaging technique for examining superficial organs and tissues, including lymph nodes, breast, and thyroid. It employs high-frequency ultrasound waves to generate detailed images of the internal structures of the human body. However, manually contouring regions of interest in these images is a labor-intensive task that demands expertise and often results in inconsistent interpretations among individuals. Vision-language foundation models, which have excelled in various computer vision applications, present new opportunities for enhancing ultrasound image analysis. Yet, their performance is hindered by the significant differences between natural and medical imaging domains. This research seeks to overcome these challenges by developing domain adaptation methods for vision-language foundation models. In this study, we explore the fine-tuning pipeline for vision-language foundation models by utilizing large language model as text refiner with special-designed adaptation strategies and task-driven heads. Our approach has been extensively evaluated on six ultrasound datasets and two tasks: segmentation and classification. The experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the performance of vision-language foundation models for ultrasound image analysis, and outperform the existing state-of-the-art vision-language and pure foundation models.

  The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methodologies.

Additionally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for assessing these tasks, with each task featuring 750 images and tailored evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments reveal that current VLMs face significant challenges in achieving satisfactory performance, high-lighting the difficulties of effective spatiotemporal understanding. Overall, the Video-CoT dataset and benchmark open new avenues for research in multimedia understanding and support future innovations in intelligent systems requiring advanced video analysis capabilities.

  To address key limitations in human-object interaction (HOI) video generation -- specifically the reliance on curated motion data, limited generalization to novel objects/scenarios, and restricted accessibility -- we introduce HunyuanVideo-HOMA, a weakly conditioned multimodal-driven framework. HunyuanVideo-HOMA enhances controllability and reduces dependency on precise inputs through sparse, decoupled motion guidance. It encodes appearance and motion signals into the dual input space of a multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT), fusing them within a shared context space to synthesize temporally consistent and physically plausible interactions. To optimize training, we integrate a parameter-space HOI adapter initialized from pretrained MMDiT weights, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient adaptation, and a facial cross-attention adapter for anatomically accurate audio-driven lip synchronization. Extensive experiments confirm state-of-the-art performance in interaction naturalness and generalization under weak supervision. Finally, HunyuanVideo-HOMA demonstrates versatility in text-conditioned generation and interactive object manipulation, supported by a user-friendly demo interface.

  Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast, and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns, which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'') to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution $p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

  Anomaly detection (AD) is a task that distinguishes normal and abnormal data, which is important for applying automation technologies of the manufacturing facilities. For MVTec dataset that is a representative AD dataset for industrial environment, many recent works have shown remarkable performances. However, the existing anomaly detection works have a limitation of showing good performance for fully-aligned datasets only, unlike real-world industrial environments. To solve this limitation, we propose HomographyAD, a novel deep anomaly detection methodology based on the ImageNet-pretrained network, which is specially designed for actual industrial dataset. Specifically, we first suggest input foreground alignment using the deep homography estimation method. In addition, we fine-tune the model by self homography learning to learn additional shape information from normal samples. Finally, we conduct anomaly detection based on the measure of how far the feature of test sample is from the distribution of the extracted normal features. By applying our proposed method to various existing AD approaches, we show performance enhancement through extensive experiments.

In this paper, we introduce Landsat-Bench, a suite of three benchmarks with Landsat imagery that adapt from existing remote sensing datasets -- EuroSAT-L, BigEarthNet-L, and LC100-L. We establish baseline and standardized evaluation methods across both common architectures and Landsat foundation models pretrained on the SSL4EO-L dataset. Notably, we provide evidence that SSL4EO-L pretrained GFMs extract better representations for downstream tasks in comparison to ImageNet, including performance gains of +4% OA and +5.1% mAP on EuroSAT-L and BigEarthNet-L.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) for point cloud pre-training has become a cornerstone for many 3D vision tasks, enabling effective learning from large-scale unannotated data. At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.

  Semantic segmentation in remote sensing images is crucial for various applications, yet its performance is heavily reliant on large-scale, high-quality pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS methods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization. We propose that Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets, possess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this distribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this, we introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework that leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide semi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs multiple frozen VFMs (\textit{e.g.}, DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing feature-level distillation to align student features with their robust representations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled knowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments on three challenging remote sensing datasets (ISPRS Potsdam, LoveDA, and DeepGlobe) demonstrate that RS-MTDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our method outperforms existing approaches across various label ratios on LoveDA and secures the highest IoU in the majority of semantic categories. These results underscore the efficacy of multi-teacher VFM guidance in significantly enhancing both generalization and semantic understanding for remote sensing segmentation. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed module.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Within the family of convolutional neural networks, InceptionNeXt has shown excellent competitiveness in image classification and a number of downstream tasks. Built on parallel one-dimensional strip convolutions, however, it suffers from limited ability of capturing spatial dependencies along different dimensions and fails to fully explore spatial modeling in local neighborhood. Besides, inherent locality constraints of convolution operations are detrimental to effective global context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel backbone architecture termed InceptionMamba in this study. More specifically, the traditional one-dimensional strip convolutions are replaced by orthogonal band convolutions in our InceptionMamba to achieve cohesive spatial modeling. Furthermore, global contextual modeling can be achieved via a bottleneck Mamba module, facilitating enhanced cross-channel information fusion and enlarged receptive field. Extensive evaluations on classification and various downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed InceptionMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter and computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.

  High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense self-supervised learning has shown great promise for learning pixel- and patch-level representations, but extending it to videos remains challenging due to the complexity of motion dynamics. Existing approaches struggle as they rely on static augmentations that fail under object deformations, occlusions, and camera movement, leading to inconsistent feature learning over time. We propose a motion-guided self-supervised learning framework that clusters dense point tracks to learn spatiotemporally consistent representations. By leveraging an off-the-shelf point tracker, we extract long-range motion trajectories and optimize feature clustering through a momentum-encoder-based optimal transport mechanism. To ensure temporal coherence, we propagate cluster assignments along tracked points, enforcing feature consistency across views despite viewpoint changes. Integrating motion as an implicit supervisory signal, our method learns representations that generalize across frames, improving robustness in dynamic scenes and challenging occlusion scenarios. By initializing from strong image-pretrained models and leveraging video data for training, we improve state-of-the-art by 1% to 6% on six image and video datasets and four evaluation benchmarks. The implementation is publicly available at our GitHub repository:this https URL

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown exceptional performance in multimodal tasks, but their effectiveness in complex visual reasoning is still constrained, especially when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting techniques. In this paper, we propose VReST, a novel training-free approach that enhances Reasoning in LVLMs through Monte Carlo Tree Search and Self-Reward mechanisms. VReST meticulously traverses the reasoning landscape by establishing a search tree, where each node encapsulates a reasoning step, and each path delineates a comprehensive reasoning sequence. Our innovative multimodal Self-Reward mechanism assesses the quality of reasoning steps by integrating the utility of sub-questions, answer correctness, and the relevance of vision-language clues, all without the need for additional models. VReST surpasses current prompting methods and secures state-of-the-art performance across three multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, it substantiates the efficacy of test-time scaling laws in multimodal tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Canada experienced in 2023 one of the most severe wildfire seasons in recent history, causing damage across ecosystems, destroying communities, and emitting large quantities of CO2. This extreme wildfire season is symptomatic of a climate-change-induced increase in the length and severity of the fire season that affects the boreal ecosystem. Therefore, it is critical to empower wildfire management in boreal communities with better mitigation solutions. Wildfire probability maps represent an important tool for understanding the likelihood of wildfire occurrence and the potential severity of future wildfires. The massive increase in the availability of Earth observation data has enabled the development of deep learning-based wildfire forecasting models, aiming at providing precise wildfire probability maps at different spatial and temporal scales. A main limitation of such methods is their reliance on coarse-resolution environmental drivers and satellite products, leading to wildfire occurrence prediction of reduced resolution, typically around $\sim 0.1$¬∞. This paper presents a benchmark dataset: CanadaFireSat, and baseline methods for high-resolution: 100 m wildfire forecasting across Canada, leveraging multi-modal data from high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images (Sentinel-2 L1C), mid-resolution satellite products (MODIS), and environmental factors (ERA5 reanalysis data). Our experiments consider two major deep learning architectures. We observe that using multi-modal temporal inputs outperforms single-modal temporal inputs across all metrics, achieving a peak performance of 60.3% in F1 score for the 2023 wildfire season, a season never seen during model training. This demonstrates the potential of multi-modal deep learning models for wildfire forecasting at high-resolution and continental scale.

  Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.

  Multimodal models like LLaVA-1.5 achieve state-of-the-art visual understanding through visual instruction tuning on multitask datasets, enabling strong instruction-following and multimodal performance. However, multitask learning faces challenges such as task balancing, requiring careful adjustment of data proportions, and expansion costs, where new tasks risk catastrophic forgetting and need costly retraining. Continual learning provides a promising alternative to acquiring new knowledge incrementally while preserving existing capabilities. However, current methods prioritize task-specific performance, neglecting base model degradation from overfitting to specific instructions, which undermines general capabilities. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method with two modifications on LLaVA-1.5: spectral-aware consolidation for improved task balance and unsupervised inquiry regularization to prevent base model degradation. We evaluate both general and task-specific performance across continual pretraining and fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-c consistently enhances standard benchmark performance and preserves general capabilities. For the first time, we show that task-by-task continual learning can achieve results that match or surpass multitask joint learning. The code will be publicly released.

  Achieving consistent color reproduction across multiple cameras is essential for seamless image fusion and Image Processing Pipeline (ISP) compatibility in modern devices, but it is a challenging task due to variations in sensors and optics. Existing raw-to-raw conversion methods face limitations such as poor adaptability to changing illumination, high computational costs, or impractical requirements such as simultaneous camera operation and overlapping fields-of-view. We introduce the Neural Physical Model (NPM), a lightweight, physically-informed approach that simulates raw images under specified illumination to estimate transformations between devices. The NPM effectively adapts to varying illumination conditions, can be initialized with physical measurements, and supports training with or without paired data. Experiments on public datasets like NUS and BeyondRGB demonstrate that NPM outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, providing robust chromatic consistency across different sensors and optical systems.

  Video memorability refers to the ability of videos to be recalled after viewing, playing a crucial role in creating content that remains memorable. Existing models typically focus on extracting multimodal features to predict video memorability scores but often fail to fully utilize motion cues. The representation of motion features is compromised during the fine-tuning phase of the motion feature extractor due to a lack of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce the Text-Motion Cross-modal Contrastive Loss (TMCCL), a multimodal video memorability prediction model designed to enhance the representation of motion features. We tackle the challenge of improving motion feature representation by leveraging text description similarities across videos to establish positive and negative motion sample sets for a given target. This enhancement allows the model to learn similar feature representations for semantically related motion content, resulting in more accurate memorability predictions. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two video memorability prediction datasets. Moreover, the potential applications of video memorability prediction have been underexplored. To address this gap, we present Memorability Weighted Correction for Video Summarization (MWCVS), using video memorability prediction to reduce subjectivity in video summarization labels. Experimental results on two video summarization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MWCVS, showcasing the promising applications of video memorability prediction.

  Humans intuitively perceive object shape and orientation from a single image, guided by strong priors about canonical poses. However, existing 3D generative models often produce misaligned results due to inconsistent training data, limiting their usability in downstream tasks. To address this gap, we introduce the task of orientation-aligned 3D object generation: producing 3D objects from single images with consistent orientations across categories. To facilitate this, we construct Objaverse-OA, a dataset of 14,832 orientation-aligned 3D models spanning 1,008 categories. Leveraging Objaverse-OA, we fine-tune two representative 3D generative models based on multi-view diffusion and 3D variational autoencoder frameworks to produce aligned objects that generalize well to unseen objects across various categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over post-hoc alignment approaches. Furthermore, we showcase downstream applications enabled by our aligned object generation, including zero-shot object orientation estimation via analysis-by-synthesis and efficient arrow-based object rotation manipulation.

  We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation. Recent learning methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can provide improved reconstruction results.

  Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

  In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation, dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6% mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

  Several variants of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have significantly improved the accuracy of synthesized images and surface reconstruction of 3D scenes/objects. In all of these methods, a key characteristic is that none can train the neural network with every possible input data, specifically, every pixel and potential 3D point along the projection rays due to scalability issues. While vanilla NeRFs uniformly sample both the image pixels and 3D points along the projection rays, some variants focus only on guiding the sampling of the 3D points along the projection rays. In this paper, we leverage the implicit surface representation of the foreground scene and model a probability density function in a 3D image projection space to achieve a more targeted sampling of the rays toward regions of interest, resulting in improved rendering. Additionally, a new surface reconstruction loss is proposed for improved performance. This new loss fully explores the proposed 3D image projection space model and incorporates near-to-surface and empty space components. By integrating our novel sampling strategy and novel loss into current state-of-the-art neural implicit surface renderers, we achieve more accurate and detailed 3D reconstructions and improved image rendering, especially for the regions of interest in any given scene.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This work proposes SAMSelect, an algorithm to obtain a salient three-channel visualization for multispectral images. We develop SAMSelect and show its use for marine scientists visually interpreting floating marine debris in Sentinel-2 imagery. These debris are notoriously difficult to visualize due to their compositional heterogeneity in medium-resolution imagery. Out of these difficulties, a visual interpretation of imagery showing marine debris remains a common practice by domain experts, who select bands and spectral indices on a case-by-case basis informed by common practices and heuristics. SAMSelect selects the band or index combination that achieves the best classification accuracy on a small annotated dataset through the Segment Anything Model. Its central assumption is that the three-channel visualization achieves the most accurate segmentation results also provide good visual information for photo-interpretation.We evaluate SAMSelect in three Sentinel-2 scenes containing generic marine debris in Accra, Ghana, and Durban, South Africa, and deployed plastic targets from the Plastic Litter Project. This reveals the potential of new previously unused band combinations (e.g., a normalized difference index of B8, B2), which demonstrate improved performance compared to literature-based indices. We describe the algorithm in this paper and provide an open-source code repository that will be helpful for domain scientists doing visual photo interpretation, especially in the marine field.

  Deep Learning requires large amounts of data to train models that work well. In data-deficient settings, performance can be degraded. We investigate which Deep Learning methods benefit training models in a data-deficient setting, by organizing the "VIPriors: Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning" workshop series, featuring four editions of data-impaired challenges. These challenges address the problem of training deep learning models for computer vision tasks with limited data. Participants are limited to training models from scratch using a low number of training samples and are not allowed to use any form of transfer learning. We aim to stimulate the development of novel approaches that incorporate prior knowledge to improve the data efficiency of deep learning models. Successful challenge entries make use of large model ensembles that mix Transformers and CNNs, as well as heavy data augmentation. Novel prior knowledge-based methods contribute to success in some entries.

  Adversarial Training (AT) is widely recognized as an effective approach to enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Neural Networks. As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has shown outstanding performance in enhancing the robustness of small models. However, both AT and ARD face robust fairness issue: these models tend to display strong adversarial robustness against some classes (easy classes) while demonstrating weak adversarial robustness against others (hard classes). This paper explores the underlying factors of this problem and points out the smoothness degree of soft labels for different classes significantly impacts the robust fairness from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above exploration, we propose Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) within the Knowledge Distillation framework to enhance the adversarial robust fairness. Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes, which is accomplished by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of teacher's soft labels during the training process, and the adjustment is managed by assigning varying temperatures to different classes. Additionally, as a label-based approach, ABSLD is highly adaptable and can be integrated with the sample-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the comprehensive performance of robustness and fairness.

  _Guyang Zhang, Waleed Abdulla_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction, multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles: scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead, and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models, illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining, or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for next-generation HSI applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables intelligent agents to navigate environments by integrating visual perception and natural language instructions, yet faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of fine-grained cross-modal alignment annotations. Existing datasets primarily focus on global instruction-trajectory matching, neglecting sub-instruction-level and entity-level alignments critical for accurate navigation action decision-making. To address this limitation, we propose FCA-NIG, a generative framework that automatically constructs navigation instructions with dual-level fine-grained cross-modal annotations. In this framework, an augmented trajectory is first divided into sub-trajectories, which are then processed through GLIP-based landmark detection, crafted instruction construction, OFA-Speaker based R2R-like instruction generation, and CLIP-powered entity selection, generating sub-instruction-trajectory pairs with entity-landmark annotations. Finally, these sub-pairs are aggregated to form a complete instruction-trajectory pair. The framework generates the FCA-R2R dataset, the first large-scale augmentation dataset featuring precise sub-instruction-sub-trajectory and entity-landmark alignments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with FCA-R2R significantly improves the performance of multiple state-of-the-art VLN agents, including SF, EnvDrop, RecBERT, and HAMT. Incorporating sub-instruction-trajectory alignment enhances agents' state awareness and decision accuracy, while entity-landmark alignment further boosts navigation performance and generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness of FCA-NIG in generating high-quality, scalable training data without manual annotation, advancing fine-grained cross-modal learning in complex navigation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, object detection models have witnessed notable performance improvements, particularly with transformer-based models. However, new objects frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-level representations have become a central focus in enhancing AI transparency and control, shifting attention from individual neurons or circuits to structured semantic directions that align with human-interpretable concepts. Motivated by the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), we propose the Input-Space Linearity Hypothesis (ISLH), which posits that concept-aligned directions originate in the input space and are selectively amplified with increasing depth. We then introduce the Spectral Principal Path (SPP) framework, which formalizes how deep networks progressively distill linear representations along a small set of dominant spectral directions. Building on this framework, we further demonstrate the multimodal robustness of these representations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work advances a structured theory of representation formation in deep networks, paving the way for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

  _Xijun Wang, Xin Li, Bingchen Li, Zhibo Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visual localization remains challenging in dynamic environments where fluctuating lighting, adverse weather, and moving objects disrupt appearance cues. Despite advances in feature representation, current absolute pose regression methods struggle to maintain consistency under varying conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that synergistically combines multi-scale feature learning with semantic scene understanding. Our approach employs a hierarchical Transformer with cross-scale attention to fuse geometric details and contextual cues, preserving spatial precision while adapting to environmental changes. We improve the performance of this architecture with semantic supervision via neural scene representation during training, guiding the network to learn view-invariant features that encode persistent structural information while suppressing complex environmental interference. Experiments on TartanAir demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pose regression methods in challenging scenarios with dynamic objects, illumination changes, and occlusions. Our findings show that integrating multi-scale processing with semantic guidance offers a promising strategy for robust visual localization in real-world dynamic environments.

  _Zhiyi Zhu, Xiaoyu Wu, Zihao Liu, Linlin Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained models have demonstrated impressive success in many modalities such as language and vision. Recent works facilitate the pretraining paradigm in imaging research. Transients are a novel modality, which are captured for an object as photon counts versus arrival times using a precisely time-resolved sensor. In particular for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, transients of hidden objects are measured beyond the sensor's direct line of sight. Using NLOS transients, the majority of previous works optimize volume density or surfaces to reconstruct the hidden objects and do not transfer priors learned from datasets. In this work, we present a masked autoencoder for modeling transient imaging, or MARMOT, to facilitate NLOS applications. Our MARMOT is a self-supervised model pretrianed on massive and diverse NLOS transient datasets. Using a Transformer-based encoder-decoder, MARMOT learns features from partially masked transients via a scanning pattern mask (SPM), where the unmasked subset is functionally equivalent to arbitrary sampling, and predicts full measurements. Pretrained on TransVerse-a synthesized transient dataset of 500K 3D models-MARMOT adapts to downstream imaging tasks using direct feature transfer or decoder finetuning. Comprehensive experiments are carried out in comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the efficiency of our MARMOT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent text-to-video (T2V) models have demonstrated strong capabilities in producing high-quality, dynamic videos. To improve the visual controllability, recent works have considered fine-tuning pre-trained T2V models to support image-to-video (I2V) generation. However, such adaptation frequently suppresses motion dynamics of generated outputs, resulting in more static videos compared to their T2V counterparts. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon and identify that it stems from the premature exposure to high-frequency details in the input image, which biases the sampling process toward a shortcut trajectory that overfits to the static appearance of the reference image. To address this, we propose adaptive low-pass guidance (ALG), a simple fix to the I2V model sampling procedure to generate more dynamic videos without compromising per-frame image quality. Specifically, ALG adaptively modulates the frequency content of the conditioning image by applying low-pass filtering at the early stage of denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALG significantly improves the temporal dynamics of generated videos, while preserving image fidelity and text alignment. Especially, under VBench-I2V test suite, ALG achieves an average improvement of 36% in dynamic degree without a significant drop in video quality or image fidelity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of visual instruction tuning and other post-training techniques has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in visual understanding, enriching Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with more comprehensive visual language datasets. However, the effectiveness of VLMs is highly dependent on large-scale, high-quality datasets that ensure precise recognition and accurate reasoning. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) noisy alignments between images and the corresponding text, which leads to misinterpretation, and (2) ambiguous or misleading text, which obscures visual content. To address these challenges, we propose SCALE (Single modality data quality and Cross modality Alignment Evaluation), a novel quality-driven data selection pipeline for VLM instruction tuning datasets. Specifically, SCALE integrates a cross-modality assessment framework that first assigns each data entry to its appropriate vision-language task, generates general and task-specific captions (covering scenes, objects, style, etc.), and evaluates the alignment, clarity, task rarity, text coherence, and image clarity of each entry based on the generated captions. We reveal that: (1) current unimodal quality assessment methods evaluate one modality while overlooking the rest, which can underestimate samples essential for specific tasks and discard the lower-quality instances that help build model robustness; and (2) appropriately generated image captions provide an efficient way to transfer the image-text multimodal task into a unified text modality.

  Despite significant advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the performance of existing VLMs remains hindered by object hallucination, a critical challenge to achieving accurate visual understanding. To address this issue, we propose SECOND: Selective and Contrastive Decoding, a novel approach that enables VLMs to effectively leverage multi-scale visual information with an object-centric manner, closely aligning with human visual perception. SECOND progressively selects and integrates multi-scale visual information, facilitating a more precise interpretation of images. By contrasting these visual information iteratively, SECOND significantly reduces perceptual hallucinations and outperforms a wide range of benchmarks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments highlight the largely unexplored potential of multi-scale application in VLMs, showing that prioritizing and contrasting across scales outperforms existing methods.

  When shooting electronic screens, moir√© patterns usually appear in captured images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir√©ing methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir√©. To address the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir√©ing (DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir√© removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir√© exists in the W image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into an existing demoir√©ing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are available atthis https URL.

  Different medical imaging modalities capture diagnostic information at varying spatial resolutions, from coarse global patterns to fine-grained localized structures. However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the medical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction, overlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a modular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically adapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type, which routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches trained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate over feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling spatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework produces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions, without requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results on diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and retrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of modality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language systems.

  _Huixuan Zhang, Junzhe Zhang, Xiaojun Wan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models, classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work, we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In racket sports, such as tennis, locating the ball's position at impact is important in clarifying player and equipment characteristics, thereby aiding in personalized equipment design. High-speed cameras are used to measure the impact location; however, their excessive memory consumption limits prolonged scene capture, and manual digitization for position detection is time-consuming and prone to human error. These limitations make it difficult to effectively capture the entire playing scene, hindering the ability to analyze the player's performance. We propose a method for locating the tennis ball impact on the racket in real time using an event camera. Event cameras efficiently measure brightness changes (called `events') with microsecond accuracy under high-speed motion while using lower memory consumption. These cameras enable users to continuously monitor their performance over extended periods. Our method consists of three identification steps: time range of swing, timing at impact, and contours of ball and racket. Conventional computer vision techniques are utilized along with an original event-based processing to detect the timing at impact (PATS: the amount of polarity asymmetry in time symmetry). The results of the experiments were within the permissible range for measuring tennis players' performance. Moreover, the computation time was sufficiently short for real-time applications.

  _Guandong Li, Mengxia Ye_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks face several challenges in hyperspectral image classification, including high-dimensional data, sparse distribution of ground objects, and spectral redundancy, which often lead to classification overfitting and limited generalization capability. To more effectively extract and fuse spatial context with fine spectral information in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper proposes a novel network architecture called STNet. The core advantage of STNet stems from the dual innovative design of its Spatial-Spectral Transformer module: first, the fundamental explicit decoupling of spatial and spectral attention ensures targeted capture of key information in HSI; second, two functionally distinct gating mechanisms perform intelligent regulation at both the fusion level of attention flows (adaptive attention fusion gating) and the internal level of feature transformation (GFFN). This characteristic demonstrates superior feature extraction and fusion capabilities compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, while reducing overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. STNet enhances model representation capability without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.

  Reflection removal technology plays a crucial role in photography and computer vision applications. However, existing techniques are hindered by the lack of high-quality in-the-wild datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for collecting reflection datasets from a fresh perspective.

Following this paradigm, we collect a Real-world, Diverse, and Pixel-aligned dataset (named OpenRR-1k dataset), which contains 1,000 high-quality transmission-reflection image pairs collected in the wild. Through the analysis of several reflection removal methods and benchmark evaluation experiments on our dataset, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving robustness in challenging real-world environments.

  Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses, that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter sizes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We investigate 17 benchmarks (e.g. SugarCREPE, VALSE) commonly used for measuring compositional understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). We scrutinize design choices in their construction, including data source (e.g. MS-COCO) and curation procedures (e.g. constructing negative images/captions), uncovering several inherent biases across most benchmarks. We find that blind heuristics (e.g. token-length, log-likelihood under a language model) perform on par with CLIP models, indicating that these benchmarks do not effectively measure compositional understanding. We demonstrate that the underlying factor is a distribution asymmetry between positive and negative images/captions, induced by the benchmark construction procedures. To mitigate these issues, we provide a few key recommendations for constructing more robust vision-language compositional understanding benchmarks, that would be less prone to such simple attacks.

  Semantic correspondence (SC) aims to establish semantically meaningful matches across different instances of an object category. We illustrate how recent supervised SC methods remain limited in their ability to generalize beyond sparsely annotated training keypoints, effectively acting as keypoint detectors. To address this, we propose a novel approach for learning dense correspondences by lifting 2D keypoints into a canonical 3D space using monocular depth estimation. Our method constructs a continuous canonical manifold that captures object geometry without requiring explicit 3D supervision or camera annotations. Additionally, we introduce SPair-U, an extension of SPair-71k with novel keypoint annotations, to better assess generalization. Experiments not only demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms supervised baselines on unseen keypoints, highlighting its effectiveness in learning robust correspondences, but that unsupervised baselines outperform supervised counterparts when generalized across different datasets.

  In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the remote monitoring of the surface area of wetlands. However, these models require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem, self-supervised training methods have been deployed to train models without using annotated data. In this paper we use a combination of deep clustering and negative sampling to train a model to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water from land without the use of any manual annotations. Furthermore, we implement an ensemble version of the model to reduce variance and improve performance. Compared to a single fully-supervised model using the same architecture, our ensemble of self-supervised models achieves a 0.02 improvement in the Intersection Over Union metric over our test dataset.

  Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12 different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

  Monocular 3D reconstruction methods and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive results on standard benchmarks, yet their true understanding of geometric properties remains unclear. We introduce GIQ , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the geometric reasoning capabilities of vision and vision-language foundation models. GIQ comprises synthetic and real-world images of 224 diverse polyhedra - including Platonic, Archimedean, Johnson, and Catalan solids, as well as stellations and compound shapes - covering varying levels of complexity and symmetry. Through systematic experiments involving monocular 3D reconstruction, 3D symmetry detection, mental rotation tests, and zero-shot shape classification tasks, we reveal significant shortcomings in current models. State-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms trained on extensive 3D datasets struggle to reconstruct even basic geometric forms accurately. While foundation models effectively detect specific 3D symmetry elements via linear probing, they falter significantly in tasks requiring detailed geometric differentiation, such as mental rotation. Moreover, advanced vision-language assistants exhibit remarkably low accuracy on complex polyhedra, systematically misinterpreting basic properties like face geometry, convexity, and compound structures. GIQ is publicly available, providing a structured platform to highlight and address critical gaps in geometric intelligence, facilitating future progress in robust, geometry-aware representation learning.

  _Antoni Nowinowski, Krzysztof Krawiec_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study builds on the architecture of the Disentangler of Visual Priors (DVP), a type of autoencoder that learns to interpret scenes by decomposing the perceived objects into independent visual aspects of shape, size, orientation, and color appearance. These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which control a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that the model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In this study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects in a scene. We also exploit the interpretability of its latent by using the decoder to sample additional training examples and devising alternative training modes that rely on loss functions defined not only in the image space, but also in the latent space. This significantly facilitates training, which is otherwise challenging due to the presence of extensive plateaus in the image-space reconstruction loss. To examine the performance of this approach, we propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the previously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We compare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and demonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to decompose overlapping objects. We also analyze the gradients induced by the considered loss functions, explain how they impact the efficacy of training, and discuss the limitations of differentiable rendering in autoencoders and the ways in which they can be addressed.

  Scene-Graph Generation (SGG) seeks to recognize objects in an image and distill their salient pairwise relationships. Most methods depend on dataset-specific supervision to learn the variety of interactions, restricting their usefulness in open-world settings, involving novel objects and/or relations. Even methods that leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically require benchmark-specific fine-tuning. We introduce Open-World SGG, a training-free, efficient, model-agnostic framework that taps directly into the pretrained knowledge of VLMs to produce scene graphs with zero additional learning. Casting SGG as a zero-shot structured-reasoning problem, our method combines multimodal prompting, embedding alignment, and a lightweight pair-refinement strategy, enabling inference over unseen object vocabularies and relation sets. To assess this setting, we formalize an Open-World evaluation protocol that measures performance when no SGG-specific data have been observed either in terms of objects and relations. Experiments on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and the Panoptic Scene Graph (PSG) dataset demonstrate the capacity of pretrained VLMs to perform relational understanding without task-level training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training, experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained, surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill. Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions. Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes, establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

  Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

  Popular text-to-image (T2I) systems are trained on web-scraped data, which is heavily Amero and Euro-centric, underrepresenting the cultures of the Global South. To analyze these biases, we introduce CuRe, a novel and scalable benchmarking and scoring suite for cultural representativeness that leverages the marginal utility of attribute specification to T2I systems as a proxy for human judgments. Our CuRe benchmark dataset has a novel categorical hierarchy built from the crowdsourced Wikimedia knowledge graph, with 300 cultural artifacts across 32 cultural subcategories grouped into six broad cultural axes (food, art, fashion, architecture, celebrations, and people). Our dataset's categorical hierarchy enables CuRe scorers to evaluate T2I systems by analyzing their response to increasing the informativeness of text conditioning, enabling fine-grained cultural comparisons. We empirically observe much stronger correlations of our class of scorers to human judgments of perceptual similarity, image-text alignment, and cultural diversity across image encoders (SigLIP 2, AIMV2 and DINOv2), vision-language models (OpenCLIP, SigLIP 2, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and state-of-the-art text-to-image systems, including three variants of Stable Diffusion (1.5, XL, 3.5 Large), FLUX.1 [dev], Ideogram 2.0, and DALL-E 3.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although end-to-end autonomous driving has made remarkable progress, its performance degrades significantly in rare and long-tail scenarios. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by leveraging the rich world knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but these methods suffer from several limitations: (1) a significant domain gap between the pre-training data of VLMs and real-world driving data, (2) a dimensionality mismatch between the discrete language space and the continuous action space, and (3) imitation learning tends to capture the average behavior present in the dataset, which may be suboptimal even dangerous. In this paper, we propose ReCogDrive, an autonomous driving system that integrates VLMs with diffusion planner, which adopts a three-stage paradigm for training. In the first stage, we use a large-scale driving question-answering datasets to train the VLMs, mitigating the domain discrepancy between generic content and real-world driving scenarios. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion-based planner to perform imitation learning, mapping representations from the latent language space to continuous driving actions. Finally, we fine-tune the diffusion planner using reinforcement learning with NAVSIM non-reactive simulator, enabling the model to generate safer, more human-like driving trajectories. We evaluate our approach on the planning-oriented NAVSIM benchmark, achieving a PDMS of 89.6 and setting a new state-of-the-art that surpasses the previous vision-only SOTA by 5.6 PDMS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

  Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video large language models have not yet been widely deployed, largely due to their tendency to hallucinate. Typical benchmarks for Video-LLMs rely simply on multiple-choice questions. Unfortunately, VideoLLMs hallucinate far more aggressively on freeform text generation tasks like video captioning than they do on multiple choice verification tasks. To address this weakness, we propose ARGUS, a VideoLLM benchmark that measures freeform video captioning performance. By comparing VideoLLM outputs to human ground truth captions, ARGUS quantifies dual metrics. First, we measure the rate of hallucinations in the form of incorrect statements about video content or temporal relationships. Second, we measure the rate at which the model omits important descriptive details. Together, these dual metrics form a comprehensive view of video captioning performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Saliency methods are widely used to visualize which input features are deemed relevant to a model's prediction. However, their visual plausibility can obscure critical limitations. In this work, we propose a diagnostic test for class sensitivity: a method's ability to distinguish between competing class labels on the same input. Through extensive experiments, we show that many widely used saliency methods produce nearly identical explanations regardless of the class label, calling into question their reliability. We find that class-insensitive behavior persists across architectures and datasets, suggesting the failure mode is structural rather than model-specific. Motivated by these findings, we introduce CASE, a contrastive explanation method that isolates features uniquely discriminative for the predicted class. We evaluate CASE using the proposed diagnostic and a perturbation-based fidelity test, and show that it produces faithful and more class-specific explanations than existing methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) have emerged as powerful generative tools, capable of synthesizing high-quality spatiotemporal content. Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal losss, inverse focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC), have been proposed in the literature and claims have been made in relation to their calibration properties. However, focal loss and inverse focal loss propose vastly different weighting schemes. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a principled connection between these reweighting schemes and calibration errors. We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing a regularized variant of the AURC naturally leads to improved calibration. This regularized AURC shares a similar reweighting strategy with inverse focal loss, lending support to the idea that focal loss is less principled when calibration is a desired outcome. Direct AURC optimization offers greater flexibility through the choice of confidence score functions (CSFs). To enable gradient-based optimization, we introduce a differentiable formulation of the regularized AURC using the SoftRank technique. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our AURC-based loss achieves competitive class-wise calibration performance across a range of datasets and model architectures.

  We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  State Space models (SSMs) such as PointMamba enable efficient feature extraction for point cloud self-supervised learning with linear complexity, outperforming Transformers in computational efficiency. However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

  Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

  Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study, we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical image segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success, prompting increased interest in expanding their generative capabilities beyond general text into domain-specific areas. This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms prior autoregressive methods and existing LLM baselines.

  Humans naturally understand 3D spatial relationships, enabling complex reasoning like predicting collisions of vehicles from different directions. Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction. Our project page is available at:this https URL

  Despite recent advances on multi-modal models, 3D spatial reasoning remains a challenging task for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models. Recent studies explore data-driven approaches and achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance by fine-tuning models on 3D-related visual question-answering data. However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit manner and often fail on questions that are trivial to humans, even with long chain-of-thought reasoning. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that addresses 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between multiple stages--3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and improves the generalization ability to novel question types. Furthermore, by analyzing the explicit 3D representations in multi-step reasoning traces of SpatialReasoner, we study the factual errors and identify key shortcomings of current LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieves improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming Gemini 2.0 by 9.2% on 3DSRBench, and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.

  The field of monocular depth estimation is continually evolving with the advent of numerous innovative models and extensions. However, research on monocular depth estimation methods specifically for underwater scenes remains limited, compounded by a scarcity of relevant data and methodological support. This paper proposes a novel approach to address the existing challenges in current monocular depth estimation methods for underwater environments. We construct an economically efficient dataset suitable for underwater scenarios by employing multi-view depth estimation to generate supervisory signals and corresponding enhanced underwater images. we introduces a texture-depth fusion module, designed according to the underwater optical imaging principles, which aims to effectively exploit and integrate depth information from texture cues. Experimental results on the FLSea dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of models in underwater settings. This work offers a cost-effective solution for monocular underwater depth estimation and holds considerable promise for practical applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing spatially and temporally coherent videos from time-varying measurements is a fundamental challenge in many scientific domains. A major difficulty arises from the sparsity of measurements, which hinders accurate recovery of temporal dynamics. Existing image diffusion-based methods rely on extracting temporal consistency directly from measurements, limiting their effectiveness on scientific tasks with high spatiotemporal uncertainty. We address this difficulty by proposing a plug-and-play framework that incorporates a learned spatiotemporal diffusion prior. Due to its plug-and-play nature, our framework can be flexibly applied to different video inverse problems without the need for task-specific design and temporal heuristics. We further demonstrate that a spatiotemporal diffusion model can be trained efficiently with limited video data. We validate our approach on two challenging scientific video reconstruction tasks: black hole video reconstruction and dynamic MRI. While baseline methods struggle to provide temporally coherent reconstructions, our approach achieves significantly improved recovery of the spatiotemporal structure of the underlying ground truth videos.

  Retrieving images from the same location as a given query is an important component of multiple computer vision tasks, like Visual Place Recognition, Landmark Retrieval, Visual Localization, 3D reconstruction, and SLAM. However, existing solutions are built to specifically work for one of these tasks, and are known to fail when the requirements slightly change or when they meet out-of-distribution data. In this paper we combine a variety of existing methods, training techniques, and datasets to train a retrieval model, called MegaLoc, that is performant on multiple tasks. We find that MegaLoc (1) achieves state of the art on a large number of Visual Place Recognition datasets, (2) impressive results on common Landmark Retrieval datasets, and (3) sets a new state of the art for Visual Localization on the LaMAR datasets, where we only changed the retrieval method to the existing localization pipeline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps on the complex R2R-Habitat instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.

  Decoding visual images from brain activity has significant potential for advancing brain-computer interaction and enhancing the understanding of human perception. Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive experiments confirm consistent performance improvements across diverse EEG architectures, image encoders, alignment methods, participants, and brain imaging modalities

  Video behavior recognition and scene understanding are fundamental tasks in multimodal intelligence, serving as critical building blocks for numerous real-world applications. Through large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding, most existing open-source models rely on over 7B parameters and require large-scale datasets for training, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible to many researchers. Furthermore, lightweight models face persistent challenges in effectively processing long visual sequences and temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce TinyLLaVA-Video, a lightweight yet powerful video understanding model with approximately 3.6B parameters. The cornerstone of our design is the video-level group resampler, a novel mechanism that significantly reduces and controls the number of visual tokens at the video level. Unlike traditional image-level resampler, our approach effectively mitigates redundancy while enhancing temporal comprehension, leading to improved performance on video-based tasks. In addition, TinyLLaVA-Video demonstrates exceptional efficiency, requiring only one day of training on 8 A100-40G GPUs. It surpasses several existing 7B-parameter models on multiple benchmarks. We believe this work provides a valuable foundation for future research on lightweight video understanding models. The code and weights is available atthis https URL.

  Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in surveillance and security. Despite progress in recent years, most existing ReID models often struggle to generalize across diverse cultural contexts, particularly in Islamic regions like Iran, where modest clothing styles are prevalent. Existing datasets predominantly feature Western and East Asian fashion, limiting their applicability in these settings. To address this gap, we introduce Iran University of Science and Technology Person Re-Identification (IUST_PersonReId), a dataset designed to reflect the unique challenges of ReID in new cultural environments, emphasizing modest attire and diverse scenarios from Iran, including markets, campuses, and mosques. Experiments on IUST_PersonReId with state-of-the-art models, such as Semantic Controllable Self-supervised Learning (SOLIDER) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining Re-Identification (CLIP-ReID), reveal significant performance drops compared to benchmarks like Market1501 and Multi-Scene MultiTime (MSMT17), specifically, SOLIDER shows a drop of 50.75% and 23.01% Mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to Market1501 and MSMT17 respectively, while CLIP-ReID exhibits a drop of 38.09% and 21.74% mAP, highlighting the challenges posed by occlusion and limited distinctive features. Sequence-based evaluations show improvements by leveraging temporal context, emphasizing the dataset's potential for advancing culturally sensitive and robust ReID systems. IUST_PersonReId offers a critical resource for addressing fairness and bias in ReID research globally.

  _Jingming Liu, Yumeng Li, Boyuan Xiao, Yichang Jian, Ziang Qin, Tianjia Shao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  One of the key challenges of detecting AI-generated images is spotting images that have been created by previously unseen generative models. We argue that the limited diversity of the training data is a major obstacle to addressing this problem, and we propose a new dataset that is significantly larger and more diverse than prior work. As part of creating this dataset, we systematically download thousands of text-to-image latent diffusion models and sample images from them. We also collect images from dozens of popular open source and commercial models. The resulting dataset contains 2.7M images that have been sampled from 4803 different models. These images collectively capture a wide range of scene content, generator architectures, and image processing settings. Using this dataset, we study the generalization abilities of fake image detectors. Our experiments suggest that detection performance improves as the number of models in the training set increases, even when these models have similar architectures. We also find that detection performance improves as the diversity of the models increases, and that our trained detectors generalize better than those trained on other datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aims to discover objects in images or videos by reconstructing the input. Representative methods achieve this by reconstructing the input as its Variational Autoencoder (VAE) discrete representations, which suppress (super-)pixel noise and enhance object separability. However, these methods treat features as indivisible units, overlooking their compositional attributes, and discretize features via scalar code indexes, losing attribute-level similarities and differences. We propose Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR) for OCL. For better generalization, features are decomposed into combinatorial attributes by organized channel grouping. For better convergence, features are quantized into discrete representations via tuple code indexes. Experiments demonstrate that GDR consistently improves both mainstream and state-of-the-art OCL methods across various datasets. Visualizations further highlight GDR's superior object separability and interpretability. The source code is available onthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose UnCLe, the first standardized benchmark for Unsupervised Continual Learning of a multimodal 3D reconstruction task: Depth completion aims to infer a dense depth map from a pair of synchronized RGB image and sparse depth map. We benchmark depth completion models under the practical scenario of unsupervised learning over continuous streams of data. While unsupervised learning of depth boasts the possibility continual learning of novel data distributions over time, existing methods are typically trained on a static, or stationary, dataset. However, when adapting to novel nonstationary distributions, they ``catastrophically forget'' previously learned information. UnCLe simulates these non-stationary distributions by adapting depth completion models to sequences of datasets containing diverse scenes captured from distinct domains using different visual and range sensors. We adopt representative methods from continual learning paradigms and translate them to enable unsupervised continual learning of depth completion. We benchmark these models across indoor and outdoor environments, and investigate the degree of catastrophic forgetting through standard quantitative metrics. We find that unsupervised continual learning of depth completion is an open problem, and we invite researchers to leverage UnCLe as a development platform.

  We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks that evaluate complex visio-linguistic reasoning. However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.

  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their parameter-intensive nature and reliance on large amounts of data for effective performance have shifted the focus from traditional human-annotated labels to unsupervised learning and pretraining strategies that uncover hidden structures within the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm. SSL leverages inherent relationships within the data itself as a form of supervision, eliminating the need for manual labeling and offering a more scalable and resource-efficient alternative for model training. Given these advantages, it is imperative to explore the integration of SSL techniques with ViTs, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D human pose estimation involves reconstructing the human skeleton by detecting the body joints. Accurate and efficient solutions are required for several real-world applications including animation, human-robot interaction, surveillance, and sports. However, challenges such as occlusions, 2D pose mismatches, random camera perspectives, and limited 3D labelled data have been hampering the models' performance and limiting their deployment in real-world scenarios. The higher availability of cameras has led researchers to explore multi-view solutions to take advantage of the different perspectives to reconstruct the pose.Most existing reviews have mainly focused on monocular 3D human pose estimation, so a comprehensive survey on multi-view approaches has been missing since 2012. According to the reviewed articles, the majority of the existing methods are fully-supervised approaches based on geometric constraints, which are often limited by 2D pose mismatches. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed incorporating temporal consistency or depth information. Alternatively, working directly with 3D features has been shown to completely overcome this issue, albeit at the cost of increased computational complexity. Additionally, models with lower levels of supervision have been identified to help address challenges such as annotated data scarcity and generalisation to new setups. Therefore, no method currently addresses all challenges associated with 3D pose reconstruction, and a trade-off between complexity and performance exists. Further research is needed to develop approaches capable of quickly inferring a highly accurate 3D pose with bearable computation cost. Techniques such as active learning, low-supervision methods, temporal consistency, view selection, depth information estimation, and multi-modal approaches are strategies to consider when developing a new method for this task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Motion style transfer is a significant research direction in the field of computer vision, enabling virtual digital humans to rapidly switch between different styles of the same motion, thereby significantly enhancing the richness and realism of movements. It has been widely applied in multimedia scenarios such as films, games, and the metaverse. However, most existing methods adopt a two-stream structure, which tends to overlook the intrinsic relationship between content and style motions, leading to information loss and poor alignment. Moreover, when handling long-range motion sequences, these methods fail to effectively learn temporal dependencies, ultimately resulting in unnatural generated motions. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Motion Style Diffusion (UMSD) framework, which simultaneously extracts features from both content and style motions and facilitates sufficient information interaction. Additionally, we introduce the Motion Style Mamba (MSM) denoiser, the first approach in the field of motion style transfer to leverage Mamba's powerful sequence modelling capability. Better capturing temporal relationships generates more coherent stylized motion sequences. Third, we design a diffusion-based content consistency loss and a style consistency loss to constrain the framework, ensuring that it inherits the content motion while effectively learning the characteristics of the style motion. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving more realistic and coherent motion style transfer.

  Domain generalization (DG) is an important problem that learns a model which generalizes to unseen test domains leveraging one or more source domains, under the assumption of shared label spaces. However, most DG methods assume access to abundant source data in the target label space, a requirement that proves overly stringent for numerous real-world applications, where acquiring the same label space as the target task is prohibitively expensive. For this setting, we tackle the multimodal version of the unsupervised domain generalization (MUDG) problem, which uses a large task-agnostic unlabeled source dataset during finetuning. Our framework does not explicitly assume any relationship between the source dataset and target task. Instead, it relies only on the premise that the source dataset can be accurately and efficiently searched in a joint vision-language space. We make three contributions in the MUDG setting. Firstly, we show theoretically that cross-modal approximate nearest neighbor search suffers from low recall due to the large distance between text queries and the image centroids used for coarse quantization. Accordingly, we propose paired k-means, a simple clustering algorithm that improves nearest neighbor recall by storing centroids in query space instead of image space. Secondly, we propose an adaptive text augmentation scheme for target labels designed to improve zero-shot accuracy and diversify retrieved image data. Lastly, we present two simple but effective components to further improve downstream target accuracy. We compare against state-of-the-art name-only transfer, source-free DG and zero-shot (ZS) methods on their respective benchmarks and show consistent improvement in accuracy on 20 diverse datasets.

  Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task of predicting the answer to a question about the content of an image. Prior works directly evaluate the answering models by simply calculating the accuracy of predicted answers. However, the inner reasoning behind the predictions is disregarded in such a "black box" system, and we cannot ascertain the trustworthiness of the predictions. Even more concerning, in some cases, these models predict correct answers despite focusing on irrelevant visual regions or textual tokens. To develop an explainable and trustworthy answering system, we propose a novel model termed MRVQA (Multimodal Rationales for VQA), which provides visual and textual rationales to support its predicted answers. To measure the quality of generated rationales, a new metric vtS (visual-textual Similarity) score is introduced from both visual and textual perspectives. Considering the extra annotations distinct from standard VQA, MRVQA is trained and evaluated using samples synthesized from some existing datasets. Extensive experiments across three EVQA datasets demonstrate that MRVQA achieves new state-of-the-art results through additional rationale generation, enhancing the trustworthiness of the explainable VQA model. The code and the synthesized dataset are released underthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Masked autoencoding and generative pretraining have achieved remarkable success in computer vision and natural language processing, and more recently, they have been extended to the point cloud domain. Nevertheless, existing point cloud models suffer from the issue of information leakage due to the pre-sampling of center points, which leads to trivial proxy tasks for the models. These approaches primarily focus on local feature reconstruction, limiting their ability to capture global patterns within point clouds. In this paper, we argue that the reduced difficulty of pretext tasks hampers the model's capacity to learn expressive representations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel solution called the Differentiable Center Sampling Network (DCS-Net). It tackles the information leakage problem by incorporating both global feature reconstruction and local feature reconstruction as non-trivial proxy tasks, enabling simultaneous learning of both the global and local patterns within point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the expressive capacity of existing point cloud models and effectively addresses the issue of information leakage.

  Task vectors offer a compelling mechanism for accelerating inference in in-context learning (ICL) by distilling task-specific information into a single, reusable representation. Despite their empirical success, the underlying principles governing their emergence and functionality remain unclear. This work proposes the Linear Combination Conjecture, positing that task vectors act as single in-context demonstrations formed through linear combinations of the original ones. We provide both theoretical and empirical support for this conjecture. First, we show that task vectors naturally emerge in linear transformers trained on triplet-formatted prompts through loss landscape analysis. Next, we predict the failure of task vectors on representing high-rank mappings and confirm this on practical LLMs. Our findings are further validated through saliency analyses and parameter visualization, suggesting an enhancement of task vectors by injecting multiple ones into few-shot prompts. Together, our results advance the understanding of task vectors and shed light on the mechanisms underlying ICL in transformer-based models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

  Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights. Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction - which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack full access to the deployed model.

  _Sizhe Dang, Yangyang Guo, Yanjun Zhao, Haishan Ye, Xiaodong Zheng, Guang Dai, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks: the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order (ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3, across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed, full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on memory-efficient pre-training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time scaling offers a promising path to improve LLM reasoning by utilizing more compute at inference time; however, the true promise of this paradigm lies in extrapolation (i.e., improvement in performance on hard problems as LLMs keep "thinking" for longer, beyond the maximum token budget they were trained on). Surprisingly, we find that most existing reasoning models do not extrapolate well. We show that one way to enable extrapolation is by training the LLM to perform in-context exploration: training the LLM to effectively spend its test time budget by chaining operations (such as generation, verification, refinement, etc.), or testing multiple hypotheses before it commits to an answer. To enable in-context exploration, we identify three key ingredients as part of our recipe e3: (1) chaining skills that the base LLM has asymmetric competence in, e.g., chaining verification (easy) with generation (hard), as a way to implement in-context search; (2) leveraging "negative" gradients from incorrect traces to amplify exploration during RL, resulting in longer search traces that chains additional asymmetries; and (3) coupling task difficulty with training token budget during training via a specifically-designed curriculum to structure in-context exploration. Our recipe e3 produces the best known 1.7B model according to AIME'25 and HMMT'25 scores, and extrapolates to 2x the training token budget. Our e3-1.7B model not only attains high pass@1 scores, but also improves pass@k over the base model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid, token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training large language models with reinforcement learning (RL) against verifiable rewards significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, yet remains computationally expensive due to inefficient uniform prompt sampling. We introduce Selective Prompting with Efficient Estimation of Difficulty (SPEED), an adaptive online RL curriculum that selectively chooses training examples of intermediate difficulty to maximize learning efficiency. Theoretically, we establish that intermediate-difficulty prompts improve the gradient estimator's signal-to-noise ratio, accelerating convergence. Empirically, our efficient implementation leads to 2x to 6x faster training without degrading accuracy, requires no manual tuning, and integrates seamlessly into standard RL algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training advanced machine learning models demands massive datasets, resulting in prohibitive computational costs. To address this challenge, data pruning techniques identify and remove redundant training samples while preserving model performance. Yet, existing pruning techniques predominantly require a full initial training pass to identify removable samples, negating any efficiency benefits for single training runs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel importance score extrapolation framework that requires training on only a small subset of data. We present two initial approaches in this framework - k-nearest neighbors and graph neural networks - to accurately predict sample importance for the entire dataset using patterns learned from this minimal subset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for 2 state-of-the-art pruning methods (Dynamic Uncertainty and TDDS), 4 different datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Places-365, and ImageNet), and 3 training paradigms (supervised, unsupervised, and adversarial). Our results indicate that score extrapolation is a promising direction to scale expensive score calculation methods, such as pruning, data attribution, or other tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches, such as flow matching and Schr√∂dinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path. However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr√∂dinger Bridge Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr√∂dinger bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states, and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for training large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem solving. A prerequisite for the scalability of RLVR is a high-quality problem set with precise and verifiable answers. However, the scarcity of well-crafted human-labeled math problems and limited-verification answers in existing distillation-oriented synthetic datasets limit their effectiveness in RL. Additionally, most problem synthesis strategies indiscriminately expand the problem set without considering the model's capabilities, leading to low efficiency in generating useful questions. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Self-aware Weakness-driven problem Synthesis framework (SwS) that systematically identifies model deficiencies and leverages them for problem augmentation. Specifically, we define weaknesses as questions that the model consistently fails to learn through its iterative sampling during RL training. We then extract the core concepts from these failure cases and synthesize new problems to strengthen the model's weak areas in subsequent augmented training, enabling it to focus on and gradually overcome its weaknesses. Without relying on external knowledge distillation, our framework enables robust generalization byempowering the model to self-identify and address its weaknesses in RL, yielding average performance gains of 10.0% and 7.7% on 7B and 32B models across eight mainstream reasoning benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foundation models are an emerging research direction in tabular deep learning. Notably, TabPFNv2 recently claimed superior performance over traditional GBDT-based methods on small-scale datasets using an in-context learning paradigm, which does not adapt model parameters to target datasets. However, the optimal finetuning approach for adapting tabular foundational models, and how this adaptation reshapes their internal mechanisms, remains underexplored. While prior works studied finetuning for earlier foundational models, inconsistent findings and TabPFNv2's unique architecture necessitate fresh investigation. To address these questions, we first systematically evaluate various finetuning strategies on diverse datasets. Our findings establish full finetuning as the most practical solution for TabPFNv2 in terms of time-efficiency and effectiveness. We then investigate how finetuning alters TabPFNv2's inner mechanisms, drawing an analogy to retrieval-augmented models. We reveal that the success of finetuning stems from the fact that after gradient-based adaptation, the dot products of the query-representations of test objects and the key-representations of in-context training objects more accurately reflect their target similarity. This improved similarity allows finetuned TabPFNv2 to better approximate target dependency by appropriately weighting relevant in-context samples, improving the retrieval-based prediction logic. From the practical perspective, we managed to finetune TabPFNv2 on datasets with up to 50K objects, observing performance improvements on almost all tasks. More precisely, on academic datasets with I.I.D. splits, finetuning allows TabPFNv2 to achieve state-of-the-art results, while on datasets with gradual temporal shifts and rich feature sets, TabPFNv2 is less stable and prior methods remain better.

  The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation, remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

  Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models. Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them. Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models, offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series conditions.

  The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets. Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement, which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF applications.

  Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate long-term and efficient time series forecasting is a key requirement for a variety of practical applications, and there are complex interleaving time dynamics in time series data that require decomposition modeling. Traditional time series decomposition methods are single and rely on fixed rules, which are insufficient for mining the potential information of the series and adapting to the dynamic characteristics of complex series. On the other hand, the Transformer-based models for time series forecasting struggle to effectively model long sequences and intricate dynamic relationships due to their high computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce KARMA, with an Adaptive Time Channel Decomposition module (ATCD) to dynamically extract trend and seasonal components. It further integrates a Hybrid Frequency-Time Decomposition module (HFTD) to further decompose Series into frequency-domain and time-domain. These components are coupled with multi-scale Mamba-based KarmaBlock to efficiently process global and local information in a coordinated manner. Experiments on eight real-world datasets from diverse domains well demonstrated that KARMA significantly outperforms mainstream baseline methods in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

  We present BioLangFusion, a simple approach for integrating pre-trained DNA, mRNA, and protein language models into unified molecular representations. Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.

  Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL, including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8 \times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

  We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically tailored for the long decoding of reasoning models. Extended from SeerAttention, SeerAttention-R retains the design of learning attention sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query pooling to accommodate auto-regressive decoding. With a lightweight plug-in gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing pretrained model without modifying the original parameters. We demonstrate that SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse decoding kernel that achieves near-theoretical speedups of up to 9x over FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPU at 90% sparsity.

  Soft real-time applications are becoming increasingly complex, posing significant challenges for scheduling offloaded tasks in edge computing environments while meeting task timing constraints. Moreover, the exponential growth of the search space, presence of multiple objectives and parameters, and highly dynamic nature of edge computing environments further exacerbate the complexity of task scheduling. As a result, schedulers based on heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms frequently encounter difficulties in generating optimal or near-optimal task schedules due to their constrained ability to adapt to the dynamic conditions and complex environmental characteristics of edge computing. Accordingly, reinforcement learning algorithms have been incorporated into schedulers to address the complexity and dynamic conditions inherent in task scheduling in edge computing. However, a significant limitation of reinforcement learning algorithms is the prolonged learning time required to adapt to new environments and to address medium- and large-scale problems. This challenge arises from the extensive global action space and frequent random exploration of irrelevant actions. Therefore, this study proposes Agile Reinforcement learning (aRL), in which the RL-agent performs informed exploration and executes only relevant actions. Consequently, the predictability of the RL-agent is enhanced, leading to rapid adaptation and convergence, which positions aRL as a suitable candidate for scheduling the tasks of soft real-time applications in edge computing. The experiments demonstrate that the combination of informed exploration and action-masking methods enables aRL to achieve a higher hit-ratio and converge faster than the baseline approaches.

  As AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly versatile and capable of addressing a broad spectrum of tasks, ensuring their security has become a critical challenge. Among the most pressing threats are prompt injection attacks, which exploit the agent's resilience on natural language inputs -- an especially dangerous threat when agents are granted tool access or handle sensitive information. In this work, we propose a set of principled design patterns for building AI agents with provable resistance to prompt injection. We systematically analyze these patterns, discuss their trade-offs in terms of utility and security, and illustrate their real-world applicability through a series of case studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks are known to suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients as depth increases, a phenomenon closely tied to the spectral behavior of the input-output Jacobian. Prior work has identified critical initialization schemes that ensure Jacobian stability, but these analyses are typically restricted to fully connected networks with i.i.d. weights. In this work, we go significantly beyond these limitations: we establish a general stability theorem for deep neural networks that accommodates sparsity (such as that introduced by pruning) and non-i.i.d., weakly correlated weights (e.g. induced by training). Our results rely on recent advances in random matrix theory, and provide rigorous guarantees for spectral stability in a much broader class of network models. This extends the theoretical foundation for initialization schemes in modern neural networks with structured and dependent randomness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting, government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect, standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139 types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization, providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general, lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration, highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data. Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in smart grids.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the standard Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are more susceptible to over-optimization, in which the model drifts away from the reference policy, leading to degraded performance as training progresses. This paper proposes a novel importance-sampling approach to mitigate the over-optimization problem of offline DAAs. This approach, called (IS-DAAs), multiplies the DAA objective with an importance ratio that accounts for the reference policy distribution. IS-DAAs additionally avoid the high variance issue associated with importance sampling by clipping the importance ratio to a maximum value. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that IS-DAAs can effectively mitigate over-optimization, especially under low regularization strength, and achieve better performance than other methods designed to address this problem. Our implementations are provided publicly at this link.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

  _Jinkwan Jang, Hyungjin Park, Jinmyeong Choi, Taesup Kim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate thatJoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence, highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures. The code used in this work is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-modal embeddings, such as CLIP, BLIP and their variants, have achieved promising results in aligning representations across modalities. However, these embeddings could underperform compared to state-of-the-art single-modality embeddings on modality-specific tasks. On the other hand, single-modality embeddings excel in their domains but lack cross-modal alignment capabilities. In this work, we focus on the problem of unifying cross-modality and single-modality embeddings to achieve the performance of modality-expert embedding within individual modalities while preserving cross-modal alignment. To this end, we propose RP-KrossFuse, a method that leverages a random projection-based Kronecker product to integrate cross-modal embeddings with single-modality embeddings. RP-KrossFuse aims to fuse the sample-pairwise similarity scores of the fused embeddings and operates efficiently in a specified kernel space and supports scalable implementations via random Fourier features for shift-invariant kernels such as the Gaussian kernel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RP-KrossFuse through several numerical experiments, combining CLIP embeddings with uni-modal image and text embeddings. Our numerical results indicate that RP-KrossFuse achieves competitive modality-specific performance while retaining cross-modal alignment, bridging the gap between cross-modal and single-modality embeddings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stationary Distribution Correction Estimation (DICE) addresses the mismatch between the stationary distribution induced by a policy and the target distribution required for reliable off-policy evaluation (OPE) and policy optimization. DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained RL benchmark, DSRL.

  Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The in-context learning paradigm with LLMs has been instrumental in advancing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The selection of few-shot examples (exemplars / demonstration samples) is essential for constructing effective prompts under context-length budget constraints. In this paper, we formulate the exemplar selection task as a top-m best arms identification problem. A key challenge in this setup is the exponentially large number of arms that need to be evaluated to identify the m-best arms. We propose CASE (Challenger Arm Sampling for Exemplar selection), a novel sample-efficient selective exploration strategy that maintains a shortlist of "challenger" arms, which are current candidates for the top-m arms. In each iteration, only one of the arms from this shortlist or the current topm set is pulled, thereby reducing sample complexity and, consequently, the number of LLM evaluations. Furthermore, we model the scores of exemplar subsets (arms) using a parameterized linear scoring function, leading to stochastic linear bandits setting. CASE achieves remarkable efficiency gains of up to 7x speedup in runtime while requiring 7x fewer LLM calls (87% reduction) without sacrificing performance compared to state-of-the-art exemplar selection methods.

  We introduce a novel deep learning approach that harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of contextual forecasting in sewerage systems. By developing a diffusion-based model that processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique, tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite advances in deep learning for automatic sleep staging, clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges in fair model evaluation, generalization across diverse datasets, model bias, and variability in human annotations. We present SLEEPYLAND, an open-source sleep staging evaluation framework designed to address these barriers. It includes more than 22'0000 hours in-domain (ID) sleep recordings, and more than 84'000 hours out-of-domain (OOD) sleep recordings, spanning a broad range of ages, sleep-wake disorders, and hardware setups. We release pre-trained models based on high-performing SoA architectures and evaluate them under standardized conditions across single- and multi-channel EEG/EOG configurations. We introduce SOMNUS, an ensemble combining models across architectures and channel setups via soft voting. SOMNUS achieves robust performance across twenty-four different datasets, with macro-F1 scores between 68.7% and 87.2%, outperforming individual models in 94.9% of cases. Notably, SOMNUS surpasses previous SoA methods, even including cases where compared models were trained ID while SOMNUS treated the same data as OOD. Using a subset of the BSWR (N=6'633), we quantify model biases linked to age, gender, AHI, and PLMI, showing that while ensemble improves robustness, no model architecture consistently minimizes bias in performance and clinical markers estimation. In evaluations on OOD multi-annotated datasets (DOD-H, DOD-O), SOMNUS exceeds the best human scorer, i.e., MF1 85.2% vs 80.8% on DOD-H, and 80.2% vs 75.9% on DOD-O, better reproducing the scorer consensus than any individual expert (k = 0.89/0.85 and ACS = 0.95/0.94 for healthy/OSA cohorts). Finally, we introduce ensemble disagreement metrics - entropy and inter-model divergence based - predicting regions of scorer disagreement with ROC AUCs up to 0.828, offering a data-driven proxy for human uncertainty.

  Communication system formulation is critical for advancing 6G and future wireless technologies, yet it remains a complex, expertise-intensive task. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, existing general-purpose models often lack the specialized domain knowledge, nuanced reasoning capabilities, and access to high-quality, domain-specific training data required for adapting a general LLM into an LLM specially for communication system formulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepForm, the first reasoning LLM specially for automated communication system formulation. We propose the world-first large-scale, open-source dataset meticulously curated for this domain called Communication System Formulation Reasoning Corpus (CSFRC). Our framework employs a two-stage training strategy: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data to distill domain knowledge; second, a novel rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, C-ReMax based on ReMax, to cultivate advanced modeling capabilities and elicit sophisticated reasoning patterns like self-correction and verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming larger proprietary LLMs on diverse senerios. We will release related resources to foster further research in this area after the paper is accepted.

  The integration of machine learning (ML) into the physical sciences is reshaping computational paradigms, offering the potential to accelerate demanding simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet, persistent challenges in accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency hinder the practical deployment of ML models in scientific domains. To address these limitations and systematically benchmark progress, we organized the ML4CFD competition, centered on surrogate modeling for aerodynamic simulations over two-dimensional airfoils. The competition attracted over 240 teams, who were provided with a curated dataset generated via OpenFOAM and evaluated through a multi-criteria framework encompassing predictive accuracy, physical fidelity, computational efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization. This retrospective analysis reviews the competition outcomes, highlighting several approaches that outperformed baselines under our global evaluation score. Notably, the top entry exceeded the performance of the original OpenFOAM solver on aggregate metrics, illustrating the promise of ML-based surrogates to outperform traditional solvers under tailored criteria. Drawing from these results, we analyze the key design principles of top submissions, assess the robustness of our evaluation framework, and offer guidance for future scientific ML challenges.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its gradient-based variants (e.g., GradCAM) have become standard tools for explaining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predictions. However, these approaches typically focus on individual logits, while for neural networks using softmax, the class membership probability estimates depend \textit{only} on the \textit{differences} between logits, not on their absolute values. This disconnect leaves standard CAMs vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, such as passive fooling, where a model is trained to produce misleading CAMs without affecting decision performance. We introduce \textbf{Salience-Hoax Activation Maps (SHAMs)}, an \emph{entropy-aware form of passive fooling} that serves as a benchmark for CAM robustness under adversarial conditions. To address the passive fooling vulnerability, we then propose \textbf{DiffGradCAM}, a novel, lightweight, and contrastive approach to class activation mapping that is both non-suceptible to passive fooling, but also matches the output of standard CAM methods such as GradCAM in the non-adversarial case. Together, SHAM and DiffGradCAM establish a new framework for probing and improving the robustness of saliency-based explanations. We validate both contributions across multi-class tasks with few and many classes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to safety risks during fine-tuning, where small amounts of malicious or harmless data can compromise safeguards. In this paper, building on the concept of alignment direction -- defined by the weight difference between aligned and unaligned models -- we observe that perturbations along this direction preserve model safety. In contrast, perturbations along directions orthogonal to this alignment are strongly linked to harmful direction perturbations, rapidly degrading safety and framing the parameter space as a narrow safety basin. Based on this insight, we propose a methodology for safety fine-tuning called AsFT (Anchoring Safety in Fine-Tuning), which integrates a regularization term into the training objective. This term uses the alignment direction as an anchor to suppress updates in harmful directions, ensuring that fine-tuning is constrained within the narrow safety basin. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that AsFT outperforms Safe LoRA, reducing harmful behavior by 7.60 percent, improving model performance by 3.44 percent, and maintaining robust performance across various experimental settings.

  Second-order optimization methods for training neural networks, such as KFAC, exhibit superior convergence by utilizing curvature information of loss landscape. However, it comes at the expense of high computational burden. In this work, we analyze the two components that constitute the layer-wise Fisher information matrix (FIM) used in KFAC: the Kronecker factors related to activations and pre-activation gradients. Based on empirical observations on their eigenspectra, we propose efficient approximations for them, resulting in a computationally efficient optimization method called MAC. To the best of our knowledge, MAC is the first algorithm to apply the Kronecker factorization to the FIM of attention layers used in transformers and explicitly integrate attention scores into the preconditioning. We also study the convergence property of MAC on nonlinear neural networks and provide two conditions under which it converges to global minima. Our extensive evaluations on various network architectures and datasets show that the proposed method outperforms KFAC and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, end-to-end training time, and memory usage.

  _Zhishuai Liu, Yu Yang, Ruhan Wang, Pan Xu, Dongruo Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference (TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets. We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios.

  _Qingmao Yao, Zhichao Lei, Tianyuan Chen, Ziyue Yuan, Xuefan Chen, Jianxiang Liu, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts, leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor $Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing $Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG), empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate $Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent diagnosis of three-phase engines has the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic performance and accuracy. Traditional methods largely rely on signature analysis, which, despite being a standard practice, can benefit from the integration of advanced ML techniques. In our study, we innovate by combining ML algorithms with a novel unsupervised anomaly generation methodology that takes into account the engine physics model. We propose Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both supervised ML and unsupervised signature analysis, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and reliability along with wide industrial application. The findings highlight the potential of our approach to contribute significantly to the field of engine diagnostics, offering a robust and efficient solution for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Taxonomy Expansion, which models complex concepts and their relations, can be formulated as a set representation learning task. The generalization of set, fuzzy set, incorporates uncertainty and measures the information within a semantic concept, making it suitable for concept modeling. Existing works usually model sets as vectors or geometric objects such as boxes, which are not closed under set operations. In this work, we propose a sound and efficient formulation of set representation learning based on its volume approximation as a fuzzy set. The resulting embedding framework, Fuzzy Set Embedding (FUSE), satisfies all set operations and compactly approximates the underlying fuzzy set, hence preserving information while being efficient to learn, relying on minimum neural architecture. We empirically demonstrate the power of FUSE on the task of taxonomy expansion, where FUSE achieves remarkable improvements up to 23% compared with existing baselines. Our work marks the first attempt to understand and efficiently compute the embeddings of fuzzy sets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically, DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution. Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and out-of-distribution generalization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adaptive gradient methods are computationally efficient and converge quickly, but they often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, second-order methods enhance convergence and generalization but typically incur high computational and memory costs. In this work, we introduce NysAct, a scalable first-order gradient preconditioning method that strikes a balance between state-of-the-art first-order and second-order optimization methods. NysAct leverages an eigenvalue-shifted Nystrom method to approximate the activation covariance matrix, which is used as a preconditioning matrix, significantly reducing time and memory complexities with minimal impact on test accuracy. Our experiments show that NysAct not only achieves improved test accuracy compared to both first-order and second-order methods but also demands considerably less computational resources than existing second-order methods.

  We introduce AdaAct, a novel optimization algorithm that adjusts learning rates according to activation variance. Our method enhances the stability of neuron outputs by incorporating neuron-wise adaptivity during the training process, which subsequently leads to better generalization -- a complementary approach to conventional activation regularization methods. Experimental results demonstrate AdaAct's competitive performance across standard image classification benchmarks. We evaluate AdaAct on CIFAR and ImageNet, comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, AdaAct effectively bridges the gap between the convergence speed of Adam and the strong generalization capabilities of SGD, all while maintaining competitive execution times.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We develop an optimization framework centered around a core idea: once a (parametric) policy is specified, control authority is transferred to the policy, resulting in an autonomous dynamical system. Thus we should be able to optimize policy parameters without further reference to controls or actions, and without directly using the machinery of approximate Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. Here we derive simpler algorithms at the autonomous system level, and show that they compute the same quantities as policy gradients and Hessians, natural gradients, proximal methods. Analogs to approximate policy iteration and off-policy learning are also available. Since policy parameters and other system parameters are treated uniformly, the same algorithms apply to behavioral cloning, mechanism design, system identification, learning of state estimators. Tuning of generative AI models is not only possible, but is conceptually closer to the present framework than to Reinforcement Learning.

  Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, \name\ obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing interests and applications of graph learning in diverse domains have propelled the development of a unified model generalizing well across different graphs and tasks, known as the Graph Foundation Model (GFM). Existing research has leveraged text-attributed graphs (TAGs) to tackle the heterogeneity in node features among graphs. However, they primarily focus on homogeneous TAGs (HoTAGs), leaving heterogeneous TAGs (HeTAGs), where multiple types of nodes/edges reside, underexplored. To enhance the capabilities and applications of GFM, we introduce H$^2$GFM, a novel framework designed to generalize across both HoTAGs and HeTAGs. Our model projects diverse meta-relations among graphs under a unified textual space, and employs a context encoding to capture spatial and higher-order semantic relationships. To achieve robust node representations, we propose a novel context-adaptive graph transformer (CGT), effectively capturing information from both context neighbors and their relationships. Furthermore, we employ a mixture of CGT experts to capture the heterogeneity in structural patterns among graph types. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of HoTAGs and HeTAGs as well as learning scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While existing benchmarks probe the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse domains, they predominantly assess passive reasoning, providing models with all the information needed to reach a solution. By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with external systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little systematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills. AR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and guessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and measure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning challenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary LLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently fail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap highlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning abilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies, such as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest gains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment. Collectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology for active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time feedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent frameworks can substantially boost the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs), but they typically incur heavy computational costs and lack convergence guarantees. To overcome these challenges, we recast multi-LLM coordination as an incomplete-information game and seek a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), in which each agent optimally responds to its probabilistic beliefs about the strategies of others. We introduce Efficient Coordination via Nash Equilibrium (ECON), a hierarchical reinforcement-learning paradigm that marries distributed reasoning with centralized final output. Under ECON, each LLM independently selects responses that maximize its expected reward, conditioned on its beliefs about co-agents, without requiring costly inter-agent exchanges. We mathematically prove that ECON attains a markedly tighter regret bound than non-equilibrium multi-agent schemes. Empirically, ECON outperforms existing multi-LLM approaches by 11.2% on average across six benchmarks spanning complex reasoning and planning tasks. Further experiments demonstrate ECON's ability to flexibly incorporate additional models, confirming its scalability and paving the way toward larger, more powerful multi-LLM ensembles.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact neural networks with strong performance.

  Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.

  Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice, we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately. Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD (Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in mathematical reasoning tasks when guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, they tend to produce highly confident yet incorrect outputs, which poses significant risks in domains like education, where users may lack the expertise to assess reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a structured framework that models stepwise confidence as a temporal signal and evaluates it using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In particular, we define formal STL-based constraints to capture desirable temporal properties and compute robustness scores that serve as structured, interpretable confidence estimates. Our approach also introduces a set of uncertainty reshaping strategies to enforce smoothness, monotonicity, and causal consistency across the reasoning trajectory. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves calibration metrics and provides more reliable uncertainty estimates than conventional confidence aggregation and post-hoc calibration.

  Data augmentation is a promising tool for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization, where the key is to produce diverse, challenging variations of the source domain via costly targeted augmentations that maximize its generalization effect. Conversely, random augmentation is inexpensive but is deemed suboptimal due to its limited effect. In this paper, we revisit random augmentation and explore methods to address its shortcomings. We show that the stochastic nature of random augmentation can produce a set of colliding augmentations that distorts the learned features, similar to catastrophic forgetting. We propose a simple solution that improves the generalization effect of random augmentation by addressing forgetting, which displays strong generalization performance across various single source domain generalization (sDG) benchmarks.

  We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Operator learning enables data-driven modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning mappings between function spaces. However, scaling transformer-based operator models to high-resolution, multiscale domains remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of attention and its coupling to discretization. We introduce \textbf{Mondrian}, transformer operators that decompose a domain into non-overlapping subdomains and apply attention over sequences of subdomain-restricted functions. Leveraging principles from domain decomposition, Mondrian decouples attention from discretization. Within each subdomain, it replaces standard layers with expressive neural operators, and attention across subdomains is computed via softmax-based inner products over functions. The formulation naturally extends to hierarchical windowed and neighborhood attention, supporting both local and global interactions. Mondrian achieves strong performance on Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes PDEs, demonstrating resolution scaling without retraining. These results highlight the promise of domain-decomposed attention for scalable and general-purpose neural operators.

  This monograph explores the design and analysis of correlated noise mechanisms for differential privacy (DP), focusing on their application to private training of AI and machine learning models via the core primitive of estimation of weighted prefix sums. While typical DP mechanisms inject independent noise into each step of a stochastic gradient (SGD) learning algorithm in order to protect the privacy of the training data, a growing body of recent research demonstrates that introducing (anti-)correlations in the noise can significantly improve privacy-utility trade-offs by carefully canceling out some of the noise added on earlier steps in subsequent steps. Such correlated noise mechanisms, known variously as matrix mechanisms, factorization mechanisms, and DP-Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) when applied to learning algorithms, have also been influential in practice, with industrial deployment at a global scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, with rising concerns for data privacy, Federated Learning has gained prominence, as it enables collaborative training without the aggregation of raw data from participating clients. However, much of the current focus has been on parametric gradient-based models, while nonparametric counterparts such as decision tree are relatively understudied. Existing methods for adapting decision trees to Federated Learning generally combine a greedy tree-building algorithm with differential privacy to produce a global model for all clients. These methods are limited to classification trees and categorical data due to the constraints of differential privacy. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that utilizes Genetic Algorithm to facilitate the construction of personalized decision trees and accommodate categorical and numerical data, thus allowing for both classification and regression trees. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses decision trees trained solely on local data and a benchmark algorithm.

  Enabling large language models (LLMs) to unlearn knowledge and capabilities acquired during training has proven vital for ensuring compliance with data regulations and promoting ethical practices in generative AI. Although there are growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains unclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular formulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads to performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and retain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the hierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem (which \textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority over the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical structure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the lower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the upper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new formulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning (\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but more importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics.

  We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to classical inverse methods.

  Fairness of decision-making algorithms is an increasingly important issue. In this paper, we focus on spectral clustering with group fairness constraints, where every demographic group is represented in each cluster proportionally as in the general population. We present a new efficient method for fair spectral clustering (Fair SC) by casting the Fair SC problem within the difference of convex functions (DC) framework. To this end, we introduce a novel variable augmentation strategy and employ an alternating direction method of multipliers type of algorithm adapted to DC problems. We show that each associated subproblem can be solved efficiently, resulting in higher computational efficiency compared to prior work, which required a computationally expensive eigendecomposition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing significant speedups in computation time over prior art, especially as the problem size grows. This work thus represents a considerable step forward towards the adoption of fair clustering in real-world applications.

  Despite long-standing efforts in accelerating scientific discovery with AI, building AI co-scientists remains challenging due to limited high-quality data for training and evaluation. To tackle this data scarcity issue, we present AutoSDT, an automatic pipeline that collects high-quality coding tasks in real-world data-driven discovery workflows. AutoSDT leverages the coding capabilities and parametric knowledge of LLMs to search for diverse sources, select ecologically valid tasks, and synthesize accurate task instructions and code solutions. Using our pipeline, we construct AutoSDT-5K, a dataset of 5,404 coding tasks for data-driven discovery that covers four scientific disciplines and 756 unique Python packages. To the best of our knowledge, AutoSDT-5K is the only automatically collected and the largest open dataset for data-driven scientific discovery. Expert feedback on a subset of 256 tasks shows the effectiveness of AutoSDT: 93% of the collected tasks are ecologically valid, and 92.2% of the synthesized programs are functionally correct. Trained on AutoSDT-5K, the Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct LLM series, dubbed AutoSDT-Coder, show substantial improvement on two challenging data-driven discovery benchmarks, ScienceAgentBench and DiscoveryBench. Most notably, AutoSDT-Coder-32B reaches the same level of performance as GPT-4o on ScienceAgentBench with a success rate of 7.8%, doubling the performance of its base model. On DiscoveryBench, it lifts the hypothesis matching score to 8.1, bringing a 17.4% relative improvement and closing the gap between open-weight models and GPT-4o.

  It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner, traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements. As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from inefficiencies due to unnecessarily verbose or redundant outputs. While many works have explored reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities, most primarily focus on improving accuracy, with limited attention to reasoning efficiency. Some existing approaches introduce direct length-based rewards to encourage brevity, but this often leads to noticeable drops in accuracy. In this paper, we propose Bingo, an RL framework that advances length-based reward design to boost efficient reasoning. Bingo incorporates two key mechanisms: a significance-aware length reward, which gradually guides the model to reduce only insignificant tokens, and a dynamic length reward, which initially encourages elaborate reasoning for hard questions but decays over time to improve overall efficiency. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that Bingo improves both accuracy and efficiency. It outperforms the vanilla reward and several other length-based reward baselines in RL, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of training LLMs explicitly for efficient reasoning.

  Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.

  Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K, Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective. FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l \log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$ is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon} \right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension. Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging theory to real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available atthis https URL.

  Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of automated vehicle (AV) crash severity is critical for advancing urban mobility safety and infrastructure planning. In this work, we introduce ST-GraphNet, a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework designed to model and predict AV crash severity by using both fine-grained and region-aggregated spatial graphs. Using a balanced dataset of 2,352 real-world AV-related crash reports from Texas (2024), including geospatial coordinates, crash timestamps, SAE automation levels, and narrative descriptions, we construct two complementary graph representations: (1) a fine-grained graph with individual crash events as nodes, where edges are defined via spatio-temporal proximity; and (2) a coarse-grained graph where crashes are aggregated into Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Indexing (H3)-based spatial cells, connected through hexagonal adjacency. Each node in the graph is enriched with multimodal data, including semantic, spatial, and temporal attributes, including textual embeddings from crash narratives using a pretrained Sentence-BERT model. We evaluate various graph neural network (GNN) architectures, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Dynamic Spatio-Temporal GCN (DSTGCN), to classify crash severity and predict high-risk regions. Our proposed ST-GraphNet, which utilizes a DSTGCN backbone on the coarse-grained H3 graph, achieves a test accuracy of 97.74\%, substantially outperforming the best fine-grained model (64.7\% test accuracy). These findings highlight the effectiveness of spatial aggregation, dynamic message passing, and multi-modal feature integration in capturing the complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying AV crash severity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level transport provides essential structure information for the class-level knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning traces ("thinking" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that require interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before acting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new information from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this work, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of test-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable running rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling dimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even prompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task success on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI (Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths. Using a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data web agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI enables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively. Our results establish interaction scaling as a powerful, complementary axis to scaling per-step compute, offering new avenues for training adaptive agents.

  During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs), distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model (PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update. This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge, with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, PrunE retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization. Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions -- a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but, for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a 1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet. Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain. Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties, however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking. Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the internal representations and decision mechanisms of deep neural networks remains a critical open challenge. While existing interpretability methods often identify influential input regions, they may not elucidate how a model distinguishes between classes or what specific changes would transition an input from one category to another. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that visualizes the implicit path between classes by treating the network gradient as a form of infinitesimal motion. Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first decompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable Pyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space. Rather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we amplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation to expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the steerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically meaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most sensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision boundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically meaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural classifiers' internal representations.

  Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback (CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal learning within predetermined iteration budgets. While learning rate schedules fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks, particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations. In addition, the optimal learning rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training process inefficient. In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA) schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under different constrained training budgets. First, we bridge the gap by constructing a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts for the robustness to landscape curvature variations. From this framework, we derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter \varphi that provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between \varphi and the condition number, adding interpretation and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for different values of \varphi. We offer practical guidelines for its selection via theoretical analysis and empirical results. Extensive experimental results show that UBA consistently surpasses the commonly-used schedules across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g., ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients, natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state value functions rather than state-control value functions.

  Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold, derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i) analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii) identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We consider the problem of estimating and optimizing utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR) of a loss, say $(Y - \hat Y)^2$, in the context of a regression problem. Empirical risk minimization with a UBSR objective is challenging since UBSR is a non-linear function of the underlying distribution. We first derive a concentration bound for UBSR estimation using independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We then frame the UBSR optimization problem as minimization of a pseudo-linear function in the space of achievable distributions $\mathcal D$ of the loss $(Y- \hat Y)^2$. We construct a gradient oracle for the UBSR objective and a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the set $\mathcal D$. Using these oracles, we devise a bisection-type algorithm, and establish convergence to the UBSR-optimal solution.

  The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan} filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a coarse-grainedthis http URLthe second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to $43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and energy consumption.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and ResNet50).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space. Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space that is closer to the origin.

  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits. The codebase is atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge graph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic benchmarks. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking, and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. Moreover, commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial performance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative rankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities when n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current evaluation protocols and metrics.

  Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) focuses on identifying whether observations in streaming data deviate significantly from normal patterns. With the prevalence of connected devices, anomaly detection on time series has become paramount, as it enables real-time monitoring and early detection of irregular behaviors across various application domains. In this work, we introduce PatchTrAD, a Patch-based Transformer model for time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show that PatchTrAD is on par, in terms of detection performance, with state-of-the-art deep learning models for anomaly detection while being time efficient during inference.

  Despite considerable scientific advances in numerical simulation, efficiently solving PDEs remains a complex and often expensive problem. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN) have emerged as an efficient way to learn surrogate solvers by embedding the PDE in the loss function and minimizing its residuals using automatic differentiation at so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling refinements for PINNs. In this paper, leveraging a new quadrature method for approximating definite integrals, we introduce a provably accurate sampling method for collocation points based on the Hessian of the PDE residuals. Comparative experiments conducted on a set of 1D and 2D PDEs demonstrate the benefits of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for their strong asymptotic performance and training stability, but they struggle to scale with larger batch sizes, as additional parallel environments yield redundant data due to limited policy-induced diversity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) scale naturally and encourage exploration via randomized population-based search, but are often sample-inefficient. We propose Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that combines the scalability and diversity of EAs with the performance and stability of policy gradients. EPO maintains a population of agents conditioned on latent variables, shares actor-critic network parameters for coherence and memory efficiency, and aggregates diverse experiences into a master agent. Across tasks in dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and classic control, EPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and scalability.

  How well can one expect transfer learning to work in a new setting where the domain is shifted, the task is different, and the architecture changes? Many transfer learning metrics have been proposed to answer this question. But how accurate are their predictions in a realistic new setting? We conducted an extensive evaluation involving over 42,000 experiments comparing 23 transferability metrics across 16 different datasets to assess their ability to predict transfer performance. Our findings reveal that none of the existing metrics perform well across the board. However, we find that a simple k-nearest neighbor evaluation -- as is commonly used to evaluate feature quality for self-supervision -- not only surpasses existing metrics, but also offers better computational efficiency and ease of implementation.

  Large Language Models $($LLMs$)$ solve complex problems using training-free methods like prompt engineering and in-context learning, yet ensuring reasoning correctness remains challenging. While self-correction methods such as self-consistency and self-refinement aim to improve reliability, they often reinforce biases due to the lack of effective feedback mechanisms. Multi-Agent Debate $($MAD$)$ has emerged as an alternative, but we identify two key limitations: bias reinforcement, where debate amplifies model biases instead of correcting them, and lack of perspective diversity, as all agents share the same model and reasoning patterns, limiting true debate effectiveness. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce $\textit{MetaNIM Arena}$, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs in adversarial strategic decision-making, where dynamic interactions influence optimal decisions. To overcome MAD's limitations, we propose $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ $($$\textbf{D}$iverse $\textbf{Rea}$soning via $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$gent $\textbf{D}$ebate with Refined Prompt$)$, a novel framework that $(1)$ refines LLM's strategic prior knowledge to improve reasoning quality and $(2)$ promotes diverse viewpoints within a single model by systematically modifying prompts, reducing bias. Empirical results show that $\textbf{DReaMAD}$ significantly improves decision accuracy, reasoning diversity, and bias mitigation across multiple strategic tasks, establishing it as a more effective approach for LLM-based decision-making.

  Despite their remarkable performance, large language models lack elementary safety features, making them susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause of the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a new architectural element, ASIDE, that allows language models to clearly separate instructions and data at the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies an orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating clearly distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. As we demonstrate experimentally across a range of models, instruction-tuning LLMs with ASIDE (1) leads to highly increased instruction-data separation without a loss in model utility and (2) makes the models more robust to prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we provide insights into the mechanism underlying our method through an analysis of the model representations.

  Instance selection (IS) addresses the critical challenge of reducing dataset size while keeping informative characteristics, becoming increasingly important as datasets grow to millions of instances. Current IS methods often struggle with capturing complex relationships in high-dimensional spaces and scale with large datasets. This paper introduces a graph attention-based instance selection (GAIS) method that uses attention mechanisms to identify informative instances through their structural relationships in graph representations. We present two approaches for scalable graph construction: a distance-based mini-batch sampling technique that achieves dataset-size-independent complexity through strategic batch processing, and a hierarchical hashing approach that enables efficient similarity computation through random projections. The mini-batch approach keeps class distributions through stratified sampling, while the hierarchical hashing method captures relationships at multiple granularities through single-level, multi-level, and multi-view variants. Experiments across 39 datasets show that GAIS achieves reduction rates above 96\% while maintaining or improving model performance relative to state-of-the-art IS methods. The findings show that the distance-based mini-batch approach offers an optimal efficiency for large-scale datasets, while multi-view variants excel on complex, high-dimensional data, demonstrating that attention-based importance scoring can effectively identify instances important for maintaining decision boundaries while avoiding computationally prohibitive pairwise comparisons.

  Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann generators tackle this problem by pairing normalizing flows with importance sampling to obtain uncorrelated samples under the target distribution. In this paper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework with two key contributions, denoting our framework Sequential Boltzmann Generators (SBG). The first is a highly efficient Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly on all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to the equivariant continuous flows of prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures which are highly efficient during both sample generation and likelihood evaluation. This efficiency unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies beyond standard importance sampling. In particular, we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using a continuous-time variant of sequential Monte Carlo, in which flow samples are transported towards the target distribution with annealed Langevin dynamics. SBG achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. all metrics on peptide systems, demonstrating the first equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri-, tetra- and hexa-peptides that were thus far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.

  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

  Training-free guidance enables controlled generation in diffusion and flow models, but most methods rely on gradients and assume differentiable objectives. This work focuses on training-free guidance addressing challenges from non-differentiable objectives and discrete data distributions. We propose TreeG: Tree Search-Based Path Steering Guidance, applicable to both continuous and discrete settings in diffusion and flow models. TreeG offers a unified framework for training-free guidance by proposing, evaluating, and selecting candidates at each step, enhanced with tree search over active paths and parallel exploration. We comprehensively investigate the design space of TreeG over the candidate proposal module and the evaluation function, instantiating TreeG into three novel algorithms. Our experiments show that TreeG consistently outperforms top guidance baselines in symbolic music generation, small molecule design, and enhancer DNA design with improvements of 29.01%, 16.6%, and 18.43%. Additionally, we identify an inference-time scaling law showing TreeG's scalability in inference-time computation.

  Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base -- a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo (pip install mikasa-robo-suite) -- a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation.

  Time series modeling and analysis have become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.

  Recent work reported that simple Bayesian optimization (BO) methods perform well for high-dimensional real-world tasks, seemingly contradicting prior work and tribal knowledge. This paper investigates why. We identify underlying challenges that arise in high-dimensional BO and explain why recent methods succeed. Our empirical analysis shows that vanishing gradients caused by Gaussian process (GP) initialization schemes play a major role in the failures of high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HDBO) and that methods that promote local search behaviors are better suited for the task. We find that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of GP length scales suffices for state-of-the-art performance. Based on this, we propose a simple variant of MLE called MSR that leverages these findings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a comprehensive set of real-world applications. We present targeted experiments to illustrate and confirm our findings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The scaling of model and data sizes has reshaped the AI landscape, establishing finetuning pretrained models as the standard paradigm for solving downstream tasks. However, dominant finetuning methods typically rely on weight adaptation, often lack interpretability, and depend on heuristically chosen hyperparameters. In this paper, we take a different perspective and shift the focus from weights to activation functions, viewing them through the lens of spline operators. We propose Curvature Tuning (CT), an interpretable and principled steering method that modulates a model's decision boundary by injecting a single hyperparameter into its activation functions. We show that CT provably adjusts model decision boundary curvature and, more fundamentally, projects a model onto a space of smooth functions-thereby complementing current finetuning methods, whose effect lies primarily in feature adaptation. Making this hyperparameter trainable gives rise to a novel and highly parameter-efficient finetuning method. Empirically, CT improves both generalization and robustness. For example, it boosts downstream accuracy of ResNet-50/152 by 7.14%/8.46% over linear probing and 4.64%/1.70% over LoRA across 12 datasets, and improves robust accuracy on the $\ell_\infty$ benchmark from RobustBench by 1032.64%/1494.46%.

  Recent advances in deep learning rely heavily on massive datasets, leading to substantial storage and training costs. Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this demand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require training a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being able to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more expensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage by considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a catastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a ratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various datasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise and image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Specifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to 66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test accuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to just 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.

  _Yulun Wu, Doron L. Bergman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to perform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without pre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior deep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework matches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without filtering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of missing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On common benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show that adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN. In addition, we demonstrate that our mixture block neural design has improved generalizability and greatly accelerated pre-training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges-primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). \emph{DIME} leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.

  _Jialin Zhao, Yingtao Zhang, Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning struggles to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving 24.2% additional memory savings and 24.6% faster inference over low-rank layers at rank = 50% of dimension. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods, and achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

  Performative prediction is a framework accounting for the shift in the data distribution induced by the prediction of a model deployed in the real world. Ensuring rapid convergence to a stable solution where the data distribution remains the same after the model deployment is crucial, especially in evolving environments. This paper extends the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) framework by utilizing historical datasets from previous retraining snapshots, yielding a class of algorithms that we call Affine Risk Minimizers and enabling convergence to a performatively stable point for a broader class of problems. We introduce a new upper bound for methods that use only the final iteration of the dataset and prove for the first time the tightness of both this new bound and the previous existing bounds within the same regime. We also prove that utilizing historical datasets can surpass the lower bound for last iterate RRM, and empirically observe faster convergence to the stable point on various performative prediction benchmarks. We offer at the same time the first lower bound analysis for RRM within the class of Affine Risk Minimizers, quantifying the potential improvements in convergence speed that could be achieved with other variants in our framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose a simple, training-free mechanism which explains the generalization behaviour of diffusion models. By comparing pre-trained diffusion models to their theoretically optimal empirical counterparts, we identify a shared local inductive bias across a variety of network architectures. From this observation, we hypothesize that network denoisers generalize through localized denoising operations, as these operations approximate the training objective well over much of the training distribution. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce novel denoising algorithms which aggregate local empirical denoisers to replicate network behaviour. Comparing these algorithms to network denoisers across forward and reverse diffusion processes, our approach exhibits consistent visual similarity to neural network outputs, with lower mean squared error than previously proposed methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code, and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2%-7% in certain cases.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-√†-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced atthis http URL, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.

  Despite advances in deep probabilistic models, learning discrete latent representations remains challenging. This work introduces a novel method to improve inference in discrete Variational Autoencoders by reframing the inference problem through a generative perspective. We conceptualize the model as a communication system, and propose to leverage Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) to introduce redundancy in latent representations, allowing the variational posterior to produce more accurate estimates and reduce the variational gap. We present a proof-of-concept using a Discrete Variational Autoencoder with binary latent variables and low-complexity repetition codes, extending it to a hierarchical structure for disentangling global and local data features. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty calibration, outperforming the uncoded models even when trained with tighter bounds such as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder objective. We also outline the properties that ECCs should possess to be effectively utilized for improved discrete variational inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Temporal point processes (TPPs) are widely used to model the timing and occurrence of events in domains such as social networks, transportation systems, and e-commerce. In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TPPs to capture both the semantic and temporal aspects of event sequences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a powerful language for task specification in reinforcement learning, as it allows describing objectives beyond the expressivity of conventional discounted return formulations. Nonetheless, recent works have shown that LTL formulas can be translated into a variable rewarding and discounting scheme, whose optimization produces a policy maximizing a lower bound on the probability of formula satisfaction. However, the synthesized reward signal remains fundamentally sparse, making exploration challenging. We aim to overcome this limitation, which can prevent current algorithms from scaling beyond low-dimensional, short-horizon problems. We show how better exploration can be achieved by further leveraging the LTL specification and casting its corresponding Limit Deterministic B√ºchi Automaton (LDBA) as a Markov reward process, thus enabling a form of high-level value estimation. By taking a Bayesian perspective over LDBA dynamics and proposing a suitable prior distribution, we show that the values estimated through this procedure can be treated as a shaping potential and mapped to informative intrinsic rewards. Empirically, we demonstrate applications of our method from tabular settings to high-dimensional continuous systems, which have so far represented a significant challenge for LTL-based reinforcement learning algorithms.

  The growing demands on GPU memory posed by the increasing number of neural network parameters call for training approaches that are more memory-efficient. Previous memory reduction training techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ReLoRA, face challenges, with LoRA being constrained by its low-rank structure, particularly during intensive tasks like pre-training, and ReLoRA suffering from saddle point issues. In this paper, we propose Sparse Spectral Training (SST) to optimize memory usage for pre-training. SST updates all singular values and selectively updates singular vectors through a multinomial sampling method weighted by the magnitude of the singular values. Furthermore, SST employs singular value decomposition to initialize and periodically reinitialize low-rank parameters, reducing distortion relative to full-rank training compared to other low-rank methods. Through comprehensive testing on both Euclidean and hyperbolic neural networks across various tasks, SST demonstrates its ability to outperform existing memory reduction training methods and is comparable to full-rank training in various cases. On LLaMA-1.3B, with only 18.7\% of the parameters trainable compared to full-rank training (using a rank equivalent to 6\% of the embedding dimension), SST reduces the perplexity gap between other low-rank methods and full-rank training by 97.4\%. This result highlights SST as an effective parameter-efficient technique for model pre-training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In multi-agent systems (MAS), the dynamic interaction among multiple decision-makers is driven by their innate values, affecting the environment's state, and can cause specific behavioral patterns to emerge. On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance.

  Robotic systems that rely primarily on self-supervised learning have the potential to decrease the amount of human annotation and engineering effort required to learn control strategies. In the same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self-supervised techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified rewards or labels. Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has demonstrated how self-supervised RL methods can be practically deployed on robotic systems. By first studying a challenging simulated version of this task, we discover design decisions about architectures and hyperparameters that increase the success rate by $2 \times$. These findings lay the groundwork for our main result: we demonstrate that a self-supervised RL algorithm based on contrastive learning can solve real-world, image-based robotic manipulation tasks, with tasks being specified by a single goal image provided after training.

  Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humanoid teleoperation plays a vital role in demonstrating and collecting data for complex humanoid-scene interactions. However, current teleoperation systems face critical limitations: they decouple upper- and lower-body control to maintain stability, restricting natural coordination, and operate open-loop without real-time position feedback, leading to accumulated drift. The fundamental challenge is achieving precise, coordinated whole-body teleoperation over extended durations while maintaining accurate global positioning. Here we show that an MoE-based teleoperation system, CLONE, with closed-loop error correction enables unprecedented whole-body teleoperation fidelity, maintaining minimal positional drift over long-range trajectories using only head and hand tracking from an MR headset. Unlike previous methods that either sacrifice coordination for stability or suffer from unbounded drift, CLONE learns diverse motion skills while preventing tracking error accumulation through real-time feedback, enabling complex coordinated movements such as ``picking up objects from the ground.'' These results establish a new milestone for whole-body humanoid teleoperation for long-horizon humanoid-scene interaction tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  MOMAV (Marco's Omnidirectional Micro Aerial Vehicle) is a multirotor drone that is fully actuated, meaning it can control its orientation independently of its position. MOMAV is also highly symmetrical, making its flight efficiency largely unaffected by its current orientation. These characteristics are achieved by a novel drone design where six rotor arms align with the vertices of an octahedron, and where each arm can actively rotate along its long axis. Various standout features of MOMAV are presented: The high flight efficiency compared to arm configuration of other fully-actuated drones, the design of an original rotating arm assembly featuring slip-rings used to enable continuous arm rotation, and a novel control allocation algorithm based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) used to calculate throttle and arm-angle setpoints in flight. Flight tests have shown that MOMAV is able to achieve remarkably low mean position/orientation errors of 6.6mm, 2.1¬∞ ({\sigma}: 3.0mm, 1.0¬∞) when sweeping position setpoints, and 11.8mm, 3.3¬∞ ({\sigma}: 8.6mm, 2.0¬∞) when sweeping orientation setpoints.

  This work presents a fast anytime algorithm for computing globally optimal independent contact regions (ICRs). ICRs are regions such that one contact within each region enables a valid grasp. Locations of ICRs can provide guidance for grasp and manipulation planning, learning, and policy transfer. However, ICRs for modern applications have been little explored, in part due to the expense of computing them, as they have a search space exponential in the number of contacts. We present a divide and conquer algorithm based on incremental n-dimensional Delaunay triangulation that produces results with bounded suboptimality in times sufficient for real-time planning. This paper presents the base algorithm for grasps where contacts lie within a plane. Our experiments show substantial benefits over competing grasp quality metrics and speedups of 100X and more for competing approaches to computing ICRs. We explore robustness of a policy guided by ICRs and outline a path to general 3D implementation. Code will be released on publication to facilitate further development and applications.

  Safe and efficient navigation in crowded environments remains a critical challenge for robots that provide a variety of service tasks such as food delivery or autonomous wheelchair mobility. Classical robot crowd navigation methods decouple human motion prediction from robot motion planning, which neglects the closed-loop interactions between humans and robots. This lack of a model for human reactions to the robot plan (e.g. moving out of the way) can cause the robot to get stuck. Our proposed Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation (SICNav) method is a bilevel Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that combines prediction and planning into one optimization problem, explicitly modeling interactions among agents. In this paper, we present a systems overview of the crowd navigation platform we use to deploy SICNav in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. We provide a preliminary analysis of the system's operation over the course of nearly 7 km of autonomous navigation over two hours in both indoor and outdoor environments.

  Humanoid robots have demonstrated robust locomotion capabilities using Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches. Further, to obtain human-like behaviors, existing methods integrate human motion-tracking or motion prior in the RL framework. However, these methods are limited in flat terrains with proprioception only, restricting their abilities to traverse challenging terrains with human-like gaits. In this work, we propose a novel framework using a mixture of latent residual experts with multi-discriminators to train an RL policy, which is capable of traversing complex terrains in controllable lifelike gaits with exteroception. Our two-stage training pipeline first teaches the policy to traverse complex terrains using a depth camera, and then enables gait-commanded switching between human-like gait patterns. We also design gait rewards to adjust human-like behaviors like robot base height. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our framework exhibits exceptional performance in traversing complex terrains, and achieves seamless transitions between multiple human-like gait patterns.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue, existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency 93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

  Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped, just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and unseen objects with a variation of weights.

  Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development.

  While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in reasoning and planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena, particularly within structured 3D environments, remains severely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks. PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400 assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness. We benchmark 21 state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting their strengths and limitations in physically grounded, multi-step planning. Our empirical findings indicate that the performance of VLMs exhibits pronounced limitations in high-level planning and reasoning capabilities, leading to a notable decline in performance for the growing complexity of the tasks. Error analysis reveals persistent difficulties in spatial orientation and dependency reasoning. Surprisingly, chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal improvements, suggesting spatial tasks heavily rely on intuitive model comprehension. We position PhyBlock as a unified testbed to advance embodied reasoning, bridging vision-language understanding and real-world physical problem-solving.

  As robotic systems grow increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and safety-critical, the need for structured development methodologies becomes paramount. Although frameworks like the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) offer foundational tools, they often lack integration when used together. This paper addresses that gap by aligning the widely recognized V-model development paradigm with the MeROS metamodel SysML-based modeling language tailored for ROS-based systems.We propose a domain-specific methodology that bridges ROS-centric modelling with systems engineering practices. Our approach formalises the structure, behaviour, and validation processes of robotic systems using MeROS, while extending it with a generalized, adaptable V-model compatible with both ROS and ROS 2. Rather than prescribing a fixed procedure, the approach supports project-specific flexibility and reuse, offering guidance across all stages of development.The approach is validated through a comprehensive case study on HeROS, a heterogeneous multi-robot platform comprising manipulators, mobile units, and dynamic test environments. This example illustrates how the MeROS-compatible V-model enhances traceability and system consistency while remaining accessible and extensible for future adaptation. The work contributes a structured, tool-agnostic foundation for developers and researchers seeking to apply MBSE practices in ROS-based projects.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ESVC(Ellipse-based Segmental Varying Curvature) foot, a robot foot design inspired by the rollover shape of the human foot, significantly enhances the energy efficiency of the robot walking gait. However, due to the tilt of the supporting leg, the error of the contact model are amplified, making robot state estimation more challenging. Therefore, this paper focuses on the noise analysis and state estimation for robot walking with the ESVC foot. First, through physical robot experiments, we investigate the effect of the ESVC foot on robot measurement noise and process noise. and a noise-time regression model using sliding window strategy is developed. Then, a hierarchical adaptive state estimator for biped robots with the ESVC foot is proposed. The state estimator consists of two stages: pre-estimation and post-estimation. In the pre-estimation stage, a data fusion-based estimation is employed to process the sensory data. During post-estimation, the acceleration of center of mass is first estimated, and then the noise covariance matrices are adjusted based on the regression model. Following that, an EKF(Extended Kalman Filter) based approach is applied to estimate the centroid state during robot walking. Physical experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive state estimator for biped robot walking with the ESVC foot not only provides higher precision than both EKF and Adaptive EKF, but also converges faster under varying noise conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Safety validation of autonomous driving systems is extremely challenging due to the high risks and costs of real-world testing as well as the rarity and diversity of potential failures. To address these challenges, we train a denoising diffusion model to generate potential failure cases of an autonomous vehicle given any initial traffic state. Experiments on a four-way intersection problem show that in a variety of scenarios, the diffusion model can generate realistic failure samples while capturing a wide variety of potential failures. Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training and inference with modest computing resources, and does not assume any prior knowledge of the system under test, with applicability to safety validation for traffic intersections.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this work, we propose an attention-based deep reinforcement learning approach to address the adaptive informative path planning (IPP) problem in 3D space, where an aerial robot equipped with a downward-facing sensor must dynamically adjust its 3D position to balance sensing footprint and accuracy, and finally obtain a high-quality belief of an underlying field of interest over a given domain (e.g., presence of specific plants, hazardous gas, geological structures, etc.). In adaptive IPP tasks, the agent is tasked with maximizing information collected under time/distance constraints, continuously adapting its path based on newly acquired sensor data. To this end, we leverage attention mechanisms for their strong ability to capture global spatial dependencies across large action spaces, allowing the agent to learn an implicit estimation of environmental transitions. Our model builds a contextual belief representation over the entire domain, guiding sequential movement decisions that optimize both short- and long-term search objectives. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art planners demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces environmental uncertainty within constrained budgets, thus allowing the agent to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. We further show our model generalizes well to environments of varying sizes, highlighting its potential for many real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a periodic bipedal gait learning method using reward composition, integrated with a real-time gait planner for humanoid robots. First, we introduce a novel gait planner that incorporates dynamics to design the desired joint trajectory. In the gait design process, the 3D robot model is decoupled into two 2D models, which are then approximated as hybrid inverted pendulums (H-LIP) for trajectory planning. The gait planner operates in parallel in real time within the robot's learning environment. Second, based on this gait planner, we design three effective reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework, forming a reward composition to achieve periodic bipedal gait. This reward composition reduces the robot's learning time and enhances locomotion performance. Finally, a gait design example and performance comparison are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have revolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret vision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning. However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Advanced dexterous manipulation involving multiple simultaneous contacts across different surfaces, like pinching coins from ground or manipulating intertwined objects, remains challenging for robotic systems. Such tasks exceed the capabilities of vision and proprioception alone, requiring high-resolution tactile sensing with calibrated physical metrics. Raw optical tactile sensor images, while information-rich, lack interpretability and cross-sensor transferability, limiting their real-world utility. TensorTouch addresses this challenge by integrating finite element analysis with deep learning to extract comprehensive contact information from optical tactile sensors, including stress tensors, deformation fields, and force distributions at pixel-level resolution. The TensorTouch framework achieves sub-millimeter position accuracy and precise force estimation while supporting large sensor deformations crucial for manipulating soft objects. Experimental validation demonstrates 90% success in selectively grasping one of two strings based on detected motion, enabling new contact-rich manipulation capabilities previously inaccessible to robotic systems.

  We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity} issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed, which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop {\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap. Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of using \textit{CALL}.

  Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping, assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning has shown great promise in robotic manipulation, but the policy's execution is often unsatisfactorily slow due to commonly tardy demonstrations collected by human operators. In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose CARE (Collision Avoidance via Repulsive Estimation), a plug-and-play module that enhances the safety of vision-based navigation without requiring additional range sensors or fine-tuning of pretrained models. While recent foundation models using only RGB inputs have shown strong performance, they often fail to generalize in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments with unseen objects or variations in camera parameters (e.g., field of view, pose, or focal length). Without fine-tuning, these models may generate unsafe trajectories that lead to collisions, requiring costly data collection and retraining. CARE addresses this limitation by seamlessly integrating with any RGB-based navigation system that outputs local trajectories, dynamically adjusting them using repulsive force vectors derived from monocular depth maps. We evaluate CARE by combining it with state-of-the-art vision-based navigation models across multiple robot platforms. CARE consistently reduces collision rates (up to 100%) without sacrificing goal-reaching performance and improves collision-free travel distance by up to 10.7x in exploration tasks.

  _Quanyi Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents an adaptive path planner for object search in agricultural fields using UAVs. The path planner uses a high-altitude coverage flight path and plans additional low-altitude inspections when the detection network is uncertain. The path planner was evaluated in an offline simulation environment containing real-world images. We trained a YOLOv8 detection network to detect artificial plants placed in grass fields to showcase the potential of our path planner. We evaluated the effect of different detection certainty measures, optimized the path planning parameters, investigated the effects of localization errors, and different numbers of objects in the field. The YOLOv8 detection confidence worked best to differentiate between true and false positive detections and was therefore used in the adaptive planner. The optimal parameters of the path planner depended on the distribution of objects in the field. When the objects were uniformly distributed, more low-altitude inspections were needed compared to a non-uniform distribution of objects, resulting in a longer path length. The adaptive planner proved to be robust against localization uncertainty. When increasing the number of objects, the flight path length increased, especially when the objects were uniformly distributed. When the objects were non-uniformly distributed, the adaptive path planner yielded a shorter path than a low-altitude coverage path, even with a high number of objects. Overall, the presented adaptive path planner allowed finding non-uniformly distributed objects in a field faster than a coverage path planner and resulted in a compatible detection accuracy.

  Tracking and mapping in large-scale, unbounded outdoor environments using only monocular RGB input presents substantial challenges for existing SLAM systems. Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM methods are typically limited to small, bounded indoor settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GigaSLAM, the first RGB NeRF / 3DGS-based SLAM framework for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, as demonstrated on the KITTI, KITTI 360, 4 Seasons and A2D2 datasets. Our approach employs a hierarchical sparse voxel map representation, where Gaussians are decoded by neural networks at multiple levels of detail. This design enables efficient, scalable mapping and high-fidelity viewpoint rendering across expansive, unbounded scenes. For front-end tracking, GigaSLAM utilizes a metric depth model combined with epipolar geometry and PnP algorithms to accurately estimate poses, while incorporating a Bag-of-Words-based loop closure mechanism to maintain robust alignment over long trajectories. Consequently, GigaSLAM delivers high-precision tracking and visually faithful rendering on urban outdoor benchmarks, establishing a robust SLAM solution for large-scale, long-term scenarios, and significantly extending the applicability of Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems to unbounded outdoor environments.

  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have significantly impacted robotics, enabling high-level semantic motion planning applications. Reinforcement Learning (RL), a complementary paradigm, enables agents to autonomously optimize complex behaviors through interaction and reward signals. However, designing effective reward functions for RL remains challenging, especially in real-world tasks where sparse rewards are insufficient and dense rewards require elaborate design. In this work, we propose Autonomous Reinforcement learning for Complex Human-Informed Environments (ARCHIE), an unsupervised pipeline leveraging GPT-4, a pre-trained LLM, to generate reward functions directly from natural language task descriptions. The rewards are used to train RL agents in simulated environments, where we formalize the reward generation process to enhance feasibility. Additionally, GPT-4 automates the coding of task success criteria, creating a fully automated, one-shot procedure for translating human-readable text into deployable robot skills. Our approach is validated through extensive simulated experiments on single-arm and bi-manual manipulation tasks using an ABB YuMi collaborative robot, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness. Tasks are demonstrated on the real robot setup.

  In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.

  Accurate time synchronization between heterogeneous sensors is crucial for ensuring robust state estimation in multi-sensor fusion systems. Sensor delays often cause discrepancies between the actual time when the event was captured and the time of sensor measurement, leading to temporal misalignment (time offset) between sensor measurement streams. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based radar-inertial odometry (RIO) framework that estimates the time offset online. The radar ego-velocity measurement model, derived from a single radar scan, is formulated to incorporate the time offset into the update. By leveraging temporal calibration, the proposed RIO enables accurate propagation and measurement updates based on a common time stream. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accurate time offset estimation of the proposed method and its impact on RIO performance, validating the importance of sensor time synchronization. Our implementation of the EKF-RIO with online temporal calibration is available atthis https URL.

  Our aim is to learn to solve long-horizon decision-making problems in complex robotics domains given low-level skills and a handful of short-horizon demonstrations containing sequences of images. To this end, we focus on learning abstract symbolic world models that facilitate zero-shot generalization to novel goals via planning. A critical component of such models is the set of symbolic predicates that define properties of and relationships between objects. In this work, we leverage pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to propose a large set of visual predicates potentially relevant for decision-making, and to evaluate those predicates directly from camera images. At training time, we pass the proposed predicates and demonstrations into an optimization-based model-learning algorithm to obtain an abstract symbolic world model that is defined in terms of a compact subset of the proposed predicates. At test time, given a novel goal in a novel setting, we use the VLM to construct a symbolic description of the current world state, and then use a search-based planning algorithm to find a sequence of low-level skills that achieves the goal. We demonstrate empirically across experiments in both simulation and the real world that our method can generalize aggressively, applying its learned world model to solve problems with a wide variety of object types, arrangements, numbers of objects, and visual backgrounds, as well as novel goals and much longer horizons than those seen at training time.

  To safely and efficiently solve motion planning problems in multi-agent settings, most approaches attempt to solve a joint optimization that explicitly accounts for the responses triggered in other agents. This often results in solutions with an exponential computational complexity, making these methods intractable for complex scenarios with many agents. While sequential predict-and-plan approaches are more scalable, they tend to perform poorly in highly interactive environments. This paper proposes a method to improve the interactive capabilities of sequential predict-and-plan methods in multi-agent navigation problems by introducing predictability as an optimization objective. We interpret predictability through the use of general prediction models, by allowing agents to predict themselves and estimate how they align with these external predictions. We formally introduce this behavior through the free-energy of the system, which reduces under appropriate bounds to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between plan and prediction, and use this as a penalty for unpredictablethis http URLproposed interpretation of predictability allows agents to more robustly leverage prediction models, and fosters a soft social convention that accelerates agreement on coordination strategies without the need of explicit high level control or communication. We show how this predictability-aware planning leads to lower-cost trajectories and reduces planning effort in a set of multi-robot problems, including autonomous driving experiments with human driver data, where we show that the benefits of considering predictability apply even when only the ego-agent uses this strategy.

  Rapid search and rescue is critical to maximizing survival rates following natural disasters. However, these efforts are challenged by the need to search large disaster zones, lack of reliability in the communications infrastructure, and a priori unknown numbers of objects of interest (OOIs), such as injured survivors. Aerial robots are increasingly being deployed for search and rescue due to their high mobility, but there remains a gap in deploying multi-robot autonomous aerial systems for methodical search of large environments. Prior works have relied on preprogrammed paths from human operators or are evaluated only in simulation. We bridge these gaps in the state of the art by developing and demonstrating a decentralized active search system, which biases its trajectories to take additional views of uncertain OOIs. The methodology leverages stochasticity for rapid coverage in communication denied scenarios. When communications are available, robots share poses, goals, and OOI information to accelerate the rate of search. Detections from multiple images and vehicles are fused to provide a mean and covariance for each OOI location. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments in Bloomingdale, OH, are conducted to validate the approach. The results demonstrate the active search approach outperforms greedy coverage-based planning in communication-denied scenarios while maintaining comparable performance in communication-enabled scenarios. The results also demonstrate the ability to detect and localize all a priori unknown OOIs with a mean error of approximately 3m at flight altitudes between 50m-60m.

  When humans create sculptures, we are able to reason about how geometrically we need to alter the clay state to reach our target goal. We are not computing point-wise similarity metrics, or reasoning about low-level positioning of our tools, but instead determining the higher-level changes that need to be made. In this work, we propose LLM-Craft, a novel pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reason about and generate deformation-based crafting action sequences. We simplify and couple the state and action representations to further encourage shape-based reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, LLM-Craft is the first system successfully leveraging LLMs for complex deformable object interactions. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that with the LLM-Craft framework, LLMs are able to successfully create a set of simple letter shapes. We explore a variety of rollout strategies, and compare performances of LLM-Craft variants with and without an explicit goal shape images.

  Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is typically restricted to short, finite horizons to limit the computational burden of online optimization. As a result, global planning frameworks are frequently necessary to avoid local minima when using NMPC for navigation in complex environments. By contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can generate policies that minimize the expected cost over an infinite-horizon and can often avoid local minima, even when operating only on current sensor measurements. However, these learned policies are usually unable to provide performance guarantees (e.g., on collision avoidance), especially when outside of the training distribution. In this paper, we augment Probably Approximately Correct NMPC (PAC-NMPC), a sampling-based stochastic NMPC algorithm capable of providing statistical guarantees of performance and safety, with an approximate perception-based value function trained via RL. We demonstrate in simulation that our algorithm can improve the long-term behavior of PAC-NMPC while outperforming other approaches with regards to safety for both planar car dynamics and more complex, high-dimensional fixed-wing aerial vehicle dynamics. We also demonstrate that, even when our value function is trained in simulation, our algorithm can successfully achieve statistically safe navigation on hardware using a 1/10th scale rally car in cluttered real-world environments using only current sensor information.
