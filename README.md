- **[Advancing Medical Artificial Intelligence Using a Century of Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12194)**  `arXiv:2509.12194`  
  _Thomas A. Buckley, Riccardo Conci, Peter G. Brodeur, Jason Gusdorf, Sourik Beltr√°n, Bita Behrouzi, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  BACKGROUND: For over a century, the New England Journal of Medicine Clinicopathological Conferences (CPCs) have tested the reasoning of expert physicians and, recently, artificial intelligence (AI). However, prior AI evaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted reasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025), we conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create CPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and multimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models (LLMs). Then, we developed "Dr. CaBot," an AI discussant designed to produce written and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation, modeling the role of the human expert in these cases.RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the final diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases, outperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached 98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per unit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image tasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image challenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text, physicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of trials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote research, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based differential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations, but image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and CaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI.

- **[Co-Alignment: Rethinking Alignment as Bidirectional Human-AI Cognitive Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12179)**  `arXiv:2509.12179`  
  _Yubo Li, Weiyi Song_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution. In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness). The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

- **[JustEva: A Toolkit to Evaluate LLM Fairness in Legal Knowledge Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12104)**  `arXiv:2509.12104`  
  _Zongyue Xue, Siyuan Zheng, Shaochun Wang, Yiran Hu, Shenran Wang, Yuxin Yao, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into legal practice raises pressing concerns about judicial fairness, particularly due to the nature of their "black-box" processes. This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive, open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks. JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65 extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4) informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments, enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods. Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools. JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.

- **[Bridging Engineering and AI Planning through Model-Based Knowledge Transformation for the Validation of Automated Production System Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12091)**  `arXiv:2509.12091`  
  _Hamied Nabizada, Lasse Beers, Alain Chahine, Felix Gehlhoff, Oliver Niggemann, Alexander Fay_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior. However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions, effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual transformations or external capability models, the method supports native integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning artifacts.The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI planning.

- **[When Safe Unimodal Inputs Collide: Optimizing Reasoning Chains for Cross-Modal Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12060)**  `arXiv:2509.12060`  
  _Wei Cai, Shujuan Liu, Jian Zhao, Ziyan Shi, Yusheng Zhao, Yuchen Yuan, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are susceptible to the implicit reasoning risk, wherein innocuous unimodal inputs synergistically assemble into risky multimodal data that produce harmful outputs. We attribute this vulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through long-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce Safe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring interpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values. Experimental results show that our SRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks, including the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly outperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs.

  _Emmanuel Adjei Domfeh, Christopher L. Dancy_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In high-stakes disaster scenarios, timely and informed decision-making is critical yet often challenged by uncertainty, dynamic environments, and limited resources. This paper presents a systematic review of Human-AI collaboration patterns that support decision-making across all disaster management phases. Drawing from 51 peer-reviewed studies, we identify four major categories: Human-AI Decision Support Systems, Task and Resource Coordination, Trust and Transparency, and Simulation and Training. Within these, we analyze sub-patterns such as cognitive-augmented intelligence, multi-agent coordination, explainable AI, and virtual training environments. Our review highlights how AI systems may enhance situational awareness, improves response efficiency, and support complex decision-making, while also surfacing critical limitations in scalability, interpretability, and system interoperability. We conclude by outlining key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need for adaptive, trustworthy, and context-aware Human-AI systems to improve disaster resilience and equitable recovery outcomes.

- **[Agentic Temporal Graph of Reasoning with Multimodal Language Models: A Potential AI Aid to Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11944)**  `arXiv:2509.11944`  
  _Susanta Mitra_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Healthcare and medicine are multimodal disciplines that deal with multimodal data for reasoning and diagnosing multiple diseases. Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.

- **[How to Evaluate Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11941)**  `arXiv:2509.11941`  
  _Ilia Kopanichuk, Petr Anokhin, Vladimir Shaposhnikov, Vladimir Makharev, Ekaterina Tsapieva, Iaroslav Bespalov, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostic workflows requires robust and consistent evaluation methods to ensure reliability, clinical relevance, and the inherent variability in expert judgments. Traditional metrics like precision and recall often fail to account for the inherent variability in expert judgments, leading to inconsistent assessments of AI performance. Inter-rater agreement statistics like Cohen's Kappa are more reliable but they lack interpretability. We introduce Relative Precision and Recall of Algorithmic Diagnostics (RPAD and RRAD) - a new evaluation metrics that compare AI outputs against multiple expert opinions rather than a single reference. By normalizing performance against inter-expert disagreement, these metrics provide a more stable and realistic measure of the quality of predicted diagnosis. In addition to the comprehensive analysis of diagnostic quality measures, our study contains a very important side result. Our evaluation methodology allows us to avoid selecting diagnoses from a limited list when evaluating a given case. Instead, both the models being tested and the examiners verifying them arrive at a free-form diagnosis. In this automated methodology for establishing the identity of free-form clinical diagnoses, a remarkable 98% accuracy becomes attainable. We evaluate our approach using 360 medical dialogues, comparing multiple large language models (LLMs) against a panel of physicians. Large-scale study shows that top-performing models, such as DeepSeek-V3, achieve consistency on par with or exceeding expert consensus. Moreover, we demonstrate that expert judgments exhibit significant variability - often greater than that between AI and humans. This finding underscores the limitations of any absolute metrics and supports the need to adopt relative metrics in medical AI.

  _Marcel van Gerven_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intel- ligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.

- **[BuildingGym: An open-source toolbox for AI-based building energy management using reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11922)**  `arXiv:2509.11922`  
  _Xilei Dai, Ruotian Chen, Songze Guan, Wen-Tai Li, Chau Yuen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for AI-based building energy management. However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL across various control problems in building energy management. To address this gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for optimization control for common problems in the building energy management field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems. With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.

- **[EgoMem: Lifelong Memory Agent for Full-duplex Omnimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11914)**  `arXiv:2509.11914`  
  _Yiqun Yao, Naitong Yu, Xiang Li, Xin Jiang, Xuezhi Fang, Wenjia Ma, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users' facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and (iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot, the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.

- **[Learning Representations in Video Game Agents with Supervised Contrastive Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11880)**  `arXiv:2509.11880`  
  _Carlos Celemin, Joseph Brennan, Pierluigi Vito Amadori, Tim Bradley_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel application of Supervised Contrastive Learning (SupCon) to Imitation Learning (IL), with a focus on learning more effective state representations for agents in video game environments. The goal is to obtain latent representations of the observations that capture better the action-relevant factors, thereby modeling better the cause-effect relationship from the observations that are mapped to the actions performed by the demonstrator, for example, the player jumps whenever an obstacle appears ahead. We propose an approach to integrate the SupCon loss with continuous output spaces, enabling SupCon to operate without constraints regarding the type of actions of the environment. Experiments on the 3D games Astro Bot and Returnal, and multiple 2D Atari games show improved representation quality, faster learning convergence, and better generalization compared to baseline models trained only with supervised action prediction loss functions.

- **[HeLoFusion: An Efficient and Scalable Encoder for Modeling Heterogeneous and Multi-Scale Interactions in Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11719)**  `arXiv:2509.11719`  
  _Bingqing Wei, Lianmin Chen, Zhongyu Xia, Yongtao Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving requires a comprehensive understanding of complex social dynamics. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the full richness of these dynamics, particularly the co-existence of multi-scale interactions and the diverse behaviors of heterogeneous agents. To address these challenges, this paper introduces HeLoFusion, an efficient and scalable encoder for modeling heterogeneous and multi-scale agent interactions. Instead of relying on global context, HeLoFusion constructs local, multi-scale graphs centered on each agent, allowing it to effectively model both direct pairwise dependencies and complex group-wise interactions (\textit{e.g.}, platooning vehicles or pedestrian crowds). Furthermore, HeLoFusion tackles the critical challenge of agent heterogeneity through an aggregation-decomposition message-passing scheme and type-specific feature networks, enabling it to learn nuanced, type-dependent interaction patterns. This locality-focused approach enables a principled representation of multi-level social context, yielding powerful and expressive agent embeddings. On the challenging Waymo Open Motion Dataset, HeLoFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting new benchmarks for key metrics including Soft mAP and minADE. Our work demonstrates that a locality-grounded architecture, which explicitly models multi-scale and heterogeneous interactions, is a highly effective strategy for advancing motion forecasting.

- **[Adapting and Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis Self-Management: A Divide and Conquer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11645)**  `arXiv:2509.11645`  
  _Zhaolong Wu, Pu Luo, Jason Pui Yin Cheung, Teng Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) self-management. We constructed a database of approximately 3,000 anteroposterior X-rays with diagnostic texts and evaluated five MLLMs through a `Divide and Conquer' framework consisting of a visual question-answering task, a domain knowledge assessment task, and a patient education counseling assessment task. Our investigation revealed limitations of MLLMs' ability in interpreting complex spinal radiographs and comprehending AIS care knowledge. To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task. Our findings indicate current MLLMs are far from capable in realizing personalized assistant in AIS care. The greatest challenge lies in their abilities to obtain accurate detections of spinal deformity locations (best accuracy: 0.55) and directions (best accuracy: 0.13).

- **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575)**  `arXiv:2509.11575`  
  _Ching Chang, Yidan Shi, Defu Cao, Wei Yang, Jeehyun Hwang, Haixin Wang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (this https URL). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful - serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions.In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to contextualize its effectiveness.

- **[Task Decoding based on Eye Movements using Synthetic Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11547)**  `arXiv:2509.11547`  
  _Shanmuka Sadhu, Arca Baran, Preeti Pandey, Ayush Kumar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning has been extensively used in various applications related to eye-tracking research. Understanding eye movement is one of the most significant subsets of eye-tracking research that reveals the scanning pattern of an individual. Researchers have thoroughly analyzed eye movement data to understand various eye-tracking applications, such as attention mechanisms, navigational behavior, task understanding, etc. The outcome of traditional machine learning algorithms used for decoding tasks based on eye movement data has received a mixed reaction to Yarbus' claim that it is possible to decode the observer's task from their eye movements. In this paper, to support the hypothesis by Yarbus, we are decoding tasks categories while generating synthetic data samples using well-known Synthetic Data Generators CTGAN and its variations such as CopulaGAN and Gretel AI Synthetic Data generators on available data from an in-person user study. Our results show that augmenting more eye movement data combined with additional synthetically generated improves classification accuracy even with traditional machine learning algorithms. We see a significant improvement in task decoding accuracy from 28.1% using Random Forest to 82% using Inception Time when five times more data is added in addition to the 320 real eye movement dataset sample. Our proposed framework outperforms all the available studies on this dataset because of the use of additional synthetic datasets. We validated our claim with various algorithms and combinations of real and synthetic data to show how decoding accuracy increases with the increase in the augmentation of generated data to real data.

- **[MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11507)**  `arXiv:2509.11507`  
  _Jared Zhu, Junde Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.

- **[Knowledge-Guided Adaptive Mixture of Experts for Precipitation Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11459)**  `arXiv:2509.11459`  
  _Chen Jiang, Kofi Osei, Sai Deepthi Yeddula, Dongji Feng, Wei-Shinn Ku_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate precipitation forecasting is indispensable in agriculture, disaster management, and sustainable strategies. However, predicting rainfall has been challenging due to the complexity of climate systems and the heterogeneous nature of multi-source observational data, including radar, satellite imagery, and surface-level measurements. The multi-source data vary in spatial and temporal resolution, and they carry domain-specific features, making it challenging for effective integration in conventional deep learning models. Previous research has explored various machine learning techniques for weather prediction; however, most struggle with the integration of data with heterogeneous modalities. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Mixture of Experts (MoE) model tailored for precipitation rate prediction. Each expert within the model specializes in a specific modality or spatio-temporal pattern. We also incorporated a dynamic router that learns to assign inputs to the most relevant experts. Our results show that this modular design enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability. In addition to the modeling framework, we introduced an interactive web-based visualization tool that enables users to intuitively explore historical weather patterns over time and space. The tool was designed to support decision-making for stakeholders in climate-sensitive sectors. We evaluated our approach using a curated multimodal climate dataset capturing real-world conditions during Hurricane Ian in 2022. The benchmark results show that the Adaptive MoE significantly outperformed all the baselines.

- **[Securing AI Agents: Implementing Role-Based Access Control for Industrial Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11431)**  `arXiv:2509.11431`  
  _Aadil Gani Ganie_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced solutions across various domains, from political science to software development. However, these models are constrained by their training data, which is static and limited to information available up to a specific date. Additionally, their generalized nature often necessitates fine-tuning -- whether for classification or instructional purposes -- to effectively perform specific downstream tasks. AI agents, leveraging LLMs as their core, mitigate some of these limitations by accessing external tools and real-time data, enabling applications such as live weather reporting and data analysis. In industrial settings, AI agents are transforming operations by enhancing decision-making, predictive maintenance, and process optimization. For example, in manufacturing, AI agents enable near-autonomous systems that boost productivity and support real-time decision-making. Despite these advancements, AI agents remain vulnerable to security threats, including prompt injection attacks, which pose significant risks to their integrity and reliability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) into AI agents, providing a robust security guardrail.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging large language models (LLMs), but existing methods often rely on a single optimization trajectory, limiting adaptability and efficiency while suffering from narrow perspectives, gradient conflicts, and high computational cost. We propose MAPGD (Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent), a framework integrating multi-agent collaboration with gradient-based optimization. MAPGD features specialized agents for task clarity, example selection, format design, and stylistic refinement; semantic gradient coordination to resolve conflicts; bandit-based candidate selection for efficient exploration-exploitation; and theoretical convergence guarantees. Experiments on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks show MAPGD outperforms single-agent and random baselines in accuracy and efficiency. Ablations confirm the benefits of gradient fusion, agent specialization, and conflict resolution, providing a unified, gradient-inspired multi-agent approach to robust and interpretable prompt optimization.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing observer-based soft sensors through dynamic causality analysis. Traditional approaches to sensor selection often rely on linearized observability indices or statistical correlations that fail to capture the temporal evolution of complex systems. We address this gap by leveraging liquid-time constant (LTC) networks, continuous-time neural architectures with input-dependent time constants, to systematically identify and prune sensor inputs with minimal causal influence on state estimation. Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training an LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact through controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible effect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate this approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical domains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the structure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added complexity. Results show that our causality-guided pruning consistently identifies minimal sensor sets that align with underlying physics while improving prediction accuracy. The framework automatically distinguishes essential physical measurements from noise and determines when derived interaction terms provide complementary versus redundant information. Beyond computational efficiency, this approach enhances interpretability by grounding sensor selection decisions in dynamic causal relationships rather than static correlations, offering significant benefits for soft sensing applications across process engineering, ecological monitoring, and agricultural domains.

  _Sudeshna Jana, Manjira Sinha, Tirthankar Dasgupta_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread use of plastics and their persistence in the environment have led to the accumulation of micro- and nano-plastics across air, water, and soil, posing serious health risks including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological disorders. We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models to extract relational metapaths, multi-hop semantic chains linking pollutant sources to health impacts, from scientific abstracts. Our system identifies and connects entities across diverse contexts to construct structured relational metapaths, which are aggregated into a Toxicity Trajectory Graph that traces pollutant propagation through exposure routes and biological systems. Moreover, to ensure consistency and reliability, we incorporate a dynamic evidence reconciliation module that resolves semantic conflicts arising from evolving or contradictory research findings. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in extracting reliable, high-utility relational knowledge from noisy scientific text and offers a scalable solution for mining complex cause-effect structures in domain-specific corpora.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automating the generation of scientific videos is a crucial yet challenging task for effective knowledge dissemination. However, existing works on document automation primarily focus on static media such as posters and slides, lacking mechanisms for personalized dynamic orchestration and multimodal content synchronization. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAgent, a novel multi-agent framework that synthesizes personalized scientific videos through a conversational interface. VideoAgent parses a source paper into a fine-grained asset library and, guided by user requirements, orchestrates a narrative flow that synthesizes both static slides and dynamic animations to explain complex concepts. To enable rigorous evaluation, we also propose SciVidEval, the first comprehensive suite for this task, which combines automated metrics for multimodal content quality and synchronization with a Video-Quiz-based human evaluation to measure knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing commercial scientific video generation services and approaches human-level quality in scientific communication.

  Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has rapidly emerged with the capability to generate different forms of content, including text, images, videos, and other modalities, which can achieve a quality similar to content created by humans. As a result, AIGC is now widely applied across various domains such as digital marketing, education, and public health, and has shown promising results by enhancing content creation efficiency and improving information delivery. However, there are few studies that explore the latest progress and emerging challenges of AIGC across different domains. To bridge this gap, this paper brings together 16 scholars from multiple disciplines to provide a cross-domain perspective on the trends and challenges of AIGC. Specifically, the contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) It first provides a broader overview of AIGC, spanning the training techniques of Generative AI, detection methods, and both the spread and use of AI-generated content across digital platforms. (2) It then introduces the societal impacts of AIGC across diverse domains, along with a review of existing methods employed in these contexts. (3) Finally, it discusses the key technical challenges and presents research propositions to guide future work. Through these contributions, this vision paper seeks to offer readers a cross-domain perspective on AIGC, providing insights into its current research trends, ongoing challenges, and future directions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Knowledge Tracing (KT) serves as a fundamental component of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), enabling these systems to monitor and understand learners' progress by modeling their knowledge state. However, many existing KT models primarily focus on fitting the sequences of learners' interactions, and often overlook the knowledge state itself. This limitation leads to reduced interpretability and insufficient instructional support from the ITS. To address this challenge, we propose AlignKT, which employs a frontend-to-backend architecture to explicitly model a stable knowledge state. In this approach, the preliminary knowledge state is aligned with an additional criterion. Specifically, we define an ideal knowledge state based on pedagogical theories as the alignment criterion, providing a foundation for interpretability. We utilize five encoders to implement this set-up, and incorporate a contrastive learning module to enhance the robustness of the alignment process. Through extensive experiments, AlignKT demonstrates superior performance, outperforming seven KT baselines on three real-world datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art results on two of these datasets and exhibits competitive performance on the third. The code of this work is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems have shown strong capabilities across various tasks. However, ex- isting multi-agent frameworks often rely on static or task- level workflows, which either over-process simple queries or underperform on complex ones, while also neglecting the efficiency-performance trade-offs across heterogeneous LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Difficulty- Aware Agentic Orchestration (DAAO), a dynamic frame- work that adapts workflow depth, operator selection, and LLM assignment based on the difficulty of each input query. DAAO comprises three interdependent modules: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for difficulty estimation, a modular opera- tor allocator, and a cost- and performance-aware LLM router. By leveraging heterogeneous LLMs and dynamically tailor- ing workflows, DAAO enables fine-grained, query-specific reasoning strategies. DAAO outperforms prior multi-agent systems in both accuracy and inference efficiency across six benchmarks. We will release our code and implementation details upon publication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising solution across various domains, particularly in medical field, to mitigate data collection challenges. However, existing studies mainly utilize LLMs to rewrite and complete existing medical records, where the limitations in data privacy, accuracy, and diversity sill exist, and additionally lack the ability to interact like real patients. To address these issues, we propose a realistic patient generation framework, Patient-Zero, which requires no real medical records. Patient-Zero first introduces a medically-aligned multi-step generation architecture, which builds comprehensive patient records through hierarchical medical knowledge injection without real medical records. Then, to optimize the virtual patient's interaction abilities with humans, Patient-Zero designs a dynamic updating mechanism to improve the consistency and conversational performance. Our framework enables the generation of contextually diverse patient records while maintaining strict medical coherence, supported by adaptive dialogue strategies and real-time clinical plausibility verification. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves good performance in accuracy, diversity, and consistency. After training with our generated virtual patients, existing models show significant improvements on the MedQA dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) shifts rapidly towards dynamic, multi-agent systems. This introduces a fundamental challenge in establishing computational trust, specifically how one agent can verify that another's output was genuinely produced by a claimed LLM, and not falsified or generated by a cheaper or inferior model. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a verification framework that achieves tractable asymmetric effort, where the cost to verify a computation is substantially lower than the cost to perform it. Our approach is built upon the principle of deterministic replicability, a property inherent to autoregressive models that strictly necessitates a computationally homogeneous environment where all agents operate on identical hardware and software stacks. Within this defined context, our framework enables multiple validators to probabilistically audit small, random segments of an LLM's output and it distributes the verification workload effectively. The simulations demonstrated that targeted verification can be over 12 times faster than full regeneration, with tunable parameters to adjust the detection probability. By establishing a tractable mechanism for auditable LLM systems, our work offers a foundational layer for responsible AI and serves as a cornerstone for future research into the more complex, heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) often generate natural language rationales -- free-form explanations that help improve performance on complex reasoning tasks and enhance interpretability for human users. However, evaluating these rationales remains challenging. While recent work has relied on binary preference judgments from humans or LLM judges, such evaluations are often opaque and coarse-grained, offering limited insight into what makes one rationale better than another. In this work, we rethink preference evaluation for LLM-generated rationales by asking: (1) What attributes define good rationales? (2) Can human preferences be explained by these attributes? (3) Can attribute-based evaluation overcome the limitations of binary comparisons? We identify a set of key rationale attributes from prior literature and assess them using automatic metrics, LLM judgments, and human annotations. We then analyze two standard human preference datasets MT Bench and Chatbot Arena using SHAP to identify which attributes best explain human preference outcomes. Finally, we re-evaluate model-generated rationales using attribute-specific ELO scores, revealing more nuanced model comparisons and insights. Our findings suggest that fine-grained attribute evaluations can better characterize rationale quality and guide future research toward more interpretable and reliable evaluation practices.

  _Ron Sun_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computational cognitive architectures are broadly scoped models of the human mind that combine different psychological functionalities (as well as often different computational methods for these different functionalities) into one unified framework. They structure them in a psychologically plausible and validated way. However, such models thus far have only limited computational capabilities, mostly limited by the computational tools and techniques that were adopted. More recently, LLMs have proved to be more capable computationally than any other tools. Thus, in order to deal with both real-world complexity and psychological realism at the same time, incorporating LLMs into cognitive architectures naturally becomes an important task. In the present article, a synergistic combination of the Clarion cognitive architecture and LLMs is discussed as a case study. The implicit-explicit dichotomy that is fundamental to Clarion is leveraged for a seamless integration of Clarion and LLMs. As a result, computational power of LLMs is combined with psychological nicety of Clarion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance across various tasks without requiring fine-tuning. However, recent studies have highlighted the risk of private data leakage through the prompt in ICL, especially when LLMs are exposed to malicious attacks. While differential privacy (DP) provides strong privacy guarantees, it often significantly reduces the utility of in-context learning (ICL). To address this challenge, we incorporate task-related public data into the ICL framework while maintaining the DP guarantee. Based on this approach, we propose a private in-context learning algorithm that effectively balances privacy protection and model utility. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the utility of private ICL with the assistance of public data. Additionally, we show that our method is robust against membership inference attacks, demonstrating empirical privacy protection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, but their potential misuse for harmful purposes remains a significant concern. To strengthen defenses against such vulnerabilities, it is essential to investigate universal jailbreak attacks that exploit intrinsic weaknesses in the architecture and learning paradigms of LLMs. In response, we propose \textbf{H}armful \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{La}undering (HaPLa), a novel and broadly applicable jailbreaking technique that requires only black-box access to target models. HaPLa incorporates two primary strategies: 1) \textit{abductive framing}, which instructs LLMs to infer plausible intermediate steps toward harmful activities, rather than directly responding to explicit harmful queries; and 2) \textit{symbolic encoding}, a lightweight and flexible approach designed to obfuscate harmful content, given that current LLMs remain sensitive primarily to explicit harmful keywords. Experimental results show that HaPLa achieves over 95% attack success rate on GPT-series models and 70% across all targets. Further analysis with diverse symbolic encoding rules also reveals a fundamental challenge: it remains difficult to safely tune LLMs without significantly diminishing their helpfulness in responding to benign queries.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs), typically formalized as reasoning with Existential First-Order predicate logic with one free variable (EFO$_1$), faces a fundamental trade-off between logical soundness and computational efficiency. This work establishes the Grounding-Skolemization dichotomy for systematically analyzing CQA methods through the lens of formal logic. While Grounding-based methods inherently suffer from combinatorial explosion, most Skolemization-based methods neglect to explicitly model Skolem functions and compromise logical consistency. To address these limitations, we propose the Logic-constrained Vector Symbolic Architecture (LVSA), a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies a differentiable Skolemization module and a neural negator, as well as a logical constraint-driven optimization protocol to harmonize geometric and logical requirements. Theoretically, LVSA guarantees universality for all EFO$_1$ queries. Empirically, it outperforms state-of-the-art Skolemization-based methods and reduces inference costs by orders of magnitude compared to Grounding-based baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While individual components of agentic architectures have been studied in isolation, there remains limited empirical understanding of how different design dimensions interact within complex multi-agent systems. This study aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive enterprise-specific benchmark evaluating 18 distinct agentic configurations across state-of-the-art large language models. We examine four critical agentic system dimensions: orchestration strategy, agent prompt implementation (ReAct versus function calling), memory architecture, and thinking tool integration. Our benchmark reveals significant model-specific architectural preferences that challenge the prevalent one-size-fits-all paradigm in agentic AI systems. It also reveals significant weaknesses in overall agentic performance on enterprise tasks with the highest scoring models achieving a maximum of only 35.3\% success on the more complex task and 70.8\% on the simpler task. We hope these findings inform the design of future agentic systems by enabling more empirically backed decisions regarding architectural components and model selection.

  AI answer engines increasingly mediate access to domain knowledge by generating responses and citing web sources. We introduce GEO-16, a 16 pillar auditing framework that converts on page quality signals into banded pillar scores and a normalized GEO score G that ranges from 0 to 1. Using 70 product intent prompts, we collected 1,702 citations across three engines (Brave Summary, Google AI Overviews, and Perplexity) and audited 1,100 unique URLs. In our corpus, the engines differed in the GEO quality of the pages they cited, and pillars related to Metadata and Freshness, Semantic HTML, and Structured Data showed the strongest associations with citation. Logistic models with domain clustered standard errors indicate that overall page quality is a strong predictor of citation, and simple operating points (for example, G at least 0.70 combined with at least 12 pillar hits) align with substantially higher citation rates in our data. We report per engine contrasts, vertical effects, threshold analysis, and diagnostics, then translate findings into a practical playbook for publishers. The study is observational and focuses on English language B2B SaaS pages; we discuss limitations, threats to validity, and reproducibility considerations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI systems increasingly evaluate other AI outputs, understanding their assessment behavior becomes crucial for preventing cascading biases. This study analyzes vision-language descriptions generated by NVIDIA's Describe Anything Model and evaluated by three GPT variants (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5) to uncover distinct "evaluation personalities" the underlying assessment strategies and biases each model demonstrates. GPT-4o-mini exhibits systematic consistency with minimal variance, GPT-4o excels at error detection, while GPT-5 shows extreme conservatism with high variability. Controlled experiments using Gemini 2.5 Pro as an independent question generator validate that these personalities are inherent model properties rather than artifacts. Cross-family analysis through semantic similarity of generated questions reveals significant divergence: GPT models cluster together with high similarity while Gemini exhibits markedly different evaluation strategies. All GPT models demonstrate a consistent 2:1 bias favoring negative assessment over positive confirmation, though this pattern appears family-specific rather than universal across AI architectures. These findings suggest that evaluation competence does not scale with general capability and that robust AI assessment requires diverse architectural perspectives.

  Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are highly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges that often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often underspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.

  The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples, limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

  Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with multiple golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight the performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong reasoning abilities of closed-source models, and the remaining room for improvement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select" cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering. Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points, demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch" reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study reinforcement learning from human feedback under misspecification. Sometimes human feedback is systematically wrong on certain types of inputs, like a broken compass that points the wrong way in specific regions. We prove that when feedback is biased on a fraction alpha of contexts with bias strength epsilon, any learning algorithm needs exponentially many samples exp(n*alpha*epsilon^2) to distinguish between two possible "true" reward functions that differ only on these problematic contexts. However, if you can identify where feedback is unreliable (a "calibration oracle"), you can focus your limited questions there and overcome the exponential barrier with just O(1/(alpha*epsilon^2)) queries. This quantifies why alignment is hard: rare edge cases with subtly biased feedback create an exponentially hard learning problem unless you know where to look.The gap between what we optimize (proxy from human feedback) and what we want (true objective) is fundamentally limited by how common the problematic contexts are (alpha), how wrong the feedback is there (epsilon), and how much the true objectives disagree there (gamma). Murphy's Law for AI alignment: the gap always wins unless you actively route around misspecification.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance [7]. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

We introduce Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method with general-purpose LLMs yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while also achieving approximately 85% on S1-Bench (System-1), surpassing the baseline by over 20%. Its reasoning traces average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head & neck (H&N) cancers involves numerous conflicting objectives, requiring iterative objective parameter adjustments to balance multiple clinical goals. We propose a learning-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans for patients with diverse treatment requirements. The inverse optimizer is a learning-to-optimize (L2O) method that predicts update steps by learning from task-specific data distributions. For the first time, long-context processing techniques developed for large language models (LLMs) are utilized to address the scalability limitations of existing L2O methods, enabling simultaneous optimization over a substantially large set of variables. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable spot monitor unit (MU) values based on the PPO-refined objectives. Moreover, a Swin UnetR dose predictor is trained with prescription- and beam-specific information to estimate the initial objective parameters. In our experiments, total 97 patients with bilateral or ipsilateral H&N cancers are collected for training and testing. Compared with the second-order gradient-based methods, our L2O optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the time-consuming inverse optimization by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively, and in conjunction with the PPO-based virtual planner, plans are generated within clinically acceptable times, i.e. 2.55 hours in average, and shows improved or comparable organs-at-risk sparing with superior target coverage compared with human-generated plans.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP), which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions. Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points," intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur. Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour) before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective. In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68 participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive, habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering (Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches on graph to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.

  Earth Observation (EO) provides critical planetary data for environmental monitoring, disaster management, climate science, and other scientific domains. Here we ask: Are AI systems ready for reliable Earth Observation? We introduce \datasetnamenospace, a benchmark of 140 yes/no questions from NASA Earth Observatory articles across 13 topics and 17 satellite sensors. Using Google Earth Engine API as a tool, LLM agents can only achieve an accuracy of 33% because the code fails to run over 58% of the time. We improve the failure rate for open models by fine-tuning synthetic data, allowing much smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve comparable accuracy to much larger ones (e.g., DeepSeek-R1). Taken together, our findings identify significant challenges to be solved before AI agents can automate earth observation, and suggest paths forward. The project page is available atthis https URL.

  Mobile agents are essential for automating tasks in complex and dynamic mobile environments. As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

  The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.

  This paper introduces RouteFinder, a comprehensive foundation model framework to tackle different Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants. Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any combination of these attributes. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 48 VRP variants show RouteFinder outperforms recent state-of-the-art learning methods. Our code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance in math and reasoning benchmarks. However, they often struggle with logic problems and puzzles that are relatively easy for humans. To further investigate this, we introduce a new benchmark, SearchBench, which contains 11 unique search problems inspired by intuitive puzzles. Each SearchBench problem type is equipped with automated pipelines to generate an arbitrary number of instances and analyze the feasibility, correctness, and optimality of LLM-generated solutions. We show that using step-by-step, language-only reasoning, even the most advanced LLMs fail to solve SearchBench; for example, OpenAI's frontier models GPT-4 and o1-preview solve only 1.4% and 18.6% of problems, respectively. The reason is that SearchBench problems require considering multiple pathways and performing backtracking, posing a significant challenge to auto-regressive models. Interestingly, performance is significantly boosted when we prompt models to generate a complete A* search algorithm - a comparatively more cognitively difficult task. This approach effectively offloads the iterative search and backtracking process from the models, which they struggle with in text. This in-context learning baseline is further enhanced via a Multi-Stage-Multi-Try (MSMT) inference method, increasing GPT-4's rate of correct solutions to over 57%.

  The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has been changing the research landscape and potentially has significant implications for Digital Humanities (DH), a field inherently intertwined with technologies. This article investigates how DH scholars adopt and critically evaluate GenAI technologies for research. Drawing on 76 responses collected from an international survey study and 15 semi-structured interviews with DH scholars, we explored the rationale for adopting GenAI tools in research, identified the specific practices of using GenAI tools, and analyzed scholars' collective perceptions regarding the benefits, risks, and challenges. The results reveal that DH research communities hold divided opinions and differing imaginations towards the role of GenAI in DH scholarship. While scholars acknowledge the benefits of GenAI in enhancing research efficiency and enabling reskilling, many remain concerned about its potential to disrupt their intellectual identities. Situated within the history of DH and viewed through the lens of Actor-Network Theory, our findings suggest that the adoption of GenAI is gradually changing the field, though this transformation remains contested, shaped by ongoing negotiations among multiple human and non-human actors. Our study is one of the first empirical analyses on this topic and has the potential to serve as a building block for future inquiries into the impact of GenAI on DH scholarship.

  Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output (IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References (IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL) methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust, human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.

  This notebook reports the XplaiNLP submission to the CheckThat! 2025 shared task on multilingual subjectivity detection. We evaluate two approaches: (1) supervised fine-tuning of transformer encoders, EuroBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and German-BERT, on monolingual and machine-translated training data; and (2) zero-shot prompting using two LLMs: o3-mini for Annotation (rule-based labelling) and gpt-4.1-mini for DoubleDown (contrastive rewriting) and Perspective (comparative reasoning). The Annotation Approach achieves 1st place in the Italian monolingual subtask with an F_1 score of 0.8104, outperforming the baseline of 0.6941. In the Romanian zero-shot setting, the fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model obtains an F_1 score of 0.7917, ranking 3rd and exceeding the baseline of 0.6461. The same model also performs reliably in the multilingual task and improves over the baseline in Greek. For German, a German-BERT model fine-tuned on translated training data from typologically related languages yields competitive performance over the baseline. In contrast, performance in the Ukrainian and Polish zero-shot settings falls slightly below the respective baselines, reflecting the challenge of generalization in low-resource cross-lingual scenarios.

  The high costs of customizing large language models (LLMs) fundamentally limit their adaptability to user-specific needs. Consequently, LLMs are increasingly offered as cloud-based services, a paradigm that introduces critical limitations: providers struggle to support personalized customization at scale, while users face privacy risks when exposing sensitive data. To address this dual challenge, we propose Customized Black-box Prompt Tuning (CBP-Tuning), a novel framework that facilitates efficient local customization while preserving bidirectional privacy. Specifically, we design a two-stage framework: (1) a prompt generator trained on the server-side to capture domain-specific and task-agnostic capabilities, and (2) user-side gradient-free optimization that tailors soft prompts for individual tasks. This approach eliminates the need for users to access model weights or upload private data, requiring only a single customized vector per task while achieving effective adaptation. Furthermore, the evaluation of CBP-Tuning in the commonsense reasoning, medical and financial domain settings demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines, showcasing its advantages in task-agnostic processing and privacy preservation.

  In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines.

  In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC) environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art, general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This pilot study presents a small-scale but carefully annotated benchmark of Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance across six systems: three non-LLM NLP tools (NLTK, spaCy, Stanza) and three general-purpose large language models (LLMs: Gemini-1.5-flash, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-3-4B). The dataset contains 119 tokens covering five entity types (PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, TIME). We evaluated each system's output against the manually annotated gold standard dataset using F1-score. The results show that LLMs generally outperform conventional tools in recognizing context-sensitive entities like person names, with Gemini achieving the highest average F1-score. However, traditional systems like Stanza demonstrate greater consistency in structured tags such as LOCATION and DATE. We also observed variability among LLMs, particularly in handling temporal expressions and multi-word organizations. Our findings highlight that while LLMs offer improved contextual understanding, traditional tools remain competitive in specific tasks, informing model selection.

  This paper introduces SENSE (Shared Embedding for N-lingual Speech and tExt), an open-source solution inspired by the SAMU-XLSR framework and conceptually similar to Meta AI's SONAR models. These approaches rely on a teacher-student framework to align a self-supervised speech encoder with the language-agnostic continuous representations of a text encoder at the utterance level. We describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance. Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such semantically aligned speech encoders.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are able to generate grammatically well-formed text, but how do they encode their syntactic knowledge internally? While prior work has focused largely on binary grammatical contrasts, in this work, we study the representation and control of two multidimensional hierarchical grammar phenomena - verb tense and aspect - and for each, identify distinct, orthogonal directions in residual space using linear discriminant analysis. Next, we demonstrate causal control over both grammatical features through concept steering across three generation tasks. Then, we use these identified features in a case study to investigate factors influencing effective steering in multi-token generation. We find that steering strength, location, and duration are crucial parameters for reducing undesirable side effects such as topic shift and degeneration. Our findings suggest that models encode tense and aspect in structurally organized, human-like ways, but effective control of such features during generation is sensitive to multiple factors and requires manual tuning or automated optimization.

  We describe Vicomtech's participation in the CLEARS challenge on text adaptation to Plain Language and Easy Read in Spanish. Our approach features automatic post-editing of different types of initial Large Language Model adaptations, where successive adaptations are generated iteratively until readability and similarity metrics indicate that no further adaptation refinement can be successfully performed. Taking the average of all official metrics, our submissions achieved first and second place in Plain language and Easy Read adaptation, respectively.

  Constructive analysis of feedback from clients often requires determining the cause of their sentiment from a substantial amount of text documents. To assist and improve the productivity of such endeavors, we leverage the task of Query-Focused Summarization (QFS). Models of this task are often impeded by the linguistic dissonance between the query and the source documents. We propose and substantiate a multi-bias framework to help bridge this gap at a domain-agnostic, generic level; we then formulate specialized approaches for the problem of sentiment explanation through sentiment-based biases and query expansion. We achieve experimental results outperforming baseline models on a real-world proprietary sentiment-aware QFS dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) increasingly interact with external tools, reward modeling for tool use has become a critical yet underexplored area. Existing reward models, trained primarily on natural language outputs, struggle to evaluate tool-based reasoning and execution. To quantify this gap, we introduce FC-RewardBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically assess reward models' performance in tool-calling scenarios. Our analysis shows that current reward models often miss key signals of effective tool use, highlighting the need for domain-specific modeling. To address this, we propose a training framework for outcome-based reward models using data synthesized from permissively licensed, open-weight LLMs. We train models ranging from 1.7B to 14B parameters and evaluate them across seven out-of-domain benchmarks. These models consistently outperform general-purpose baselines, achieving up to 25\% average improvement in downstream task performance and enabling data-efficient fine-tuning through reward-guided filtering.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful multimodal reasoning but suffer from slow autoregressive inference, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5 (7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants. Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. This paper draws a conceptual parallel between quantum uncertainty and the limits of authorship detection in natural language. We argue that there is a fundamental trade-off: the more confidently one tries to identify whether a text was written by a human or an AI, the more one risks disrupting the text's natural flow and authenticity. This mirrors the tension between precision and disturbance found in quantum systems. We explore how current detection methods--such as stylometry, watermarking, and neural classifiers--face inherent limitations. Enhancing detection accuracy often leads to changes in the AI's output, making other features less reliable. In effect, the very act of trying to detect AI authorship introduces uncertainty elsewhere in the text. Our analysis shows that when AI-generated text closely mimics human writing, perfect detection becomes not just technologically difficult but theoretically impossible. We address counterarguments and discuss the broader implications for authorship, ethics, and policy. Ultimately, we suggest that the challenge of AI-text detection is not just a matter of better tools--it reflects a deeper, unavoidable tension in the nature of language itself.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Memory extraction is crucial for maintaining coherent ultra-long dialogues in human-robot role-playing scenarios. However, existing methods often exhibit uncontrolled memory growth. To address this, we propose MOOM, the first dual-branch memory plugin that leverages literary theory by modeling plot development and character portrayal as core storytelling elements. Specifically, one branch summarizes plot conflicts across multiple time scales, while the other extracts the user's character profile. MOOM further integrates a forgetting mechanism, inspired by the ``competition-inhibition'' memory theory, to constrain memory capacity and mitigate uncontrolled growth. Furthermore, we present ZH-4O, a Chinese ultra-long dialogue dataset specifically designed for role-playing, featuring dialogues that average 600 turns and include manually annotated memory information. Experimental results demonstrate that MOOM outperforms all state-of-the-art memory extraction methods, requiring fewer large language model invocations while maintaining a controllable memory capacity.

  _Taichi Aida, Danushka Bollegala_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In Semantic Change Detection (SCD), it is a common problem to obtain embeddings that are both interpretable and high-performing. However, improving interpretability often leads to a loss in the SCD performance, and vice versa. To address this problem, we propose SCDTour, a method that orders and merges interpretable axes to alleviate the performance degradation of SCD. SCDTour considers both (a) semantic similarity between axes in the embedding space, as well as (b) the degree to which each axis contributes to semantic change. Experimental results show that SCDTour preserves performance in semantic change detection while maintaining high interpretability. Moreover, agglomerating the sorted axes produces a more refined set of word senses, which achieves comparable or improved performance against the original full-dimensional embeddings in the SCD task. These findings demonstrate that SCDTour effectively balances interpretability and SCD performance, enabling meaningful interpretation of semantic shifts through a small number of refined axes.

  Political pledges reflect candidates' policy commitments, but tracking their fulfilment requires reasoning over incremental evidence distributed across multiple, dynamically updated sources. Existing methods simplify this task into a document classification task, overlooking its dynamic, temporal and multi-document nature. To address this issue, we introduce \textsc{PledgeTracker}, a system that reformulates pledge verification into structured event timeline construction. PledgeTracker consists of three core components: (1) a multi-step evidence retrieval module; (2) a timeline construction module and; (3) a fulfilment filtering module, allowing the capture of the evolving nature of pledge fulfilment and producing interpretable and structured timelines. We evaluate PledgeTracker in collaboration with professional fact-checkers in real-world workflows, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant evidence and reducing human verification effort.

  The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare raises critical questions about their ability to interpret patient-generated narratives, which are often informal, ambiguous, and noisy. Existing benchmarks typically rely on clean, structured clinical text, offering limited insight into model performance under realistic conditions. In this work, we present a novel synthetic dataset designed to simulate patient self-descriptions characterized by varying levels of linguistic noise, fuzzy language, and layperson terminology. Our dataset comprises clinically consistent scenarios annotated with ground-truth diagnoses, spanning a spectrum of communication clarity to reflect diverse real-world reporting styles. Using this benchmark, we fine-tune and evaluate several state-of-the-art models (LLMs), including BERT-based and encoder-decoder T5 models. To support reproducibility and future research, we release the Noisy Diagnostic Benchmark (NDB), a structured dataset of noisy, synthetic patient descriptions designed to stress-test and compare the diagnostic capabilities of large language models (LLMs) under realistic linguistic conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online medical forums are a rich and underutilized source of insight into patient concerns, especially regarding medication use. Some of the many questions users pose may signal confusion, misuse, or even the early warning signs of a developing health crisis. Detecting these critical questions that may precede severe adverse events or life-threatening complications is vital for timely intervention and improving patient safety. This study introduces a novel annotated dataset of medication-related questions extracted from online forums. Each entry is manually labelled for criticality based on clinical risk factors. We benchmark the performance of six traditional machine learning classifiers using TF-IDF textual representations, alongside three state-of-the-art large language model (LLM)-based classification approaches that leverage deep contextual understanding. Our results highlight the potential of classical and modern methods to support real-time triage and alert systems in digital health spaces. The curated dataset is made publicly available to encourage further research at the intersection of patient-generated data, natural language processing, and early warning systems for critical health events.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Customer feedback in industrial forums reflect a rich but underexplored source of insight into real-world product experience. These publicly shared discussions offer an organic view of user expectations, frustrations, and success stories shaped by the specific contexts of use. Yet, harnessing this information for systematic analysis remains challenging due to the unstructured and domain-specific nature of the content. The lack of structure and specialized vocabulary makes it difficult for traditional data analysis techniques to accurately interpret, categorize, and quantify the feedback, thereby limiting its potential to inform product development and support strategies. To address these challenges, this paper presents the User eXperience Perception Insights Dataset (UXPID), a collection of 7130 artificially synthesized and anonymized user feedback branches extracted from a public industrial automation forum. Each JavaScript object notation (JSON) record contains multi-post comments related to specific hardware and software products, enriched with metadata and contextual conversation data. Leveraging a large language model (LLM), each branch is systematically analyzed and annotated for UX insights, user expectations, severity and sentiment ratings, and topic classifications. The UXPID dataset is designed to facilitate research in user requirements, user experience (UX) analysis, and AI-driven feedback processing, particularly where privacy and licensing restrictions limit access to real-world data. UXPID supports the training and evaluation of transformer-based models for tasks such as issue detection, sentiment analysis, and requirements extraction in the context of technical forums.

  Declaration of Performance (DoP) documents, mandated by EU regulation, certify the performance of construction products. While some of their content is standardized, DoPs vary widely in layout, language, schema, and format, posing challenges for automated key-value pair extraction (KVP) and question answering (QA). Existing static or LLM-only IE pipelines often hallucinate and fail to adapt to this structural diversity. Our domain-specific, stateful agentic system addresses these challenges through a planner-executor-responder architecture. The system infers user intent, detects document modality, and orchestrates tools dynamically for robust, traceable reasoning while avoiding tool misuse or execution loops. Evaluation on a curated DoP dataset demonstrates improved robustness across formats and languages, offering a scalable solution for structured data extraction in regulated workflows.

  Motion instruction is a crucial task that helps athletes refine their technique by analyzing movements and providing corrective guidance. Although recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding, generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative guidance. We propose CoachMe, a reference-based model that analyzes the differences between a learner's motion and a reference under temporal and physical aspects. This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, we illustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data. Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information. CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on boxing. Analysis further confirms that it elaborates on errors and their corresponding improvement methods in the generated instructions. You can find CoachMe here:this https URL

  As the Internet and social media evolve rapidly, distinguishing credible news from a vast amount of complex information poses a significant challenge. Due to the suddenness and instability of news events, the authenticity labels of news can potentially shift as events develop, making it crucial for fake news detection to obtain the latest event updates. Existing methods employ retrieval-augmented generation to fill knowledge gaps, but they suffer from issues such as insufficient credibility of retrieved content and interference from noisy information. We propose a dynamic knowledge update-driven model for fake news detection (DYNAMO), which leverages knowledge graphs to achieve continuous updating of new knowledge and integrates with large language models to fulfill dual functions: news authenticity detection and verification of new knowledge correctness, solving the two key problems of ensuring the authenticity of new knowledge and deeply mining news semantics. Specifically, we first construct a news-domain-specific knowledge graph. Then, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search to decompose complex news and verify them step by step. Finally, we extract and update new knowledge from verified real news texts and reasoning paths. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO achieves the best performance on two real-world datasets.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in industry but remain prone to hallucinations, limiting their reliability in critical applications. This work addresses hallucination reduction in consumer grievance chatbots built using LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, a compact model frequently used in industry. We develop HalluDetect, an LLM-based hallucination detection system that achieves an F1 score of 69% outperforming baseline detectors by 25.44%. Benchmarking five chatbot architectures, we find that out of them, AgentBot minimizes hallucinations to 0.4159 per turn while maintaining the highest token accuracy (96.13%), making it the most effective mitigation strategy. Our findings provide a scalable framework for hallucination mitigation, demonstrating that optimized inference strategies can significantly improve factual accuracy. While applied to consumer law, our approach generalizes to other high-risk domains, enhancing trust in LLM-driven assistants. We will release the code and dataset

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Entity-level sentiment classification involves identifying the sentiment polarity linked to specific entities within text. This task poses several challenges: effectively modeling the subtle and complex interactions between entities and their surrounding sentiment expressions; capturing dependencies that may span across sentences; and ensuring consistent sentiment predictions for multiple mentions of the same entity through coreference resolution. Additionally, linguistic phenomena such as negation, ambiguity, and overlapping opinions further complicate the analysis. These complexities make entity-level sentiment classification a difficult problem, especially in real-world, noisy textual data. To address these issues, we propose SpanEIT, a novel framework integrating dynamic span interaction and graph-aware memory mechanisms for enhanced entity-sentiment relational modeling. SpanEIT builds span-based representations for entities and candidate sentiment phrases, employs bidirectional attention for fine-grained interactions, and uses a graph attention network to capture syntactic and co-occurrence relations. A coreference-aware memory module ensures entity-level consistency across documents. Experiments on FSAD, BARU, and IMDB datasets show SpanEIT outperforms state-of-the-art transformer and hybrid baselines in accuracy and F1 scores. Ablation and interpretability analyses validate the effectiveness of our approach, underscoring its potential for fine-grained sentiment analysis in applications like social media monitoring and customer feedback analysis.

  With many endangered languages at risk of disappearing, efforts to preserve them now rely more than ever on using technology alongside culturally informed teaching strategies. This study examines user behaviors in TALKA, a generative AI-powered chatbot designed for Hakka language engagement, by employing a dual-layered analytical framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy of cognitive processes and dialogue act categorization. We analyzed 7,077 user utterances, each carefully annotated according to six cognitive levels and eleven dialogue act types. These included a variety of functions, such as asking for information, requesting translations, making cultural inquiries, and using language creatively. Pragmatic classifications further highlight how different types of dialogue acts--such as feedback, control commands, and social greetings--align with specific cognitive intentions. The results suggest that generative AI chatbots can support language learning in meaningful ways--especially when they are designed with an understanding of how users think and communicate. They may also help learners express themselves more confidently and connect with their cultural identity. The TALKA case provides empirical insights into how AI-mediated dialogue facilitates cognitive development in low-resource language learners, as well as pragmatic negotiation and socio-cultural affiliation. By focusing on AI-assisted language learning, this study offers new insights into how technology can support language preservation and educational practice.

  Rapid developments of large language models have revolutionized many NLP tasks for English data. Unfortunately, the models and their evaluations for low-resource languages are being overlooked, especially for languages in South Asia. Although there are more than 650 languages in South Asia, many of them either have very limited computational resources or are missing from existing language models. Thus, a concrete question to be answered is: Can we assess the current stage and challenges to inform our NLP community and facilitate model developments for South Asian languages? In this survey, we have comprehensively examined current efforts and challenges of NLP models for South Asian languages by retrieving studies since 2020, with a focus on transformer-based models, such as BERT, T5, & GPT. We present advances and gaps across 3 essential aspects: data, models, & tasks, such as available data sources, fine-tuning strategies, & domain applications. Our findings highlight substantial issues, including missing data in critical domains (e.g., health), code-mixing, and lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Our survey aims to raise awareness within the NLP community for more targeted data curation, unify benchmarks tailored to cultural and linguistic nuances of South Asia, and encourage an equitable representation of South Asian languages.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their practical application is often hindered by the generation of non-factual content, which is called "hallucination". Ensuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics. Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)}, a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1) \textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift}, which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response capabilities of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, document chunking as an important part of RAG system often lacks effective evaluation tools. This paper first analyzes why existing RAG evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for assessing document chunking quality, specifically due to evidence sparsity. Based on this conclusion, we propose HiCBench, which includes manually annotated multi-level document chunking points, synthesized evidence-dense quetion answer(QA) pairs, and their corresponding evidence sources. Additionally, we introduce the HiChunk framework, a multi-level document structuring framework based on fine-tuned LLMs, combined with the Auto-Merge retrieval algorithm to improve retrieval quality. Experiments demonstrate that HiCBench effectively evaluates the impact of different chunking methods across the entire RAG pipeline. Moreover, HiChunk achieves better chunking quality within reasonable time consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of RAG systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a major barrier to their reliable use in critical decision-making. Although existing hallucination detection methods have improved accuracy, they still struggle with disentangling semantic and reasoning information and maintaining robustness. To address these challenges, we propose HARP (Hallucination detection via reasoning subspace projection), a novel hallucination detection framework. HARP establishes that the hidden state space of LLMs can be decomposed into a direct sum of a semantic subspace and a reasoning subspace, where the former encodes linguistic expression and the latter captures internal reasoning processes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Unembedding layer can disentangle these subspaces, and by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to its parameters, the basis vectors spanning the semantic and reasoning subspaces are obtained. Finally, HARP projects hidden states onto the basis vectors of the reasoning subspace, and the resulting projections are then used as input features for hallucination detection in LLMs. By using these projections, HARP reduces the dimension of the feature to approximately 5% of the original, filters out most noise, and achieves enhanced robustness. Experiments across multiple datasets show that HARP achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance; in particular, it achieves an AUROC of 92.8% on TriviaQA, outperforming the previous best method by 7.5%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Antonymy has long received particular attention in lexical semantics. Previous studies have shown that antonym pairs frequently co-occur in text, across genres and parts of speech, more often than would be expected by chance. However, whether this co-occurrence pattern is distinctive of antonymy remains unclear, due to a lack of comparison with other semantic relations. This work fills the gap by comparing antonymy with three other relations across parts of speech using robust co-occurrence metrics. We find that antonymy is distinctive in three respects: antonym pairs co-occur with high strength, in a preferred linear order, and within short spans. All results are available online.

  BACKGROUND: Medical large language models (LLMS) have demonstrated remarkable performance in answering medical examinations. However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.

  During spontaneous conversations, speakers collaborate on novel referring expressions, which they can then re-use in subsequent conversations. Understanding such referring expressions is an important ability for an embodied agent, so that it can carry out tasks in the real world. This requires integrating and understanding language, vision, and conversational interaction. We study the capabilities of seven state-of-the-art Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) as overhearers to a corpus of spontaneous conversations between pairs of human discourse participants engaged in a collaborative object-matching task. We find that such a task remains challenging for current LVLMs and they all fail to show a consistent performance improvement as they overhear more conversations from the same discourse participants repeating the same task for multiple rounds. We release our corpus and code for reproducibility and to facilitate future research.

  _Zhongyang Hu, Naijie Gu, Xiangzhi Tao, Tianhui Gu, Yibing Zhou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A key subtask in lexical substitution is ranking the given candidate words. A common approach is to replace the target word with a candidate in the original sentence and feed the modified sentence into a model to capture semantic differences before and after substitution. However, effectively modeling the bidirectional influence of candidate substitution on both the target word and its context remains challenging. Existing methods often focus solely on semantic changes at the target position or rely on parameter tuning over multiple evaluation metrics, making it difficult to accurately characterize semantic variation. To address this, we investigate two approaches: one based on attention weights and another leveraging the more interpretable integrated gradients method, both designed to measure the influence of context tokens on the target token and to rank candidates by incorporating semantic similarity between the original and substituted sentences. Experiments on the LS07 and SWORDS datasets demonstrate that both approaches improve ranking performance.

  Claim normalization, the transformation of informal social media posts into concise, self-contained statements, is a crucial step in automated fact-checking pipelines. This paper details our submission to the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Task~2, which challenges systems to perform claim normalization across twenty languages, divided into thirteen supervised (high-resource) and seven zero-shot (no training data) tracks.Our approach, leveraging fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for supervised languages and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting for zero-shot scenarios, achieved podium positions (top three) in fifteen of the twenty languages. Notably, this included second-place rankings in eight languages, five of which were among the seven designated zero-shot languages, underscoring the effectiveness of our LLM-based zero-shot strategy. For Portuguese, our initial development language, our system achieved an average METEOR score of 0.5290, ranking third.

  This paper presents our system for Task 3 of the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab, which focuses on verifying numerical and temporal claims using retrieved evidence. We explore two complementary approaches: zero-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and supervised fine-tuning using parameter-efficient LoRA. To enhance evidence quality, we investigate several selection strategies, including full-document input and top-k sentence filtering using BM25 and MiniLM. Our best-performing model LLaMA fine-tuned with LoRA achieves strong performance on the English validation set. However, a notable drop in the test set highlights a generalization challenge. These findings underscore the importance of evidence granularity and model adaptation for robust numerical fact verification.

  Coreference Resolution (CR) is crucial for many NLP tasks, but existing LLMs struggle with hallucination and under-performance. In this paper, we investigate the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches to CR-specifically the Question-Answering (QA) Template and Document Template methods and propose two novel techniques: Reversed Training with Joint Inference and Iterative Document Generation. Our experiments show that Reversed Training improves the QA Template method, while Iterative Document Generation eliminates hallucinations in the generated source text and boosts coreference resolution. Integrating these methods and techniques offers an effective and robust solution to LLM-based coreference resolution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce CEMTM, a context-enhanced multimodal topic model designed to infer coherent and interpretable topic structures from both short and long documents containing text and images. CEMTM builds on fine-tuned large vision language models (LVLMs) to obtain contextualized embeddings, and employs a distributional attention mechanism to weight token-level contributions to topic inference. A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.

  _Abraham Toluwase Owodunni, Sachin Kumar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual language models are trained on a fixed set of languages, and to support new languages, the models need to be retrained from scratch. This is an expensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to release their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued pretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation strategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original pretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually adding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining data in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address this problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of the model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting, and (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial layers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the source language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple combinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and evaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides the overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously supported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as LoRA in learning new languages. We also demonstrate that using model arithmetic, the adapted models can be equipped with strong instruction following abilities without access to any instruction tuning data in the target languages.

  In the era of large language model, relation extraction (RE) plays an important role in information extraction through the transformation of unstructured raw text into structured data (Wadhwa et al., 2023). In this paper, we systematically compare the performance of deep supervised learning approaches without transformers and those with transformers. We used a series of non-transformer architectures such as PA-LSTM(Zhang et al., 2017), C-GCN(Zhang et al., 2018), and AGGCN(attention guide GCN)(Guo et al., 2019), and a series of transformer architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and R-BERT(Wu and He, 2019). Our comparison included traditional metrics like micro F1, as well as evaluations in different scenarios, varying sentence lengths, and different percentages of the dataset for training. Our experiments were conducted on TACRED, TACREV, and RE-TACRED. The results show that transformer-based models outperform non-transformer models, achieving micro F1 scores of 80-90% compared to 64-67% for non-transformer models. Additionally, we briefly review the research journey in supervised relation classification and discuss the role and current status of large language models (LLMs) in relation extraction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical commonsense reasoning datasets like PIQA are predominantly English-centric and lack cultural diversity. We introduce Ko-PIQA, a Korean physical commonsense reasoning dataset that incorporates cultural context. Starting from 3.01 million web-crawled questions, we employed a multi-stage filtering approach using three language models to identify 11,553 PIQA-style questions. Through GPT-4o refinement and human validation, we obtained 441 high-quality question-answer pairs. A key feature of Ko-PIQA is its cultural grounding: 19.7\% of questions contain culturally specific elements like traditional Korean foods (kimchi), clothing (hanbok), and specialized appliances (kimchi refrigerators) that require culturally-aware reasoning beyond direct translation. We evaluate seven language models on Ko-PIQA, with the best model achieving 83.22\% accuracy while the weakest reaches only 59.86\%, demonstrating significant room for improvement. Models particularly struggle with culturally specific scenarios, highlighting the importance of culturally diverse datasets. Ko-PIQA serves as both a benchmark for Korean language models and a foundation for more inclusive commonsense reasoning research. The dataset and code will be publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to generate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By deploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline frequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve substantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment required to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025 outlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting the numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable guidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we distil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot approaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition. We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current limitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than replace existing established individual practices around data processing and document editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt engineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic prompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to higher quality research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions: quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance. To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation. Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensuring user privacy by synthesizing data from large language models (LLMs) tuned under differential privacy (DP) has become popular recently. However, the impact of DP fine-tuned LLMs on the quality of the language and the utility of the texts they produce has not been investigated. In this work, we tune five LLMs with three corpora under four levels of privacy and assess the length, the grammatical correctness, and the lexical diversity of the text outputs they produce. We also probe the utility of the synthetic outputs in downstream classification tasks such as book genre recognition based on book descriptions and cause of death recognition based on verbal autopsies. The results indicate that LLMs tuned under stronger privacy constrains produce texts that are shorter by at least 77 %, that are less grammatically correct by at least 9 %, and are less diverse by at least 10 % in bi-gram diversity. Furthermore, the accuracy they reach in downstream classification tasks decreases, which might be detrimental to the usefulness of the generated synthetic data.

  Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution, while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized foundation for memory control in agents.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Emojis are globally used non-verbal cues in digital communication, and extensive research has examined how large language models (LLMs) understand and utilize emojis across contexts. While usually associated with friendliness or playfulness, it is observed that emojis may trigger toxic content generation in LLMs. Motivated by such a observation, we aim to investigate: (1) whether emojis can clearly enhance the toxicity generation in LLMs and (2) how to interpret this phenomenon. We begin with a comprehensive exploration of emoji-triggered LLM toxicity generation by automating the construction of prompts with emojis to subtly express toxic intent. Experiments across 5 mainstream languages on 7 famous LLMs along with jailbreak tasks demonstrate that prompts with emojis could easily induce toxicity generation. To understand this phenomenon, we conduct model-level interpretations spanning semantic cognition, sequence generation and tokenization, suggesting that emojis can act as a heterogeneous semantic channel to bypass the safety mechanisms. To pursue deeper insights, we further probe the pre-training corpus and uncover potential correlation between the emoji-related data polution with the toxicity generation behaviors. Supplementary materials provide our implementation code and data. (Warning: This paper contains potentially sensitive contents)

  This study investigates how context and emotional tone metadata influence large language model (LLM) reasoning and performance in fallacy classification tasks, particularly within political debate settings. Using data from U.S. presidential debates, we classify six fallacy types through various prompting strategies applied to the Qwen-3 (8B) model. We introduce two theoretically grounded Chain-of-Thought frameworks: Pragma-Dialectics and the Periodic Table of Arguments, and evaluate their effectiveness against a baseline prompt under three input settings: text-only, text with context, and text with both context and audio-based emotional tone metadata. Results suggest that while theoretical prompting can improve interpretability and, in some cases, accuracy, the addition of context and especially emotional tone metadata often leads to lowered performance. Emotional tone metadata biases the model toward labeling statements as \textit{Appeal to Emotion}, worsening logical reasoning. Overall, basic prompts often outperformed enhanced ones, suggesting that attention dilution from added inputs may worsen rather than improve fallacy classification in LLMs.

  Integrating argumentation mechanisms into negotiation dialogue systems improves conflict resolution through exchanges of arguments and critiques. Moreover, incorporating personality attributes enhances adaptability by aligning interactions with individuals' preferences and styles. To advance these capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, we propose a novel Personality-driven Argumentation-based Negotiation Dialogue Generation (PAN-DG) task. To support this task, we introduce PACT, a dataset of Personality-driven Argumentation-based negotiation Conversations for Tourism sector. This dataset, generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), features three distinct personality profiles, viz. Argumentation Profile, Preference Profile, and Buying Style Profile to simulate a variety of negotiation scenarios involving diverse personalities. Thorough automatic and manual evaluations indicate that the dataset comprises high-quality dialogues. Further, we conduct comparative experiments between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs for the PAN-DG task. Multi-dimensional evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned LLMs effectively generate personality-driven rational responses during negotiations. This underscores the effectiveness of PACT in enhancing personalization and reasoning capabilities in negotiation dialogue systems, thereby establishing a foundation for future research in this domain.

  Language model (LM) benchmarking faces several challenges: comprehensive evaluations are costly, benchmarks often fail to measure the intended capabilities, and evaluation quality can degrade due to labeling errors and benchmark saturation. Although various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these issues, they tend to address individual aspects in isolation, neglecting broader questions about overall evaluation quality. Here, we introduce Fluid Benchmarking, a new evaluation approach that advances LM benchmarking across multiple dimensions. Inspired by psychometrics, Fluid Benchmarking is based on the insight that the relative value of benchmark items depends on an LM's capability level, suggesting that evaluation should adapt to each LM. Methodologically, Fluid Benchmarking estimates an item response model based on existing LM evaluation results and uses the inferred quantities to select evaluation items dynamically, similar to computerized adaptive testing in education. In our experiments, we compare Fluid Benchmarking against the common practice of random item sampling as well as more sophisticated baselines, including alternative methods grounded in item response theory. We examine four dimensions -- efficiency, validity, variance, and saturation -- and find that Fluid Benchmarking achieves superior performance in all of them (e.g., higher validity and less variance on MMLU with fifty times fewer items). Our analysis shows that the two components of Fluid Benchmarking have distinct effects: item response theory, used to map performance into a latent ability space, increases validity, while dynamic item selection reduces variance. Overall, our results suggest that LM benchmarking can be substantially improved by moving beyond static evaluation.

  With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a variety of vision-language tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on objective visual question answering or captioning, inadequately assessing the models' ability to understand complex and subjective human emotions. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmoBench-Reddit, a novel, hierarchical benchmark for multimodal emotion understanding. The dataset comprises 350 meticulously curated samples from the social media platform Reddit, each containing an image, associated user-provided text, and an emotion category (sad, humor, sarcasm, happy) confirmed by user flairs. We designed a hierarchical task framework that progresses from basic perception to advanced cognition, with each data point featuring six multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question of increasing difficulty. Perception tasks evaluate the model's ability to identify basic visual elements (e.g., colors, objects), while cognition tasks require scene reasoning, intent understanding, and deep empathy integrating textual context. We ensured annotation quality through a combination of AI assistance (Claude 4) and manual verification.

  The proliferation of clickbait headlines poses significant challenges to the credibility of information and user trust in digital media. While recent advances in machine learning have improved the detection of manipulative content, the lack of explainability limits their practical adoption. This paper presents a model for explainable clickbait detection that not only identifies clickbait titles but also attributes them to specific linguistic manipulation strategies. We introduce a synthetic dataset generated by systematically augmenting real news headlines using a predefined catalogue of clickbait strategies. This dataset enables controlled experimentation and detailed analysis of model behaviour. We present a two-stage framework for automatic clickbait analysis comprising detection and tactic attribution. In the first stage, we compare a fine-tuned BERT classifier with large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.0 and Gemini 2.4 Flash, under both zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting enriched with illustrative clickbait headlines and their associated persuasive tactics. In the second stage, a dedicated BERT-based classifier predicts the specific clickbait strategies present in each headline. This work advances the development of transparent and trustworthy AI systems for combating manipulative media content. We share the dataset with the research community atthis https URL

  In this paper, we introduce Spotlight, a novel paradigm for information extraction that produces concise, engaging narratives by highlighting the most compelling aspects of a document. Unlike traditional summaries, which prioritize comprehensive coverage, spotlights selectively emphasize intriguing content to foster deeper reader engagement with the source material. We formally differentiate spotlights from related constructs and support our analysis with a detailed benchmarking study using new datasets curated for this work. To generate high-quality spotlights, we propose a two-stage approach: fine-tuning a large language model on our benchmark data, followed by alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the resulting model not only identifies key elements with precision but also enhances readability and boosts the engagement value of the original document.

  Cultural competence, defined as the ability to understand and adapt to multicultural contexts, is increasingly vital for large language models (LLMs) in global environments. While several cultural benchmarks exist to assess LLMs' cultural competence, current evaluations suffer from fragmented taxonomies, domain specificity, and heavy reliance on manual data annotation. To address these limitations, we introduce CultureSynth, a novel framework comprising (1) a comprehensive hierarchical multilingual cultural taxonomy covering 12 primary and 130 secondary topics, and (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methodology leveraging factual knowledge to synthesize culturally relevant question-answer pairs. The CultureSynth-7 synthetic benchmark contains 19,360 entries and 4,149 manually verified entries across 7 languages. Evaluation of 14 prevalent LLMs of different sizes reveals clear performance stratification led by ChatGPT-4o-Latest and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that a 3B-parameter threshold is necessary for achieving basic cultural competence, models display varying architectural biases in knowledge processing, and significant geographic disparities exist across models. We believe that CultureSynth offers a scalable framework for developing culturally aware AI systems while reducing reliance on manual annotation\footnote{Benchmark is available atthis https URL.}.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition, multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility. Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving alternative to using sensitive clinical notes.

  _Shaohua Fang, Yue Li, Yan Cong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sentences with multiple quantifiers often lead to interpretive ambiguities, which can vary across languages. This study adopts a cross-linguistic approach to examine how large language models (LLMs) handle quantifier scope interpretation in English and Chinese, using probabilities to assess interpretive likelihood. Human similarity (HS) scores were used to quantify the extent to which LLMs emulate human performance across language groups. Results reveal that most LLMs prefer the surface scope interpretations, aligning with human tendencies, while only some differentiate between English and Chinese in the inverse scope preferences, reflecting human-similar patterns. HS scores highlight variability in LLMs' approximation of human behavior, but their overall potential to align with humans is notable. Differences in model architecture, scale, and particularly models' pre-training data language background, significantly influence how closely LLMs approximate human quantifier scope interpretations.

  Effective long-term memory in conversational AI requires synthesizing information across multiple sessions. However, current systems place excessive reasoning burden on response generation, making performance significantly dependent on model sizes. We introduce PREMem (Pre-storage Reasoning for Episodic Memory), a novel approach that shifts complex reasoning processes from inference to memory construction. PREMem extracts fine-grained memory fragments categorized into factual, experiential, and subjective information; it then establishes explicit relationships between memory items across sessions, capturing evolution patterns like extensions, transformations, and implications. By performing this reasoning during pre-storage rather than when generating a response, PREMem creates enriched representations while reducing computational demands during interactions. Experiments show significant performance improvements across all model sizes, with smaller models achieving results comparable to much larger baselines while maintaining effectiveness even with constrained token budgets.

  _Xiaohui Rao, Hanlin Wu, Zhenguang G. Cai_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI companions become capable of human-like communication, including telling jokes, understanding how people cognitively and emotionally respond to AI humor becomes increasingly important. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to compare how people process humor from AI versus human sources. Behavioral analysis revealed that participants rated AI and human humor as comparably funny. However, neurophysiological data showed that AI humor elicited a smaller N400 effect, suggesting reduced cognitive effort during the processing of incongruity. This was accompanied by a larger Late Positive Potential (LPP), indicating a greater degree of surprise and emotional response. This enhanced LPP likely stems from the violation of low initial expectations regarding AI's comedic capabilities. Furthermore, a key temporal dynamic emerged: human humor showed habituation effects, marked by an increasing N400 and a decreasing LPP over time. In contrast, AI humor demonstrated increasing processing efficiency and emotional reward, with a decreasing N400 and an increasing LPP. This trajectory reveals how the brain can dynamically update its predictive model of AI capabilities. This process of cumulative reinforcement challenges "algorithm aversion" in humor, as it demonstrates how cognitive adaptation to AI's language patterns can lead to an intensified emotional reward. Additionally, participants' social attitudes toward AI modulated these neural responses, with higher perceived AI trustworthiness correlating with enhanced emotional engagement. These findings indicate that the brain responds to AI humor with surprisingly positive and intense reactions, highlighting humor's potential for fostering genuine engagement in human-AI social interaction.

  _Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Domain-specific embedding models have shown promise for applications that require specialized semantic understanding, such as coding agents and financial retrieval systems, often achieving higher performance gains than general models. However, state-of-the-art embedding models are typically based on LLMs, which contain billions of parameters, making deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments. Model compression through pruning offers a promising solution, but existing pruning methods treat all parameters uniformly, failing to distinguish between general semantic representations and domain-specific patterns, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. Thus, we propose GAPrune, a pruning framework that addresses this challenge by considering both domain importance and preserving general linguistic foundation. Our method uses Fisher Information to measure importance and general-domain gradient alignment to assess parameter behavior, then combines these signals using our Domain Alignment Importance (DAI) scoring. Lower DAI scores indicate that the parameter is either less important for the domain task or creates conflicts between domain and general objectives. Experiments on two domain benchmarks, FinMTEB and ChemTEB, show that GAPrune maintains performance within 2.5% of dense models in one-shot pruning at 50% sparsity, while outperforming all baselines. With retraining in 100 steps, GAPrune achieves +4.51% improvement on FinMTEB and +1.73% on ChemTEB, demonstrating that our pruning strategy not only preserves but enhances domain-specific capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that principled pruning strategies can achieve model compression and enhanced domain specialization, providing the research community with a new approach for development.

  _Can Wang, Yiqun Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in biomedical and clinical applications, motivating rigorous evaluation of their ability to answer nuanced, evidence-based questions. We curate a multi-source benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize model performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) utilize key-value (KV) cache to store historical information during sequence processing. The size of KV cache grows linearly as the length of the sequence extends, which seriously affects memory usage and decoding efficiency. Current methods for KV cache eviction typically utilize the last window from the pre-filling phase as queries to compute the KV importance scores for eviction. Although this scheme is simple to implement, it tends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect or omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose Judge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This method only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By concatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train these tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that of the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the soft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the importance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining decoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our method exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction approaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks including LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Results indicate an improvement of approximately 1 point on the LongBench and over 3 points on RULER. This proposed methodology can be seamlessly integrated into existing open-source models with minimal training overhead, thereby enhancing performance in KV cache eviction scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models in healthcare often miss critical emotional cues, delivering medically sound but emotionally flat advice. This is especially problematic in clinical contexts where patients are distressed and vulnerable, and require empathic communication to support safety, adherence, and trust. We present RECAP (Reflect-Extract-Calibrate-Align-Produce), an inference-time framework that adds structured emotional reasoning without retraining. By decomposing empathy into transparent appraisal-theoretic stages and exposing per-dimension Likert signals, RECAP produces nuanced, auditable responses. Across EmoBench, SECEU, and EQ-Bench, RECAP improves emotional reasoning by 22-28% on 8B models and 10-13% on larger models over zero-shot baselines. Clinician evaluations further confirm superior empathetic communication. RECAP shows that modular, theory-grounded prompting can systematically enhance emotional intelligence in medical AI while preserving the accountability required for deployment.

  As scientific knowledge grows at an unprecedented pace, evaluation benchmarks must evolve to reflect new discoveries and ensure language models are tested on current, diverse literature. We propose a scalable, modular framework for generating multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) benchmarks directly from large corpora of scientific papers. Our pipeline automates every stage of MCQA creation, including PDF parsing, semantic chunking, question generation, and model evaluation. As a case study, we generate more than 16,000 MCQs from 22,000 open-access articles in radiation and cancer biology. We then evaluate a suite of small language models (1.1B-14B parameters) on these questions, comparing baseline accuracy with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from paper-derived semantic chunks and from reasoning traces distilled from GPT-4.1. We find that reasoning-trace retrieval consistently improves performance on both synthetic and expert-annotated benchmarks, enabling several small models to surpass GPT-4 on the 2023 Astro Radiation and Cancer Biology exam.

  Despite widespread success in language understanding and generation, large language models (LLMs) exhibit unclear and often inconsistent behavior when faced with tasks that require probabilistic reasoning. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs over explicit discrete probability distributions. Given observations from a probability distribution, we evaluate models on three carefully designed tasks, mode identification, maximum likelihood estimation, and sample generation, by prompting them to provide responses to queries about either the joint distribution or its conditionals. These tasks thus probe a range of probabilistic skills, including frequency analysis, marginalization, and generative behavior. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that there exists a clear performance gap between smaller and larger models, with the latter demonstrating stronger inference and surprising capabilities in sample generation. Furthermore, our investigations reveal notable limitations, including sensitivity to variations in the notation utilized to represent probabilistic outcomes and performance degradation of over 60% as context length increases. Together, our results provide a detailed understanding of the probabilistic reasoning abilities of LLMs and identify key directions for future improvement.

  Disinformation spreads rapidly across linguistic boundaries, yet most AI models are still benchmarked only on English. We address this gap with a systematic comparison of five multilingual transformer models: mBERT, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, RemBERT, and mT5 on a common fake-vs-true machine learning classification task. While transformer-based language models have demonstrated notable success in detecting disinformation in English, their effectiveness in multilingual contexts still remains up for debate. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce PolyTruth Disinfo Corpus, a novel corpus of 60,486 statement pairs (false claim vs. factual correction) spanning over twenty five languages that collectively cover five language families and a broad topical range from politics, health, climate, finance, and conspiracy, half of which are fact-checked disinformation claims verified by an augmented MindBugs Discovery dataset. Our experiments revealed performance variations. Models such as RemBERT achieved better overall accuracy, particularly excelling in low-resource languages, whereas models like mBERT and XLM exhibit considerable limitations when training data is scarce. We provide a discussion of these performance patterns and implications for real-world deployment. The dataset is publicly available on our GitHub repository to encourage further experimentation and advancement. Our findings illuminate both the potential and the current limitations of AI systems for multilingual disinformation detection.

  Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is essential for training large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing critical capabilities such as instruction following and in-context learning. Nevertheless, creating suitable training datasets tailored for specific domains remains challenging due to unique domain constraints and data scarcity. In this paper, we propose SearchInstruct, an innovative method explicitly designed to construct high quality instruction datasets for SFT. Our approach begins with a limited set of domain specific, human generated questions, which are systematically expanded using a large language model. Subsequently, domain relevant resources are dynamically retrieved to generate accurate and contextually appropriate answers for each augmented question. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SearchInstruct enhances both the diversity and quality of SFT datasets, leading to measurable improvements in LLM performance within specialized domains. Additionally, we show that beyond dataset generation, the proposed method can also effectively facilitate tasks such as model editing, enabling efficient updates to existing models. To facilitate reproducibility and community adoption, we provide full implementation details, the complete set of generated instruction response pairs, and the source code in a publicly accessible Git repository: [this https URL](this https URL)

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their remarkable capabilities in text generation and reasoning. However, these models face critical challenges when deployed in real-world applications, including hallucination generation, outdated knowledge, and limited domain expertise. Retrieval And Structuring (RAS) Augmented Generation addresses these limitations by integrating dynamic information retrieval with structured knowledge representations. This survey (1) examines retrieval mechanisms including sparse, dense, and hybrid approaches for accessing external knowledge; (2) explore text structuring techniques such as taxonomy construction, hierarchical classification, and information extraction that transform unstructured text into organized representations; and (3) investigate how these structured representations integrate with LLMs through prompt-based methods, reasoning frameworks, and knowledge embedding techniques. It also identifies technical challenges in retrieval efficiency, structure quality, and knowledge integration, while highlighting research opportunities in multimodal retrieval, cross-lingual structures, and interactive systems. This comprehensive overview provides researchers and practitioners with insights into RAS methods, applications, and future directions.

  Differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation is a promising technique for utilizing private datasets that otherwise cannot be exposed for model training or other analytics. While much research literature has focused on generating private unstructured text and image data, in enterprise settings, structured data (e.g., tabular) is more common, often including natural language fields or components. Existing synthetic data evaluation techniques (e.g., FID) struggle to capture the structural properties and correlations of such datasets. In this work, we propose Struct-Bench, a framework and benchmark for evaluating synthetic datasets derived from structured datasets that contain natural language data. The Struct-Bench framework requires users to provide a representation of their dataset structure as a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Our benchmark comprises 5 real-world and 2 synthetically generated datasets, each annotated with CFGs. We show that these datasets demonstrably present a great challenge even for state-of-the-art DP synthetic data generation methods. Struct-Bench also includes reference implementations of different metrics and a leaderboard, thereby providing researchers a standardized evaluation platform to benchmark and investigate privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methods. Further, we also present a case study showing how to use Struct-Bench to improve the synthetic data quality of Private Evolution (PE) on structured data. The benchmark and the leaderboard have been publicly made available atthis https URL.

  As large language models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare, ensuring their outputs reflect the diverse values and perspectives held across populations is critical. However, existing alignment approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach, EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other high-stakes domains.

  The behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when facing contextual information that conflicts with their internal parametric knowledge is inconsistent, with no generally accepted explanation for the expected outcome distribution. Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting information.

  Computational morphology has the potential to support language documentation through tasks like morphological segmentation and the generation of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT). However, our research outputs have seen limited use in real-world language documentation settings. This position paper situates the disconnect between computational morphology and language documentation within a broader misalignment between research and practice in NLP and argues that the field risks becoming decontextualized and ineffectual without systematic integration of User-Centered Design (UCD). To demonstrate how principles from UCD can reshape the research agenda, we present a case study of GlossLM, a state-of-the-art multilingual IGT generation model. Through a small-scale user study with three documentary linguists, we find that despite strong metric based performance, the system fails to meet core usability needs in real documentation contexts. These insights raise new research questions around model constraints, label standardization, segmentation, and personalization. We argue that centering users not only produces more effective tools, but surfaces richer, more relevant research directions

  Do large language models (LLMs) anticipate when they will answer correctly? To study this, we extract activations after a question is read but before any tokens are generated, and train linear probes to predict whether the model's forthcoming answer will be correct. Across three open-source model families ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters, projections on this "in-advance correctness direction" trained on generic trivia questions predict success in distribution and on diverse out-of-distribution knowledge datasets, outperforming black-box baselines and verbalised predicted confidence. Predictive power saturates in intermediate layers, suggesting that self-assessment emerges mid-computation. Notably, generalisation falters on questions requiring mathematical reasoning. Moreover, for models responding "I don't know", doing so strongly correlates with the probe score, indicating that the same direction also captures confidence. By complementing previous results on truthfulness and other behaviours obtained with probes and sparse auto-encoders, our work contributes essential findings to elucidate LLM internals.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial applications, yet existing red-teaming research primarily targets harmful content, largely neglecting regulatory risks. In this work, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of financial LLMs through red-teaming approaches. We introduce Risk-Concealment Attacks (RCA), a novel multi-turn framework that iteratively conceals regulatory risks to provoke seemingly compliant yet regulatory-violating responses from LLMs. To enable systematic evaluation, we construct FIN-Bench, a domain-specific benchmark for assessing LLM safety in financial contexts. Extensive experiments on FIN-Bench demonstrate that RCA effectively bypasses nine mainstream LLMs, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 93.18%, including 98.28% on GPT-4.1 and 97.56% on OpenAI o1. These findings reveal a critical gap in current alignment techniques and underscore the urgent need for stronger moderation mechanisms in financial domains. We hope this work offers practical insights for advancing robust and domain-aware LLM alignment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.

  Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking. Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data, alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology. Samples are provided under:this http URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap, existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

  We introduce AraHealthQA 2025, the Comprehensive Arabic Health Question Answering Shared Task, held in conjunction with ArabicNLP 2025 (co-located with EMNLP 2025). This shared task addresses the paucity of high-quality Arabic medical QA resources by offering two complementary tracks: MentalQA, focusing on Arabic mental health Q&A (e.g., anxiety, depression, stigma reduction), and MedArabiQ, covering broader medical domains such as internal medicine, pediatrics, and clinical decision making.

  The rapid advancement of speech-to-speech (S2S) large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved real-time spoken interaction. However, current evaluation frameworks remain inadequate for assessing performance in complex, multi-turn dialogues. To address this, we introduce MTalk-Bench, a multi-turn S2S benchmark covering three core dimensions: Semantic Information, Paralinguistic Information, and Ambient Sound. Each dimension includes nine realistic scenarios, along with targeted tasks to assess specific capabilities such as reasoning. Our dual-method evaluation framework combines Arena-style evaluation (pairwise comparison) and Rubrics-based evaluation (absolute scoring) for relative and absolute assessment. The benchmark includes both model and human outputs, evaluated by human evaluators and LLMs. Experimental results reveal two sets of findings. Overall performance of S2S LLMs: (1) models excel at semantic information processing yet underperform on paralinguistic information and ambient sounds perception; (2) models typically regain coherence by increasing response length, sacrificing efficiency in multi-turn dialogues; (3) modality-aware, task-specific designs outperform brute scaling. Evaluation framework and reliability: (1) Arena and Rubrics yield consistent, complementary rankings, but reliable distinctions emerge only when performance gaps are large; (2) LLM-as-a-judge aligns with humans when gaps are clear or criteria explicit, but exhibits position and length biases and is reliable on nonverbal evaluation only with text annotations. These results highlight current limitations in S2S evaluation and the need for more robust, speech-aware assessment frameworks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but pose risks of inadvertently exposing copyrighted or proprietary data, especially when such data is used for training but not intended for distribution. Traditional methods address these leaks only after content is generated, which can lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This study introduces a proactive approach: examining LLMs' internal states before text generation to detect potential leaks. By using a curated dataset of copyrighted materials, we trained a neural network classifier to identify risks, allowing for early intervention by stopping the generation process or altering outputs to prevent disclosure. Integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this framework ensures adherence to copyright and licensing requirements while enhancing data privacy and ethical standards. Our results show that analyzing internal states effectively mitigates the risk of copyrighted data leakage, offering a scalable solution that fits smoothly into AI workflows, ensuring compliance with copyright regulations while maintaining high-quality text generation.

  Model compression through post-training pruning offers a way to reduce model size and computational requirements without significantly impacting model performance. However, the effect of pruning on the fairness of LLM-generated summaries remains unexplored, particularly for opinion summarisation where biased outputs could influence publicthis http URLthis paper, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis of opinion summarisation, examining three state-of-the-art pruning methods and various calibration sets across three open-source LLMs using four fairness metrics. Our systematic analysis reveals that pruning methods have a greater impact on fairness than calibration sets. Building on these insights, we propose High Gradient Low Activation (HGLA) pruning, which identifies and removes parameters that are redundant for input processing but influential in output generation. Our experiments demonstrate that HGLA can better maintain or even improve fairness compared to existing methods, showing promise across models and tasks where traditional methods have limitations. Our human evaluation shows HGLA-generated outputs are fairer than existing state-of-the-art pruning methods. Code is available at:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit \textbf{anthropomorphism} characteristics -- human-like qualities portrayed across their outlook, language, behavior, and reasoning functions. Such characteristics enable more intuitive and engaging human-AI interactions. However, current research on anthropomorphism remains predominantly risk-focused, emphasizing over-trust and user deception while offering limited design guidance. We argue that anthropomorphism should instead be treated as a \emph{concept of design} that can be intentionally tuned to support user goals. Drawing from multiple disciplines, we propose that the anthropomorphism of an LLM-based artifact should reflect the interaction between artifact designers and interpreters. This interaction is facilitated by cues embedded in the artifact by the designers and the (cognitive) responses of the interpreters to the cues. Cues are categorized into four dimensions: \textit{perceptive, linguistic, behavioral}, and \textit{cognitive}. By analyzing the manifestation and effectiveness of each cue, we provide a unified taxonomy with actionable levers for practitioners. Consequently, we advocate for function-oriented evaluations of anthropomorphic design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing, which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs. The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover, LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities through two complementary paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which enhances knowledge grounding, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which optimizes complex reasoning abilities. However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model (LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets.

  The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling, calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who should be talking at every point in time, and for how long? In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that, perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less. Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance -- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology. Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI communication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains, which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data. We make our high-quality synthetic data publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.

  Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}), e.g. ChatGPT, have been widely adopted in real-world dialogue applications. However, LLMs' robustness, especially in handling long complex dialogue sessions, including frequent motivation transfer, sophisticated cross-turn dependency, is criticized all along. Nevertheless, no existing benchmarks can fully reflect these weaknesses. We present \textbf{MARS-Bench}, a \textbf{M}ulti-turn \textbf{A}thletic \textbf{R}eal-world \textbf{S}cenario Dialogue \textbf{Bench}mark, designed to remedy the gap. MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary so to feature realistic dialogues specifically designed to evaluate three critical aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn, and Cross-turn Tasks. Extensive experiments on MARS-Bench also reveal that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform open-source alternatives, explicit reasoning significantly boosts LLMs' robustness on handling long complex dialogue sessions, and LLMs indeed face significant challenges when handling motivation transfer and sophisticated cross-turn dependency. Moreover, we provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation when handling long complex dialogue sessions based on attention visualization experiment in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction.

  Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

  LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, yet standard benchmarks typically report performance using a single prompt, raising concerns about the reliability of such evaluations. In this work, we argue for a stochastic method of moments evaluation over the space of meaning-preserving prompt perturbations. We introduce a formal definition of reliable evaluation that accounts for prompt sensitivity, and suggest ReliableEval - a method for estimating the number of prompt resamplings needed to obtain meaningful results. Using our framework, we stochastically evaluate five frontier LLMs and find that even top-performing models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit substantial prompt sensitivity. Our approach is model-, task-, and metric-agnostic, offering a recipe for meaningful and robust LLM evaluation.

  The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments. However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper, we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information. Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing baseline.

  The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models. Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation between various attack features across different languages and propose Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages: First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting strong language transfer capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve the quality of synthetic data, we integrate two complementary strategies, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC), to enhance both reasoning capability and discriminative power. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoG surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multi-hop and domain-specific question answering, while achieving competitive performance on long-context reading comprehension. These results highlight the superior generalization ability of SoG. Our work advances the paradigm of synthetic data generation and offers practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, particularly for downstream tasks and domains with limited training data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7" over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the required capabilities.

  The hallucination of non-existent facts by LLMs is an important problem given its widespread adoption across various applications. Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence.

We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25\% in average precision.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Latin script is often used to informally write languages with non-Latin native scripts. In many cases (e.g., most languages in India), the lack of conventional spelling in the Latin script results in high spelling variability. Such romanization renders languages that are normally easily distinguished due to being written in different scripts - Hindi and Urdu, for example - highly confusable. In this work, we increase language identification (LID) accuracy for romanized text by improving the methods used to synthesize training sets. We find that training on synthetic samples which incorporate natural spelling variation yields higher LID system accuracy than including available naturally occurring examples in the training set, or even training higher capacity models. We demonstrate new state-of-the-art LID performance on romanized text from 20 Indic languages in the Bhasha-Abhijnaanam evaluation set (Madhani et al., 2023a), improving test F1 from the reported 74.7% (using a pretrained neural model) to 85.4% using a linear classifier trained solely on synthetic data and 88.2% when also training on available harvested text.

In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o, Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts. Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual understanding capabilities of current LLMs.

  _Kang He, Kaushik Roy_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

  _Yuya Ogasa, Yuki Arase_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study addresses the problem of hallucinated span detection in the outputs of large language models. It has received less attention than output-level hallucination detection despite its practical importance. Prior work has shown that attentions often exhibit irregular patterns when hallucinations occur. Motivated by these findings, we extract features from the attention matrix that provide complementary views capturing (a) whether certain tokens are influential or ignored, (b) whether attention is biased toward specific subsets, and (c) whether a token is generated referring to a narrow or broad context, in the generation. These features are input to a Transformer-based classifier to conduct sequential labelling to identify hallucinated spans. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines on hallucinated span detection with longer input contexts, such as data-to-text and summarisation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing emotional stress in modern society has increased the demand for Emotional Support Conversations (ESC). While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for ESC, they face two key challenges: (1) low strategy selection accuracy, and (2) preference bias, limiting their adaptability to emotional needs of users. Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles to address these issues, as it rigidly trains models on single gold-standard responses without modeling nuanced strategy trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Strategy Optimization (CSO), a novel approach that optimizes strategy selection preferences at each dialogue turn. We first leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct ESC-Pro, a high-quality preference dataset with turn-level strategy-response pairs. Training on ESC-Pro with CSO improves both strategy accuracy and bias mitigation, enabling LLMs to generate more empathetic and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9B, and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that CSO outperforms standard SFT, highlighting the efficacy of fine-grained, turn-level preference modeling in ESC.

  _Yurui Chang, Bochuan Cao, Lu Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, they remain susceptible to hallucinations -- generating plausible yet factually incorrect contents. Existing methods to mitigating such risk often rely on sampling multiple full-length generations, which introduces significant response latency and becomes ineffective when the model consistently produces hallucinated outputs with high confidence. To address these limitations, we introduce Monitoring Decoding (MD), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the generation process and selectively applies in-process interventions, focusing on revising crucial tokens responsible for hallucinations. Instead of waiting until completion of multiple full-length generations, we identify hallucination-prone tokens during generation using a monitor function, and further refine these tokens through a tree-based decoding strategy. This approach ensures an enhanced factual accuracy and coherence in the generated output while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MD consistently outperforms self-consistency-based approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher factual accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance on tasks requiring complex linguistic abilities, such as reference disambiguation and metaphor recognition/generation. Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Prior research on linguistic mechanisms is limited by coarse granularity, limited analysis scale, and narrow focus. In this study, we propose LinguaLens, a systematic and comprehensive framework for analyzing the linguistic mechanisms of large language models, based on Sparse Auto-Encoders (SAEs). We extract a broad set of Chinese and English linguistic features across four dimensions (morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics). By employing counterfactual methods, we construct a large-scale counterfactual dataset of linguistic features for mechanism analysis. Our findings reveal intrinsic representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs, uncover patterns of cross-layer and cross-lingual distribution, and demonstrate the potential to control model outputs. This work provides a systematic suite of resources and methods for studying linguistic mechanisms, offers strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge, and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models are increasingly responsible for online content, concerns arise about the impact of repeatedly processing their own outputs. Inspired by the "broken telephone" effect in chained human communication, this study investigates whether LLMs similarly distort information through iterative generation. Through translation-based experiments, we find that distortion accumulates over time, influenced by language choice and chain complexity. While degradation is inevitable, it can be mitigated through strategic prompting techniques. These findings contribute to discussions on the long-term effects of AI-mediated information propagation, raising important questions about the reliability of LLM-generated content in iterative workflows.

  _Zhiwei Liu, Kailai Yang, Eduard Hovy, Sophia Ananiadou_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread dissemination of rumors on social media has a significant impact on people's lives, potentially leading to public panic and fear. Rumors often evoke specific sentiments, resonating with readers and prompting sharing. To effectively detect and track rumors, it is essential to observe the fine-grained sentiments of both source and response message pairs as the rumor evolves over time. However, current rumor detection methods fail to account for this aspect. In this paper, we propose MSuf, the first multi-task suffix learning framework for rumor detection and tracking using time series dual (coupled) sentiments. MSuf includes three modules: (1) an LLM to extract sentiment intensity features and sort them chronologically; (2) a module that fuses the sorted sentiment features with their source text word embeddings to obtain an aligned embedding; (3) two hard prompts are combined with the aligned vector to perform rumor detection and sentiment analysis using one frozen LLM. MSuf effectively enhances the performance of LLMs for rumor detection with only minimal parameter fine-tuning. Evaluating MSuf on four rumor detection benchmarks, we find significant improvements compared to other emotion-based methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer based models, specially large language models (LLMs) dominate the field of NLP with their mass adoption in tasks such as text generation, summarization and fake news detection. These models offer ease of deployment and reliability for most applications, however, they require significant amounts of computational power for training as well as inference. This poses challenges in their adoption in resource-constrained applications, specially in the open-source community where compute availability is usually scarce. This work proposes a graph-based approach for Environmental Claim Detection, exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) as lightweight yet effective alternatives to transformer-based models. Re-framing the task as a graph classification problem, we transform claim sentences into dependency parsing graphs, utilizing a combination of word2vec \& learnable part-of-speech (POS) tag embeddings for the node features and encoding syntactic dependencies in the edge relations. Our results show that our graph-based models, particularly HGNNs in the poincar√© space (P-HGNNs), achieve performance superior to the state-of-the-art on environmental claim detection while using upto \textbf{30x fewer parameters}. We also demonstrate that HGNNs benefit vastly from explicitly modeling data in hierarchical (tree-like) structures, enabling them to significantly improve over their euclidean counterparts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models continue to scale, computational costs and resource consumption have emerged as significant challenges. While existing sparsification methods like pruning reduce computational overhead, they risk losing model knowledge through parameter removal. This paper proposes DSMoE (Dynamic Sparse Mixture-of-Experts), a novel approach that achieves sparsification by partitioning pre-trained FFN layers into computational blocks. We implement adaptive expert routing using sigmoid activation and straight-through estimators, enabling tokens to flexibly access different aspects of model knowledge based on input complexity. Additionally, we introduce a sparsity loss term to balance performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on LLaMA models demonstrate that under equivalent computational constraints, DSMoE achieves superior performance compared to existing pruning and MoE approaches across language modeling and downstream tasks, particularly excelling in generation tasks. Analysis reveals that DSMoE learns distinctive layerwise activation patterns, providing new insights for future MoE architecture design.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the generation of emotional support conversations (ESC), offering scalable solutions with reduced costs and enhanced data privacy. This paper explores the role of personas in the creation of ESC by LLMs. Our research utilizes established psychological frameworks to measure and infuse persona traits into LLMs, which then generate dialogues in the emotional support scenario. We conduct extensive evaluations to understand the stability of persona traits in dialogues, examining shifts in traits post-generation and their impact on dialogue quality and strategy distribution. Experimental results reveal several notable findings: 1) LLMs can infer core persona traits, 2) subtle shifts in emotionality and extraversion occur, influencing the dialogue dynamics, and 3) the application of persona traits modifies the distribution of emotional support strategies, enhancing the relevance and empathetic quality of the responses. These findings highlight the potential of persona-driven LLMs in crafting more personalized, empathetic, and effective emotional support dialogues, which has significant implications for the future design of AI-driven emotional support systems.

  _Tu Anh Dinh, Jan Niehues_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Quality Estimation (QE) is estimating quality of the model output during inference when the ground truth is not available. Deriving output quality from the models' output probability is the most trivial and low-effort way. However, we show that the output probability of text-generation models can appear underconfident. At each output step, there can be multiple correct options, making the probability distribution spread out more. Thus, lower probability does not necessarily mean lower output quality. Due to this observation, we propose a QE approach called BoostedProb, which boosts the model's confidence in cases where there are multiple viable output options. With no increase in complexity, BoostedProb is notably better than raw model probability in different settings, achieving on average +0.194 improvement in Pearson correlation to ground-truth quality. It also comes close to or outperforms more costly approaches like supervised or ensemble-based QE in certain settings.

  _Haodi Ma, Dzmitry Kasinets, Daisy Zhe Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict missing links in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging information from various modalities alongside structural data. Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable advancements and widespread applications of deep neural networks, their ability to perform reasoning tasks remains limited, particularly in domains requiring structured, abstract thought. In this paper, we investigate the linguistic reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) by introducing IOLBENCH, a novel benchmark derived from International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) problems. This dataset encompasses diverse problems testing syntax, morphology, phonology, and semantics, all carefully designed to be self-contained and independent of external knowledge. These tasks challenge models to engage in metacognitive linguistic reasoning, requiring the deduction of linguistic rules and patterns from minimal examples. Through extensive benchmarking of leading LLMs, we find that even the most advanced models struggle to handle the intricacies of linguistic complexity, particularly in areas demanding compositional generalization and rule abstraction. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and persistent limitations of current models in linguistic problem-solving, offering valuable insights into their reasoning capabilities. By introducing IOLBENCH, we aim to foster further research into developing models capable of human-like reasoning, with broader implications for the fields of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language-driven molecule discovery. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for molecule-text alignment are predominantly built on a one-to-one mapping, measuring LLMs' ability to retrieve a single, pre-defined answer, rather than their creative potential to generate diverse, yet equally valid, molecular candidates. To address this critical gap, we propose Speak-to-Structure (S^2-Bench}), the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs in open-domain natural language-driven molecule generation. S^2-Bench is specifically designed for one-to-many relationships, challenging LLMs to demonstrate genuine molecular understanding and generation capabilities. Our benchmark includes three key tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom), each probing a different aspect of molecule discovery. We also introduce OpenMolIns, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset that enables Llama-3.1-8B to surpass the most powerful LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on S^2-Bench. Our comprehensive evaluation of 28 LLMs shifts the focus from simple pattern recall to realistic molecular design, paving the way for more capable LLMs in natural language-driven molecule discovery.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  There is a strong correlation between linguistics and artificial intelligence (AI), best manifested by deep learning language models. This study provides a thorough scientometric analysis of this correlation, synthesizing the intellectual production over 51 years, from 1974 to 2024. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was the data source. The data collected were analyzed by two powerful software, viz., CiteSpace and VOSviewer, through which mapping visualizations of the intellectual landscape, trending issues and (re)emerging hotspots were generated. The results indicate that in the 1980s and 1990s, linguistics and AI (AIL) research was not robust, characterized by unstable publication over time. It has, however, witnessed a remarkable increase of publication since then, reaching 1478 articles in 2023, and 546 articles in January-March timespan in 2024, involving emerging issues including Natural language processing, Cross-sectional study, Using bidirectional encoder representation, and Using ChatGPT and hotspots such as Novice programmer, Prioritization, and Artificial intelligence, addressing new horizons, new topics, and launching new applications and powerful deep learning language models including ChatGPT. It concludes that linguistics and AI correlation is established at several levels, research centers, journals, and countries shaping AIL knowledge production and reshaping its future frontiers.

  This study provides a comprehensive analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) contribution to research in the translation industry (ACTI), synthesizing it over forty-five years from 1980-2024. 13220 articles were retrieved from three sources, namely WoS, Scopus, and Lens; 9836 were unique records, which were used for the analysis. I provided two types of analysis, viz., scientometric and thematic, focusing on Cluster, Subject categories, Keywords, Bursts, Centrality and Research Centers as for the former. For the latter, I provided a thematic review for 18 articles, selected purposefully from the articles involved, centering on purpose, approach, findings, and contribution to ACTI future directions. This study is significant for its valuable contribution to ACTI knowledge production over 45 years, emphasizing several trending issues and hotspots including Machine translation, Statistical machine translation, Low-resource language, Large language model, Arabic dialects, Translation quality, and Neural machine translation. The findings reveal that the more AI develops, the more it contributes to translation industry, as Neural Networking Algorithms have been incorporated and Deep Language Learning Models like ChatGPT have been launched. However, much rigorous research is still needed to overcome several problems encountering translation industry, specifically concerning low-resource, multi-dialectical and free word order languages, and cultural and religious registers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ambiguous words are often found in modern digital communications. Lexical ambiguity challenges traditional Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods, due to limited data. Consequently, the efficiency of translation, information retrieval, and question-answering systems is hindered by these limitations. This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve WSD using a novel approach combining a systematic prompt augmentation mechanism with a knowledge base (KB) consisting of different sense interpretations. The proposed method incorporates a human-in-loop approach for prompt augmentation where prompt is supported by Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, synonyms of ambiguous words, aspect-based sense filtering and few-shot prompting to guide the LLM. By utilizing a few-shot Chain of Thought (COT) prompting-based approach, this work demonstrates a substantial improvement in performance. The evaluation was conducted using FEWS test data and sense tags. This research advances accurate word interpretation in social media and digital communication.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Instruction tuning -- supervised fine-tuning using instruction-response pairs -- is a key step in making pre-trained large language models (LLMs) instructable. Meanwhile, LLMs perform multitask learning during their pre-training, acquiring extensive knowledge and capabilities. We hypothesize that the pre-training stage can enable them to develop the ability to comprehend and address instructions. To verify this, we propose Response Tuning (RT), which removes the instruction and its corresponding mapping to the response from instruction tuning. Instead, it focuses solely on establishing a response distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that RT models, trained only on responses, can effectively respond to a wide range of instructions akin to their instruction-tuned counterparts. In addition, we observe that the models can recognize and reject unsafe queries after learning a safety policy only from the response data. Furthermore, we find that these observations extend to an in-context learning setting. These findings support our hypothesis, highlighting the extensive inherent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs.

  Pre-trained large language models(LLMs) have attracted increasing attention in biomedical domains due to their success in natural language processing. However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.

  _Tong Wang, K. Sudhir, Dat Hong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enterprises deploying LLMs for goal-oriented dialogs, such as customer service, face a critical trade-off between performance, control, and cost. Proprietary models like GPT-4 offer strong performance but are costly and cannot be self-hosted, raising security and privacy concerns. Open-source alternatives offer flexibility and lower token costs but lag in performance. We introduce Guidance Elicitation and Retrieval (GER), a prompt-based knowledge distillation framework where a high-performance teacher LLM coaches a lower-performance student without modifying the student's parameters. GER extracts tactical guidance for a wide range of dialog scenarios from the teacher and stores these scenario-guidance pairs in a structured library. At inference time, the student retrieves the relevant guidance and integrates it into its prompt. While GER training can be bootstrapped entirely with synthetic data, its modular design lets it seamlessly augment the synthetic data with human conversational logs. In addition, the modular design enables easy auditing and updating of the guidance library as new scenarios and constraints emerge. Experiments show GER's guidance-based coaching outperforms both example output based fine-tuning and non-customized guidance baselines, and generalizes across other contexts and student models. The GER framework is potentially extensible to coach human service agents.

  The task of image captioning has recently been gaining popularity, and with it the complex task of evaluating the quality of image captioning models. In this work, we present the first survey and taxonomy of over 70 different image captioning metrics and their usage in hundreds of papers, specifically designed to help users select the most suitable metric for their needs. We find that despite the diversity of proposed metrics, the vast majority of studies rely on only five popular metrics, which we show to be weakly correlated with human ratings. We hypothesize that combining a diverse set of metrics can enhance correlation with human ratings. As an initial step, we demonstrate that a linear regression-based ensemble method, which we call EnsembEval, trained on one human ratings dataset, achieves improved correlation across five additional datasets, showing there is a lot of room for improvement by leveraging a diverse set of metrics.

  The moral value of liberty is a central concept in our inference system when it comes to taking a stance towards controversial social issues such as vaccine hesitancy, climate change, or the right to abortion. Here, we propose a novel Liberty lexicon evaluated on more than 3,000 manually annotated data both in in- and out-of-domain scenarios. As a result of this evaluation, we produce a combined lexicon that constitutes the main outcome of this work. This final lexicon incorporates information from an ensemble of lexicons that have been generated using word embedding similarity (WE) and compositional semantics (CS). Our key contributions include enriching the liberty annotations, developing a robust liberty lexicon for broader application, and revealing the complexity of expressions related to liberty across different platforms. Through the evaluation, we show that the difficulty of the task calls for designing approaches that combine knowledge, in an effort of improving the representations of learning systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of social media and online news sources, fake news has become a significant issue globally. However, the detection of fake news in low resource languages like Bengali has received limited attention in research. In this paper, we propose a methodology consisting of four distinct approaches to classify fake news articles in Bengali using summarization and augmentation techniques with five pre-trained language models. Our approach includes translating English news articles and using augmentation techniques to curb the deficit of fake news articles. Our research also focused on summarizing the news to tackle the token length limitation of BERT based models. Through extensive experimentation and rigorous evaluation, we show the effectiveness of summarization and augmentation in the case of Bengali fake news detection. We evaluated our models using three separate test datasets. The BanglaBERT Base model, when combined with augmentation techniques, achieved an impressive accuracy of 96% on the first test dataset. On the second test dataset, the BanglaBERT model, trained with summarized augmented news articles achieved 97% accuracy. Lastly, the mBERT Base model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the third test dataset which was reserved for generalization performance evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) have initiated a paradigm shift in transfer learning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in order to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capability of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing a kernel-regression perspective of understanding LLMs' ICL bahaviors when faced with in-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on in-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat y = \sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-context demonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors of language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden features in LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory provides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: why retrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICL performance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits from selecting in-distribution and representative samples.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Animated movies are captivating for their unique character designs and imaginative storytelling, yet they pose significant challenges for existing recognition systems. Unlike the consistent visual patterns detected by conventional face recognition methods, animated characters exhibit extreme diversity in their appearance, motion, and deformation. In this work, we propose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated character recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of animated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an audio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual exemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent multi-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions. Building on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream applications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired audiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support research in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated movies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline demonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative comprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The reliance on implicit point matching via attention has become a core bottleneck in drag-based editing, resulting in a fundamental compromise on weakened inversion strength and costly test-time optimization (TTO). This compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models, suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper, we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach: opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to editing paradigms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.

  Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt. mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples.

  This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3 and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.

  X-ray imaging is a ubiquitous in radiology, yet most existing AI foundation models are limited to chest anatomy and fail to generalize across broader clinical tasks. In this work, we introduce XR-0, the multi-anatomy X-ray foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large, private dataset of 1.15 million images spanning diverse anatomical regions and evaluated across 12 datasets and 20 downstream tasks, including classification, retrieval, segmentation, localization, visual grounding, and report generation. XR-0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most multi-anatomy tasks and remains competitive on chest-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that anatomical diversity and supervision are critical for building robust, general-purpose medical vision models, paving the way for scalable and adaptable AI systems in radiology.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines online temporal action localization with free-form description generation. Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE (Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key step in that direction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health. Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.

  _Pu Jian, Junhong Wu, Wei Sun, Chen Wang, Shuo Ren, Jiajun Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in text-only "slow-thinking" reasoning have prompted efforts to transfer this capability to vision-language models (VLMs), for training visual reasoning models (\textbf{VRMs}). owever, such transfer faces critical challenges: Effective "slow thinking" in VRMs requires \textbf{visual reflection}, the ability to check the reasoning process based on visual information. Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge, we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs, enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tram-human interaction safety is an important challenge, given that trams frequently operate in densely populated areas, where collisions can range from minor injuries to fatal outcomes. This paper addresses the issue from the perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU), while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers before dangerous situations escalate. Code available atthis https URL.

- **[FS-SAM2: Adapting Segment Anything Model 2 for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12105)**  `arXiv:2509.12105`  
  _Bernardo Forni, Gabriele Lombardi, Federico Pozzi, Mirco Planamente_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Few-shot semantic segmentation has recently attracted great attention. The goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent computational efficiency during inference.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing cardiac motion from cine CMR sequences is critical for diagnosis, prediction, and intervention. Existing methods rely on complete CMR stacks to infer full heart motion, limiting their utility in intra-procedural scenarios where only sparse observations are available. We present TetHeart, the first end-to-end framework that unifies full 4D multi-structure heart mesh recovery from both offline full-stack acquisitions and intra-procedural sparse-slice observations. Our method leverages deep deformable tetrahedra, an explicit-implicit hybrid representation, to capture shape and motion in a coherent space shared across cardiac structures. It is initialized from high-quality pre-procedural or offline-acquired full stacks to build detailed, patient-specific heart meshes, which can then be updated using whatever slices are available, from full stacks down to a single slice. We further incorporate several key innovations: (i) an attentive mechanism for slice-adaptive 2D-3D feature assembly that dynamically integrates information from arbitrary numbers of slices at any position, combined with a distillation strategy from full-slice to sparse-slice settings to ensure accurate reconstruction under extreme sparsity; and (ii) a two-stage weakly supervised motion learning scheme requiring only keyframe (e.g., ED and ES) annotations. Trained and validated on three large public datasets and externally evaluated zero-shot on additional private interventional and public CMR datasets, TetHeart achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization in both pre- and intra-procedural settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) retrieves a 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) from a single 2D compressed measurement, which is a highly challenging reconstruction task. Recent deep unfolding networks (DUNs), empowered by explicit data-fidelity updates and implicit deep denoisers, have achieved the state of the art in CASSI reconstruction. However, existing unfolding approaches suffer from uncontrollable reconstruction trajectories, leading to abrupt quality jumps and non-gradual refinement across stages. Inspired by diffusion trajectories and flow matching, we propose a novel trajectory-controllable unfolding framework that enforces smooth, continuous optimization paths from noisy initial estimates to high-quality reconstructions. To achieve computational efficiency, we design an efficient spatial-spectral Transformer tailored for hyperspectral reconstruction, along with a frequency-domain fusion module to gurantee feature consistency. Experiments on simulation and real data demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality and efficiency than prior state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is a widely used 3D imaging technique in dentistry, providing volumetric information about the anatomical structures of jaws and teeth. Accurate segmentation of these anatomies is critical for clinical applications such as diagnosis and surgical planning, but remains time-consuming and challenging. In this paper, we present U-Mamba2, a new neural network architecture designed for multi-anatomy CBCT segmentation in the context of the ToothFairy3 challenge. U-Mamba2 integrates the Mamba2 state space models into the U-Net architecture, enforcing stronger structural constraints for higher efficiency without compromising performance. In addition, we integrate interactive click prompts with cross-attention blocks, pre-train U-Mamba2 using self-supervised learning, and incorporate dental domain knowledge into the model design to address key challenges of dental anatomy segmentation in CBCT. Extensive experiments, including independent tests, demonstrate that U-Mamba2 is both effective and efficient, securing top 3 places in both tasks of the Toothfairy3 challenge. In Task 1, U-Mamba2 achieved a mean Dice of 0.792, HD95 of 93.19 with the held-out test data, with an average inference time of XX (TBC during the ODIN workshop). In Task 2, U-Mamba2 achieved the mean Dice of 0.852 and HD95 of 7.39 with the held-out test data. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The fine-grained surface reconstruction of different organs from 3D medical imaging can provide advanced diagnostic support and improved surgical planning. However, the representation of the organs is often limited by the resolution, with a detailed higher resolution requiring more memory and computing footprint. Implicit representations of objects have been proposed to alleviate this problem in general computer vision by providing compact and differentiable functions to represent the 3D object shapes. However, architectural and data-related differences prevent the direct application of these methods to medical images. This work introduces ImplMORe, an end-to-end deep learning method using implicit surface representations for multi-organ reconstruction from 3D medical images. ImplMORe incorporates local features using a 3D CNN encoder and performs multi-scale interpolation to learn the features in the continuous domain using occupancy functions. We apply our method for single and multiple organ reconstructions using the totalsegmentator dataset. By leveraging the continuous nature of occupancy functions, our approach outperforms the discrete explicit representation based surface reconstruction approaches, providing fine-grained surface details of the organ at a resolution higher than the given input image.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings.

  _Yuchen Deng, Xiuyang Wu, Hai-Tao Zheng, Suiyang Zhang, Yi He, Yuxing Han_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing talking-head animation approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or diffusion models often suffer from inter-frame flicker, identity drift, and slow inference. These limitations inherent to their video generation pipelines restrict their suitability for applications. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly text or audio input. In addition, AvatarSync adopts a two-stage generation strategy, decoupling semantic modeling from visual dynamics, which is a deliberate "Divide and Conquer" design. The first stage, Facial Keyframe Generation (FKG), focuses on phoneme-level semantic representation by leveraging the many-to-one mapping from text or audio to phonemes. A Phoneme-to-Visual Mapping is constructed to anchor abstract phonemes to character-level units. Combined with a customized Text-Frame Causal Attention Mask, the keyframes are generated. The second stage, inter-frame interpolation, emphasizes temporal coherence and visual smoothness. We introduce a timestamp-aware adaptive strategy based on a selective state space model, enabling efficient bidirectional context reasoning. To support deployment, we optimize the inference pipeline to reduce latency without compromising visual fidelity. Extensive experiments show that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.

  Animal behavior analysis plays a crucial role in understanding animal welfare, health status, and productivity in agricultural settings. However, traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS) domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

  This work presents Robust Representation Learning via Adaptive Mask (RAM++), a two-stage framework for all-in-one image restoration. RAM++ integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released atthis https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision--language models (VLMs) often process visual inputs through a pretrained vision encoder, followed by a projection into the language model's embedding space via a connector component. While crucial for modality fusion, the potential information loss induced by this projection step and its direct impact on model capabilities remain understudied. We introduce two complementary approaches to examine and quantify this loss by analyzing the latent representation space. First, we evaluate semantic information preservation by analyzing changes in k-nearest neighbor relationships between image representations, before and after projection. Second, we directly measure information loss by reconstructing visual embeddings from the projected representation, localizing loss at an image patch level. Experiments reveal that connectors substantially distort the local geometry of visual representations, with k-nearest neighbors diverging by 40--60\% post-projection, correlating with degradation in retrieval performance. The patch-level embedding reconstruction provides interpretable insights for model behavior on visually grounded question-answering tasks, finding that areas of high information loss reliably predict instances where models struggle.

  While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts, trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing, such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data augmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate land cover classification from satellite imagery is crucial in environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management. However, it remains challenging due to the complexity of natural landscapes, the visual similarity between classes, and the significant class imbalance in the available datasets. To address these issues, we propose a dual encoder architecture that independently extracts modality-specific features from optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which are then fused using a cross-modality attention-fusion module named Cross-modality Land cover segmentation with Attention and Imbalance- aware Reasoning-Enhanced Explanations (CLAIRE). This fusion mechanism highlights complementary spatial and textural features, enabling the network to better capture detailed and diverse land cover patterns. We incorporate a hybrid loss function that utilizes Weighted Focal Loss and Tversky Loss named RIFT (Rare-Instance Focal-Tversky) to address class imbalance and improve segmentation performance across underrepresented categories. Our model achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks: a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 56.02% and Overall Accuracy (OA) of 84.56% on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset; strong generalization with a mIoU of 59.89% and OA of 73.92% on the OpenEarthMap-SAR dataset; and remarkable robustness under cloud-obstructed conditions, achieving an mIoU of 86.86% and OA of 94.58% on the PIE-RGB-SAR dataset. Additionally, we introduce a metric-driven reasoning module generated by a Small Language Model (Phi-3), which generates expert-level, sample-specific justifications for model predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal learning has attracted much attention in recent years due to its ability to effectively utilize data features from a variety of different modalities. Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD strategy we proposed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Facial emotion recognition (FER) models trained only on pixels often fail to generalize across datasets because facial appearance is an indirect and biased proxy for underlying affect. We present NeuroGaze-Distill, a cross-modal distillation framework that transfers brain-informed priors into an image-only FER student via static Valence/Arousal (V/A) prototypes and a depression-inspired geometric prior (D-Geo). A teacher trained on EEG topographic maps from DREAMER (with MAHNOB-HCI as unlabeled support) produces a consolidated 5x5 V/A prototype grid that is frozen and reused; no EEG-face pairing and no non-visual signals at deployment are required. The student (ResNet-18/50) is trained on FERPlus with conventional CE/KD and two lightweight regularizers: (i) Proto-KD (cosine) aligns student features to the static prototypes; (ii) D-Geo softly shapes the embedding geometry in line with affective findings often reported in depression research (e.g., anhedonia-like contraction in high-valence regions). We evaluate both within-domain (FERPlus validation) and cross-dataset protocols (AffectNet-mini; optional CK+), reporting standard 8-way scores alongside present-only Macro-F1 and balanced accuracy to fairly handle label-set mismatch. Ablations attribute consistent gains to prototypes and D-Geo, and favor 5x5 over denser grids for stability. The method is simple, deployable, and improves robustness without architectural complexity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available atthis https URL.

  _Akito Shinohara, Kohei Fukuda, Hiroaki Aizawa_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ability to detect out-of-distribution data is essential not only for ensuring robustness against unknown or unexpected input data but also for improving the generalization performance of the model. Among various out-of-distribution detection methods, Outlier Exposure and Mixture Outlier Exposure are promising approaches that enhance out-of-distribution detection performance by exposing the outlier data during training. However, even with these sophisticated techniques, it remains challenging for models to learn the relationships between classes effectively and to distinguish data sampling from in-distribution and out-of-distribution clearly. Therefore, we focus on the logit space, where the properties between class-wise distributions are distinctly separated from those in the input or feature spaces. Specifically, we propose a linear interpolation technique in the logit space that mixes in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to facilitate smoothing logits between classes and improve the out-of-distribution detection performance, particularly for out-of-distribution data that lie close to the in-distribution data. Additionally, we enforce consistency between the logits obtained through mixing in the logit space and those generated via mixing in the input space. Our experiments demonstrate that our logit-space mixing technique reduces the abrupt fluctuations in the model outputs near the decision boundaries, resulting in smoother and more reliable separation between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a fine-grained out-of-distribution detection task.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Monocular depth estimation in bronchoscopy can significantly improve real-time navigation accuracy and enhance the safety of interventions in complex, branching airways. Recent advances in depth foundation models have shown promise for endoscopic scenarios, yet these models often lack anatomical awareness in bronchoscopy, overfitting to local textures rather than capturing the global airway structure, particularly under ambiguous depth cues and poor lighting. To address this, we propose Brea-Depth, a novel framework that integrates airway-specific geometric priors into foundation model adaptation for bronchoscopic depth estimation. Our method introduces a depth-aware CycleGAN, refining the translation between real bronchoscopic images and airway geometries from anatomical data, effectively bridging the domain gap. In addition, we introduce an airway structure awareness loss to enforce depth consistency within the airway lumen while preserving smooth transitions and structural integrity. By incorporating anatomical priors, Brea-Depth enhances model generalization and yields more robust, accurate 3D airway reconstructions. To assess anatomical realism, we introduce Airway Depth Structure Evaluation, a new metric for structural consistency. We validate BREA-Depth on a collected ex vivo human lung dataset and an open bronchoscopic dataset, where it outperforms existing methods in anatomical depth preservation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper introduces a new Segment Anything Model (SAM) that leverages reverse parameter configuration and test-time training to enhance its performance on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), named SAM-TTT. While most existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers, originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules, SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark in the field.

  Poetry is an expressive form of art that invites multiple interpretations, as readers often bring their own emotions, experiences, and cultural backgrounds into their understanding of a poem. Recognizing this, we aim to generate images for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.

  Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types.While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack.All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.

  Recent advancements in large video models (LVMs) have significantly enhance video understanding. However, these models continue to suffer from hallucinations, producing content that conflicts with input videos. To address this issue, we propose Dr.V, a hierarchical framework covering perceptive, temporal, and cognitive levels to diagnose video hallucination by fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding. Dr.V comprises of two key components: a benchmark dataset Dr.V-Bench and a satellite video agent Dr.V-Agent. Dr.V-Bench includes 10k instances drawn from 4,974 videos spanning diverse tasks, each enriched with detailed spatial-temporal annotation. Dr.V-Agent detects hallucinations in LVMs by systematically applying fine-grained spatial-temporal grounding at the perceptive and temporal levels, followed by cognitive level reasoning. This step-by-step pipeline mirrors human-like video comprehension and effectively identifies hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dr.V-Agent is effective in diagnosing hallucination while enhancing interpretability and reliability, offering a practical blueprint for robust video understanding in real-world scenarios.

  Video Question Answering (VQA) requires models to reason over spatial, temporal, and causal cues in videos. Recent vision language models (VLMs) achieve strong results but often rely on shallow correlations, leading to weak temporal grounding and limited interpretability. We study symbolic scene graphs (SGs) as intermediate grounding signals for VQA. SGs provide structured object-relation representations that complement VLMs holistic reasoning. We introduce SG-VLM, a modular framework that integrates frozen VLMs with scene graph grounding via prompting and visual localization. Across three benchmarks (NExT-QA, iVQA, ActivityNet-QA) and multiple VLMs (QwenVL, InternVL), SG-VLM improves causal and temporal reasoning and outperforms prior baselines, though gains over strong VLMs are limited. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of symbolic grounding, and offer guidance for future hybrid VLM-symbolic approaches in video understanding.

  Sparse-view synthesis remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of recovering accurate geometry and appearance from limited observations. While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time rendering with competitive quality, existing pipelines often rely on Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for camera pose estimation, an approach that struggles in genuinely sparse-view settings. Moreover, several SfM-free methods replace SfM with multi-view stereo (MVS) models, but generate massive numbers of 3D Gaussians by back-projecting every pixel into 3D space, leading to high memory costs. We propose Segmentation-Driven Initialization for Gaussian Splatting (SDI-GS), a method that mitigates inefficiency by leveraging region-based segmentation to identify and retain only structurally significant regions. This enables selective downsampling of the dense point cloud, preserving scene fidelity while substantially reducing Gaussian count. Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that SDI-GS reduces Gaussian count by up to 50% and achieves comparable or superior rendering quality in PSNR and SSIM, with only marginal degradation in LPIPS. It further enables faster training and lower memory footprint, advancing the practicality of 3DGS for constrained-view scenarios.

  Generative vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong high-level image understanding but lack spatially dense alignment between vision and language modalities, as our findings indicate. Orthogonal to advancements in generative VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.

  Semantic segmentation networks (SSNs) play a critical role in domains such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and environmental monitoring, where safety hinges on reliable model behavior under uncertainty. Yet, existing probabilistic verification approaches struggle to scale with the complexity and dimensionality of modern segmentation tasks, often yielding guarantees that are too conservative to be practical. We introduce a probabilistic verification framework that is both architecture-agnostic and scalable to high-dimensional outputs. Our approach combines sampling-based reachability analysis with conformal inference (CI) to deliver provable guarantees while avoiding the excessive conservatism of prior methods. To counteract CI's limitations in high-dimensional settings, we propose novel strategies that reduce conservatism without compromising rigor. Empirical evaluation on large-scale segmentation models across CamVid, OCTA-500, Lung Segmentation, and Cityscapes demonstrates that our method provides reliable safety guarantees while substantially tightening bounds compared to SOTA. We also provide a toolbox implementing this technique, available on Github.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks. Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

  Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for the early diagnosis of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in real-world clinical settings with limited computational resources. Although significant improvements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation methods, current models still face challenges in extracting tiny vessels and suffer from high computational costs. In this study, we present LFRA-Net by incorporating focal modulation attention at the encoder-decoder bottleneck and region-aware attention in the selective skip connections. LFRA-Net is a lightweight network optimized for precise and effective retinal vascular segmentation. It enhances feature representation and regional focus by efficiently capturing local and global dependencies. LFRA-Net outperformed many state-of-the-art models while maintaining lightweight characteristics with only 0.17 million parameters, 0.66 MB memory size, and 10.50 GFLOPs. We validated it on three publicly available datasets: DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB. It performed better in terms of Dice score (84.28\%, 88.44\%, and 85.50\%) and Jaccard index (72.86\%, 79.31\%, and 74.70\%) on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB datasets, respectively. LFRA-Net provides an ideal ratio between segmentation accuracy and computational cost compared to existing deep learning methods, which makes it suitable for real-time clinical applications in areas with limited resources.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computer-aided diagnosis systems must make critical decisions from medical images that are often noisy, ambiguous, or conflicting, yet today's models are trained on overly simplistic labels that ignore diagnostic uncertainty. One-hot labels erase inter-rater variability and force models to make overconfident predictions, especially when faced with incomplete or artifact-laden inputs. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework that brings uncertainty back into the label space. Our method leverages neural network training dynamics (NNTD) to assess the inherent difficulty of each training sample. By aggregating and calibrating model predictions during training, we generate uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels that reflect the ambiguity encountered during learning. This label augmentation approach is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any supervised learning pipeline to enhance uncertainty estimation and robustness. We validate our approach on a challenging echocardiography classification benchmark, demonstrating superior performance over specialized baselines in calibration, selective classification, and multi-view fusion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video Question Answering (VideoQA) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown potential in general video understanding but faces significant challenges when applied to the inherently complex domain of sports videos. In this work, we propose FineQuest, the first training-free framework that leverages dual-mode reasoning inspired by cognitive science: i) Reactive Reasoning for straightforward sports queries and ii) Deliberative Reasoning for more complex ones. To bridge the knowledge gap between general-purpose models and domain-specific sports understanding, FineQuest incorporates SSGraph, a multimodal sports knowledge scene graph spanning nine sports, which encodes both visual instances and domain-specific terminology to enhance reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce two new sports VideoQA benchmarks, Gym-QA and Diving-QA, derived from the FineGym and FineDiving datasets, enabling diverse and comprehensive evaluation. FineQuest achieves state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks as well as the existing SPORTU dataset, while maintains strong general VideoQA capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Retinal vessel segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and neurodegenerative disorders. Although SA-UNet introduces spatial attention in the bottleneck, it underuses attention in skip connections and does not address the severe foreground-background imbalance. We propose SA-UNetv2, a lightweight model that injects cross-scale spatial attention into all skip connections to strengthen multi-scale feature fusion and adopts a weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) plus Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) loss to improve robustness to class imbalance. On the public DRIVE and STARE datasets, SA-UNetv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1.2MB memory and 0.26M parameters (less than 50% of SA-UNet), and 1 second CPU inference on 592 x 592 x 3 images, demonstrating strong efficiency and deployability in resource-constrained, CPU-only settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

  _Danling Cao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing 3D face from a single unconstrained image remains a challenging problem due to diverse conditions in unconstrained environments. Recently, learning-based methods have achieved notable results by effectively capturing complex facial structures and details across varying conditions. Consequently, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model training. However, learning-based methods for 3D face reconstruction typically require substantial amounts of 3D facial data, which is difficult and costly to obtain. Consequently, to reduce reliance on labeled 3D face datasets, many existing approaches employ projection-based losses between generated and input images to constrain model training. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, existing approaches frequently struggle to capture detailed and multi-scale features under diverse facial attributes and conditions, leading to incomplete or less accurate reconstructions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Multi-Attribute (MSMA) framework for 3D face reconstruction from unconstrained images. Our method integrates multi-scale feature fusion with a focus on multi-attribute learning and leverages a large-kernel attention module to enhance the precision of feature extraction across scales, enabling accurate 3D facial parameter estimation from a single 2D image. Comprehensive experiments on the MICC Florence, Facewarehouse and custom-collect datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves results on par with current state-of-the-art methods, and in some instances, surpasses SOTA performance across challenging conditions.

  Artificial intelligence (AI) that can effectively learn ultrasound representations by integrating multi-source data holds significant promise for advancing clinical care. However, the scarcity of large labeled datasets in real-world clinical environments and the limited generalizability of task-specific models have hindered the development of generalizable clinical AI models for ultrasound applications. In this study, we present EchoCare, a novel ultrasound foundation model for generalist clinical use, developed via self-supervised learning on our curated, publicly available, large-scale dataset EchoCareData. EchoCareData comprises 4.5 million ultrasound images, sourced from over 23 countries across 5 continents and acquired via a diverse range of distinct imaging devices, thus encompassing global cohorts that are multi-center, multi-device, and multi-ethnic. Unlike prior studies that adopt off-the-shelf vision foundation model architectures, we introduce a hierarchical classifier into EchoCare to enable joint learning of pixel-level and representation-level features, capturing both global anatomical contexts and local ultrasound characteristics. With minimal training, EchoCare outperforms state-of-the-art comparison models across 10 representative ultrasound benchmarks of varying diagnostic difficulties, spanning disease diagnosis, lesion segmentation, organ detection, landmark prediction, quantitative regression, imaging enhancement and report generation. The code and pretrained model are publicly released, rendering EchoCare accessible for fine-tuning and local adaptation, supporting extensibility to additional applications. EchoCare provides a fully open and generalizable foundation model to boost the development of AI technologies for diverse clinical ultrasound applications.

  Trajectory data has become a key resource for automated map in-ference due to its low cost, broad coverage, and continuous availability. However, uneven trajectory density often leads to frag-mented roads in sparse areas and redundant segments in dense regions, posing significant challenges for existing methods. To address these issues, we propose DGMap, a dual-decoding framework with global context awareness, featuring Multi-scale Grid Encoding, Mask-enhanced Keypoint Extraction, and Global Context-aware Relation Prediction. By integrating global semantic context with local geometric features, DGMap improves keypoint detection accuracy to reduce road fragmentation in sparse-trajectory areas. Additionally, the Global Context-aware Relation Prediction module suppresses false connections in dense-trajectory regions by modeling long-range trajectory patterns. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DGMap outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5% in APLS, with notable performance gains on trajectory data from the Didi Chuxing platform

  Accurate segmentation of thin structures is critical for microsurgical scene understanding but remains challenging due to resolution loss, low contrast, and class imbalance. We propose Microsurgery Instrument Segmentation for Robotic Assistance(MISRA), a segmentation framework that augments RGB input with luminance channels, integrates skip attention to preserve elongated features, and employs an Iterative Feedback Module(IFM) for continuity restoration across multiple passes. In addition, we introduce a dedicated microsurgical dataset with fine-grained annotations of surgical instruments including thin objects, providing a benchmark for robust evaluation Dataset available atthis https URL. Experiments demonstrate that MISRA achieves competitive performance, improving the mean class IoU by 5.37% over competing methods, while delivering more stable predictions at instrument contacts and overlaps. These results position MISRA as a promising step toward reliable scene parsing for computer-assisted and robotic microsurgery.

  This technical report documents the development of novel Layout Analysis models integrated into the Docling document-conversion pipeline. We trained several state-of-the-art object detectors based on the RT-DETR, RT-DETRv2 and DFINE architectures on a heterogeneous corpus of 150,000 documents (both openly available and proprietary). Post-processing steps were applied to the raw detections to make them more applicable to the document conversion task. We evaluated the effectiveness of the layout analysis on various document benchmarks using different methodologies while also measuring the runtime performance across different environments (CPU, Nvidia and Apple GPUs). We introduce five new document layout models achieving 20.6% - 23.9% mAP improvement over Docling's previous baseline, with comparable or better runtime. Our best model, "heron-101", attains 78% mAP with 28 ms/image inference time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments establish best practices for training, evaluating, and deploying document-layout detectors, providing actionable guidance for the document conversion community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A recent study has proposed the "Master Key Filters Hypothesis" for convolutional neural network filters. This paper extends this hypothesis by radically constraining its scope to a single set of just 8 universal filters that depthwise separable convolutional networks inherently converge to. While conventional DS-CNNs employ thousands of distinct trained filters, our analysis reveals these filters are predom- inantly linear shifts (ax+b) of our discovered universal set. Through systematic unsupervised search, we extracted these fundamental patterns across different architectures and datasets. Remarkably, networks initialized with these 8 unique frozen filters achieve over 80% ImageNet accuracy, and even outperform models with thousands of trainable parameters when applied to smaller datasets. The identified master key filters closely match Difference of Gaussians (DoGs), Gaussians, and their derivatives, structures that are not only fundamental to classical image processing but also strikingly similar to receptive fields in mammalian visual systems. Our findings provide compelling evidence that depthwise convolutional layers naturally gravitate toward this fundamental set of spatial operators regardless of task or architecture. This work offers new insights for understanding generalization and transfer learning through the universal language of these master key filters.

  Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation, particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object 6DoF (6D) pose estimation is essential for robotic perception, especially in industrial settings. It enables robots to interact with the environment and manipulate objects. However, existing benchmarks on object 6D pose estimation primarily use everyday objects with rich textures and low-reflectivity, limiting model generalization to industrial scenarios where objects are often metallic, texture-less, and highly reflective. To address this gap, we propose a novel dataset and benchmark namely \textit{Industrial Metallic Dataset (IMD)}, tailored for industrial applications. Our dataset comprises 45 true-to-scale industrial components, captured with an RGB-D camera under natural indoor lighting and varied object arrangements to replicate real-world conditions. The benchmark supports three tasks, including video object segmentation, 6D pose tracking, and one-shot 6D pose estimation. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art models, including XMem and SAM2 for segmentation, and BundleTrack and BundleSDF for pose estimation, to assess model performance in industrial contexts. Evaluation results show that our industrial dataset is more challenging than existing household object datasets. This benchmark provides the baseline for developing and comparing segmentation and pose estimation algorithms that better generalize to industrial robotics scenarios.

  Intelligent tableware cleaning is a critical application in food safety and smart homes, but existing methods are limited by coarse-grained classification and scarcity of few-shot data, making it difficult to meet industrialization requirements. We propose DTGen, a few-shot data augmentation scheme based on generative diffusion models, specifically designed for fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. DTGen achieves efficient domain specialization through LoRA, generates diverse dirty images via structured prompts, and ensures data quality through CLIP-based cross-modal filtering. Under extremely limited real few-shot conditions, DTGen can synthesize virtually unlimited high-quality samples, significantly improving classifier performance and supporting fine-grained dirty tableware recognition. We further elaborate on lightweight deployment strategies, promising to transfer DTGen's benefits to embedded dishwashers and integrate with cleaning programs to intelligently regulate energy consumption and detergent usage. Research results demonstrate that DTGen not only validates the value of generative AI in few-shot industrial vision but also provides a feasible deployment path for automated tableware cleaning and food safety monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches, which aim to handle multiple weather degradations within a single framework, are predominantly trained and evaluated using mixed single-weather synthetic datasets. However, these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale, real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have shown promising results in free-form inpainting. Recent studies based on refined diffusion samplers or novel architectural designs led to realistic results and high data consistency. However, random initialization seed (noise) adopted in vanilla diffusion process may introduce mismatched semantic information in masked regions, leading to biased inpainting results, e.g., low consistency and low coherence with the other unmasked area. To address this issue, we propose the Initial Seed refined Diffusion Model (IS-Diff), a completely training-free approach incorporating distributional harmonious seeds to produce harmonious results. Specifically, IS-Diff employs initial seeds sampled from unmasked areas to imitate the masked data distribution, thereby setting a promising direction for the diffusion procedure. Moreover, a dynamic selective refinement mechanism is proposed to detect severe unharmonious inpaintings in intermediate latent and adjust the strength of our initialization prior dynamically. We validate our method on both standard and large-mask inpainting tasks using the CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, and Places2 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness across all metrics compared to state-of-the-art inpainting methods.

  We propose a novel 3D deepfake generation framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that enables realistic, identity-preserving face swapping and reenactment in a fully controllable 3D space. Compared to conventional 2D deepfake approaches that suffer from geometric inconsistencies and limited generalization to novel view, our method combines a parametric head model with dynamic Gaussian representations to support multi-view consistent rendering, precise expression control, and seamless background integration. To address editing challenges in point-based representations, we explicitly separate the head and background Gaussians and use pre-trained 2D guidance to optimize the facial region across views. We further introduce a repair module to enhance visual consistency under extreme poses and expressions. Experiments on NeRSemble and additional evaluation videos demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art 2D approaches in identity preservation, as well as pose and expression consistency, while significantly outperforming them in multi-view rendering quality and 3D consistency. Our approach bridges the gap between 3D modeling and deepfake synthesis, enabling new directions for scene-aware, controllable, and immersive visual forgeries, revealing the threat that emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting technique could be used for manipulation attacks.

  _Siming Fu, Sijun Dong, Xiaoliang Meng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection.

  With the rapid advancement of video generation models such as Sora, video quality assessment (VQA) is becoming increasingly crucial for selecting high-quality videos from large-scale datasets used in pre-training. Traditional VQA methods, typically producing single numerical scores, often lack comprehensiveness and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce MVQA-68K, a novel multi-dimensional VQA dataset comprising over 68,000 carefully annotated videos, covering seven essential quality dimensions: overall aesthetics, camera movement, dynamic degree, texture detail, composition, visual quality, and factual consistency. Each annotation includes detailed chain-of-thought reasoning to facilitate interpretability and comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVQA-68K significantly enhances the performance of various multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on the VQA task, achieving state-of-the-art results not only on our internal test set (Fig.1) but also on public benchmarks including LSVQ-test, LSVQ-1080p, and LIVE-VQC.

Unlike uniform distributions, BiCDO determines the optimal number of images per class to enhance reliability and minimize bias and variance in the objective function. BiCDO can be incorporated into existing training pipelines with minimal code changes and supports any labelled multi-class dataset. We have validated BiCDO using EfficientNet, ResNet and ConvNeXt on CIFAR-10 and iNaturalist21 datasets, demonstrating improved, balanced model performance through optimized data distribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to learn modality-invariant image features from unlabeled cross-modal person datasets by reducing the modality gap while minimizing reliance on costly manual annotations. Existing methods typically address USVI-ReID using cluster-based contrastive learning, which represents a person by a single cluster center. However, they primarily focus on the commonality of images within each cluster while neglecting the finer-grained differences among them. To address the limitation, we propose a Hierarchical Identity Learning (HIL) framework. Since each cluster may contain several smaller sub-clusters that reflect fine-grained variations among images, we generate multiple memories for each existing coarse-grained cluster via a secondary clustering. Additionally, we propose Multi-Center Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to refine representations for enhancing intra-modal clustering and minimizing cross-modal discrepancies. To further improve cross-modal matching quality, we design a Bidirectional Reverse Selection Transmission (BRST) mechanism, which establishes reliable cross-modal correspondences by performing bidirectional matching of pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  _Zhexi Peng, Kun Zhou, Tianjia Shao_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  While recent Gaussian-based SLAM methods achieve photorealistic reconstruction from RGB-D data, their computational performance remains a critical bottleneck. State-of-the-art techniques operate at less than 20 fps, significantly lagging behind geometry-centric approaches like KinectFusion (hundreds of fps). This limitation stems from the heavy computational burden: modeling scenes requires numerous Gaussians and complex iterative optimization to fit RGB-D data, where insufficient Gaussian counts or optimization iterations cause severe quality degradation. To address this, we propose a Gaussian-SDF hybrid representation, combining a colorized Signed Distance Field (SDF) for smooth geometry and appearance with 3D Gaussians to capture underrepresented details. The SDF is efficiently constructed via RGB-D fusion (as in geometry-centric methods), while Gaussians undergo iterative optimization. Our representation enables drastic Gaussian reduction (50% fewer) by avoiding full-scene Gaussian modeling, and efficient Gaussian optimization (75% fewer iterations) through targeted appearance refinement. Building upon this representation, we develop GPS-SLAM (Gaussian-Plus-SDF SLAM), a real-time 3D reconstruction system achieving over 150 fps on real-world Azure Kinect sequences -- delivering an order-of-magnitude speedup over state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality. We will release the source code and data to facilitate future research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a fundamental task for building GUI agents. However, general vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with this task due to a lack of specific optimization. We identify a key gap in this paper: while VLMs exhibit significant latent grounding potential, as demonstrated by their performance measured by Pointing Game, they underperform when tasked with outputting explicit coordinates. To address this discrepancy, and bypass the high data and annotation costs of current fine-tuning approaches, we propose three zero-shot auxiliary reasoning methods. By providing explicit spatial cues such as axes, grids and labeled intersections as part of the input image, these methods enable VLMs to articulate their implicit spatial understanding capabilities. We evaluate these methods on four GUI grounding benchmarks across seven open-source and proprietary VLMs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve the performance of GUI grounding.

  Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment objects that blend into their surroundings. However, most existing studies overlook the semantic differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries. In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

  Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is a fundamental task in multi-modal perception that aims to integrate complementary structural and textural cues from different spectral domains. In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks such as object detection and scene understanding.

  LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers. Video is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Missing input sequences are common in medical imaging data, posing a challenge for deep learning models reliant on complete input data. In this work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information (multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing input sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the strength of this pretraining strategy. The implementation is made available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Identifying new disease-related patterns in medical imaging data with the help of machine learning enlarges the vocabulary of rec- ognizable findings. This supports diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, image appearance varies not only due to biological differences, but also due to imaging technology linked to vendors, scanning- or re- construction parameters. The resulting domain shifts impedes data rep- resentation learning strategies and the discovery of biologically mean- ingful cluster appearances. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach to actively learn the domain shift via post-hoc rotation of the data latent space, enabling disentanglement of biological and tech- nical factors. Results on real-world heterogeneous clinical data show- case that the learned disentangled representation leads to stable clus- ters representing tissue-types across different acquisition settings. Clus- ter consistency is improved by +19.01% (ARI), +16.85% (NMI), and +12.39% (Dice) compared to the entangled representation, outperform- ing four state-of-the-art harmonization methods. When using the clus- ters to quantify tissue composition on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis pa- tients, the learned profiles enhance Cox survival prediction. This indi- cates that the proposed label-free framework facilitates biomarker dis- covery in multi-center routine imaging data. Code is available on GitHubthis https URL.

  In real world clinical environments, training and applying deep learning models on multi-modal medical imaging data often struggles with partially incomplete data. Standard approaches either discard missing samples, require imputation or repurpose dropout learning schemes, limiting robustness and generalizability. To address this, we propose a hypernetwork-based method that dynamically generates task-specific classification models conditioned on the set of available modalities. Instead of training a fixed model, a hypernetwork learns to predict the parameters of a task model adapted to available modalities, enabling training and inference on all samples, regardless of completeness. We compare this approach with (1) models trained only on complete data, (2) state of the art channel dropout methods, and (3) an imputation-based method, using artificially incomplete datasets to systematically analyze robustness to missing modalities. Results demonstrate superior adaptability of our method, outperforming state of the art approaches with an absolute increase in accuracy of up to 8% when trained on a dataset with 25% completeness (75% of training data with missing modalities). By enabling a single model to generalize across all modality configurations, our approach provides an efficient solution for real-world multi-modal medical data analysis.

  We present MixANT, a novel architecture for stochastic long-term dense anticipation of human activities. While recent State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba have shown promise through input-dependent selectivity on three key parameters, the critical forget-gate ($\textbf{A}$ matrix) controlling temporal memory remains static. We address this limitation by introducing a mixture of experts approach that dynamically selects contextually relevant $\textbf{A}$ matrices based on input features, enhancing representational capacity without sacrificing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101 datasets demonstrate that MixANT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation settings. Our results highlight the importance of input-dependent forget-gate mechanisms for reliable prediction of human behavior in diverse real-world scenarios.

  Three-dimensional (3-D) skin surface reconstruction offers promise for objective and quantitative dermatological assessment, but no portable, high-resolution device exists that has been validated and used for depth reconstruction across various body locations. We present a compact 3-D skin reconstruction probe based on GelSight tactile imaging with a custom elastic gel and a learning-based reconstruction algorithm for micron-level wrinkle height estimation. Our probe, integrated into a handheld probe with force sensing for consistent contact, achieves a mean absolute error of 12.55 micron on wrinkle-like test objects. In a study with 15 participants without skin disorders, we provide the first validated wrinkle depth metrics across multiple body regions. We further demonstrate statistically significant reductions in wrinkle height at three locations following over-the-counter moisturizer application. Our work offers a validated tool for clinical and cosmetic skin analysis, with potential applications in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and skincare efficacy evaluation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Video detailed captioning aims to generate comprehensive video descriptions to facilitate video understanding. Recently, most efforts in the video detailed captioning community have been made towards a local-to-global paradigm, which first generates local captions from video clips and then summarizes them into a global caption. However, we find this paradigm leads to less detailed and contextual-inconsistent captions, which can be attributed to (1) no mechanism to ensure fine-grained captions, and (2) weak interaction between local and global captions. To remedy the above two issues, we propose GLaVE-Cap, a Global-Local aligned framework with Vision Expert integration for Captioning, which consists of two core modules: TrackFusion enables comprehensive local caption generation, by leveraging vision experts to acquire cross-frame visual prompts, coupled with a dual-stream structure; while CaptionBridge establishes a local-global interaction, by using global context to guide local captioning, and adaptively summarizing local captions into a coherent global caption. Besides, we construct GLaVE-Bench, a comprehensive video captioning benchmark featuring 5X more queries per video than existing benchmarks, covering diverse visual dimensions to facilitate reliable evaluation. We further provide a training dataset GLaVE-1.2M containing 16K high-quality fine-grained video captions and 1.2M related question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks show that our GLaVE-Cap achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the ablation studies and student model analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and the contribution of GLaVE-1.2M to the video understanding community. The source code, model weights, benchmark, and dataset will be open-sourced.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image classification but remain vulnerable to common corruptions that humans handle with ease. A key reason for this fragility is their reliance on local texture cues rather than global object shapes -- a stark contrast to human perception. To address this, we propose two complementary regularization strategies designed to encourage shape-biased representations and enhance robustness. The first introduces an auxiliary loss that enforces feature consistency between original and low-frequency filtered inputs, discouraging dependence on high-frequency textures. The second incorporates supervised contrastive learning to structure the feature space around class-consistent, shape-relevant representations. Evaluated on the CIFAR-10-C benchmark, both methods improve corruption robustness without degrading clean accuracy. Our results suggest that loss-level regularization can effectively steer CNNs toward more shape-aware, resilient representations.

  Self-supervised learning (SSL) conventionally relies on the instance consistency paradigm, assuming that different views of the same image can be treated as positive pairs. However, this assumption breaks down for non-iconic data, where different views may contain distinct objects or semantic information. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SSL when instance consistency is not guaranteed. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that SSL can still learn meaningful representations even when positive pairs lack strict instance consistency. Furthermore, our analysis further reveals that increasing view diversity, by enforcing zero overlapping or using smaller crop scales, can enhance downstream performance on classification and dense prediction tasks. However, excessive diversity is found to reduce effectiveness, suggesting an optimal range for view diversity. To quantify this, we adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as an estimator to measure mutual information between views, finding that moderate EMD values correlate with improved SSL learning, providing insights for future SSL framework design. We validate our findings across a range of settings, highlighting their robustness and applicability on diverse data sources.

  Long-wave infrared radiation captured by a thermal camera consists of two components: (a) light from the environment reflected or transmitted by a surface, and (b) light emitted by the surface after undergoing heat transport through the object and exchanging heat with the surrounding environment. Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Medical Image Computing (MIC) is a broad research topic covering both pixel-wise (e.g., segmentation, registration) and image-wise (e.g., classification, regression) vision tasks. Effective analysis demands models that capture both global long-range context and local subtle visual characteristics, necessitating fine-grained long-range visual dependency modeling. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are limited by intrinsic locality, transformers excel at long-range modeling; however, due to the high computational loads of self-attention, transformers typically cannot process high-resolution features (e.g., full-scale image features before downsampling or patch embedding) and thus face difficulties in modeling fine-grained dependency among subtle medical image details. Concurrently, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)-based visual models are recognized as computation/memory-efficient alternatives in modeling long-range visual dependency but have yet to be widely investigated in the MIC community. This doctoral research advances deep learning-based MIC by investigating effective long-range visual dependency modeling. It first presents innovative use of transformers for both pixel- and image-wise medical vision tasks. The focus then shifts to MLPs, pioneeringly developing MLP-based visual models to capture fine-grained long-range visual dependency in medical images. Extensive experiments confirm the critical role of long-range dependency modeling in MIC and reveal a key finding: MLPs provide feasibility in modeling finer-grained long-range dependency among higher-resolution medical features containing enriched anatomical/pathological details. This finding establishes MLPs as a superior paradigm over transformers/CNNs, consistently enhancing performance across various medical vision tasks and paving the way for next-generation medical vision backbones.

  Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT).It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches.The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT.However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary.In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT.In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps.First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information.Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements.To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.The code is available at (this https URLandthis https URL).

  We propose UnLoc, an efficient data-driven solution for sequential camera localization within floorplans. Floorplan data is readily available, long-term persistent, and robust to changes in visual appearance. We address key limitations of recent methods, such as the lack of uncertainty modeling in depth predictions and the necessity for custom depth networks trained for each environment. We introduce a novel probabilistic model that incorporates uncertainty estimation, modeling depth predictions as explicit probability distributions. By leveraging off-the-shelf pre-trained monocular depth models, we eliminate the need to rely on per-environment-trained depth networks, enhancing generalization to unseen spaces. We evaluate UnLoc on large-scale synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Notably, we achieve $2.7$ times higher localization recall on long sequences (100 frames) and $16.7$ times higher on short ones (15 frames) than the state of the art on the challenging LaMAR HGE dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unaligned Scene Change Detection aims to detect scene changes between image pairs captured at different times without assuming viewpoint alignment. To handle viewpoint variations, current methods rely solely on 2D visual cues to establish cross-image correspondence to assist change detection. However, large viewpoint changes can alter visual observations, causing appearance-based matching to drift or fail. Additionally, supervision limited to 2D change masks from small-scale SCD datasets restricts the learning of generalizable multi-view knowledge, making it difficult to reliably identify visual overlaps and handle occlusions. This lack of explicit geometric reasoning represents a critical yet overlooked limitation. In this work, we are the first to leverage geometric priors from a Geometric Foundation Model to address the core challenges of unaligned SCD, including reliable identification of visual overlaps, robust correspondence establishment, and explicit occlusion detection. Building on these priors, we propose a training-free framework that integrates them with the powerful representations of a visual foundation model to enable reliable change detection under viewpoint misalignment. Through extensive evaluation on the PSCD, ChangeSim, and PASLCD datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior and robust performance. Our code will be released atthis https URL.

  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from serious hallucination problems, where the model-generated responses are inconsistent with the visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are mainly based on preference alignment and require external human annotations or auxiliary models for preference data collection, which increase costs and limit sustainable improvement. To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference Alignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that mitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the target LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a pair of responses with varying preference levels. During the self-injection process, the dis-preferred response is generated based on three key observations of hallucinations, ensuring it simulates real hallucination patterns. This fidelity offers an accurate learning signal for hallucination mitigation. Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training strategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the preference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous enhancement of the LVLM. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show that APASI not only effectively mitigates hallucinations for three baseline models but also achieves comparable or even superior performance to alignment-based methods with external dependency, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image data captured outdoors often exhibit unbounded scenes and unconstrained, varying lighting conditions, making it challenging to decompose them into geometry, reflectance, and illumination. Recent works have focused on achieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key limitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of NeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result in inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS, a two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor scenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular normal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and accurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS then decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting model. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing a spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency components of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via Spherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight comprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting outdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency.

  With the rapid advancement of synthetic dataset generation techniques, evaluating the quality of synthetic data has become a critical research focus. Robust evaluation not only drives innovations in data generation methods but also guides researchers in optimizing the utilization of these synthetic resources. However, current evaluation studies for synthetic datasets remain limited, lacking a universally accepted standard framework. To address this, this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework integrating generalized cross-validation experiments and domain transfer learning principles, enabling generalizable and comparable assessments of synthetic dataset quality. The framework involves training task-specific models (e.g., YOLOv5s) on both synthetic datasets and multiple real-world benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, BDD100K), forming a cross-performance matrix. Following normalization, a Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) Matrix is constructed to quantify domain transferability. The framework introduces two key metrics. One measures the simulation quality by quantifying the similarity between synthetic data and real-world datasets, while another evaluates the transfer quality by assessing the diversity and coverage of synthetic data across various real-world scenarios. Experimental validation on Virtual KITTI demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework and metrics in assessing synthetic data fidelity. This scalable and quantifiable evaluation solution overcomes traditional limitations, providing a principled approach to guide synthetic dataset optimization in artificial intelligence research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

  Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth (SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection (AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss. Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of sequential learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents MIS-LSTM, a hybrid framework that joins CNN encoders with an LSTM sequence model for sleep quality and stress prediction at the day level from multimodal lifelog data. Continuous sensor streams are first partitioned into N-hour blocks and rendered as multi-channel images, while sparse discrete events are encoded with a dedicated 1D-CNN. A Convolutional Block Attention Module fuses the two modalities into refined block embeddings, which an LSTM then aggregates to capture long-range temporal dependencies. To further boost robustness, we introduce UALRE, an uncertainty-aware ensemble that overrides lowconfidence majority votes with high-confidence individual predictions. Experiments on the 2025 ETRI Lifelog Challenge dataset show that Our base MISLSTM achieves Macro-F1 0.615; with the UALRE ensemble, the score improves to 0.647, outperforming strong LSTM, 1D-CNN, and CNN baselines. Ablations confirm (i) the superiority of multi-channel over stacked-vertical imaging, (ii) the benefit of a 4-hour block granularity, and (iii) the efficacy of modality-specific discrete encoding.

  Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which involves learning to generalize using only a few data samples, has demonstrated promising and superior performances to ordinary CNN methods. While Bayesian based estimation approaches using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence have shown improvements, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks and natural noises. We introduce ANROT-HELANet, an Adversarially and Naturally RObusT Hellinger Aggregation Network that significantly advances the state-of-the-art in FSL robustness and performance. Our approach implements an adversarially and naturally robust Hellinger distance-based feature class aggregation scheme, demonstrating resilience to adversarial perturbations up to $\epsilon=0.30$ and Gaussian noise up to $\sigma=0.30$. The network achieves substantial improvements across benchmark datasets, including gains of 1.20\% and 1.40\% for 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios on miniImageNet respectively. We introduce a novel Hellinger Similarity contrastive loss function that generalizes cosine similarity contrastive loss for variational few-shot inference scenarios. Our approach also achieves superior image reconstruction quality with a FID score of 2.75, outperforming traditional VAE (3.43) and WAE (3.38) approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on four few-shot benchmarked datasets verify that ANROT-HELANet's combination of Hellinger distance-based feature aggregation, attention mechanisms, and our novel loss function establishes new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness against both adversarial and natural perturbations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cattle identification is critical for efficient livestock farming management, currently reliant on radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tags. However, RFID-based systems are prone to failure due to loss, damage, tampering, and vulnerability to external attacks. As a robust alternative, biometric identification using cattle muzzle patterns similar to human fingerprints has emerged as a promising solution. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated success in leveraging these unique patterns for accurate identification. But deep learning models face significant challenges, including limited data availability, disruptions during data collection, and dynamic herd compositions that require frequent model retraining. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel few-shot learning framework for real-time cattle identification using Cooperative Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (CCoMAML) with Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) as a feature extractor model. This model offers great model adaptability to new data through efficient learning from few data samples without retraining. The proposed approach has been rigorously evaluated against current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques applied in cattle identification. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CCoMAML with MHAFF has superior cattle identification performance with 98.46% and 97.91% F1 scores.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) remains highly sensitive to geometric variability, where objects appear under arbitrary orientations, scales, and perspective distortions. While equivariant architectures address this issue, they typically require substantial computational resources and restrict the hypothesis space. We revisit Spatial Transformer Networks (STNs) as a canonicalization tool for transformer-based vision pipelines, emphasizing their flexibility, backbone-agnostic nature, and lack of architectural constraints. We propose a probabilistic, component-wise extension that improves robustness. Specifically, we decompose affine transformations into rotation, scaling, and shearing, and regress each component under geometric constraints using a shared localization encoder. To capture uncertainty, we model each component with a Gaussian variational posterior and perform sampling-based canonicalization during inference.A novel component-wise alignment loss leverages augmentation parameters to guide spatial alignment. Experiments on challenging moth classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently improves robustness compared to other STNs.

  In the realm of image generation, the quest for realism and customization has never been more pressing. While existing methods like concept sliders have made strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories. Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a marked enhancement in image quality and realism. Extensive experimental validation confirms the robustness and versatility of Beyond Sliders across a spectrum of applications.

  Accurate tree segmentation is a key step in extracting individual tree metrics from forest laser scans, and is essential to understanding ecosystem functions in carbon cycling and beyond. Over the past decade, tree segmentation algorithms have advanced rapidly due to developments in AI. However existing, public, 3D forest datasets are not large enough to build robust tree segmentation systems. Motivated by the success of synthetic data in other domains such as self-driving, we investigate whether similar approaches can help with tree segmentation. In place of expensive field data collection and annotation, we use synthetic data during pretraining, and then require only minimal, real forest plot annotation for fine-tuning.We have developed a new synthetic data generation pipeline to do this for forest vision tasks, integrating advances in game-engines with physics-based LiDAR simulation. As a result, we have produced a comprehensive, diverse, annotated 3D forest dataset on an unprecedented scale. Extensive experiments with a state-of-the-art tree segmentation algorithm and a popular real dataset show that our synthetic data can substantially reduce the need for labelled real data. After fine-tuning on just a single, real, forest plot of less than 0.1 hectare, the pretrained model achieves segmentations that are competitive with a model trained on the full scale real data. We have also identified critical factors for successful use of synthetic data: physics, diversity, and scale, paving the way for more robust 3D forest vision systems in the future. Our data generation pipeline and the resulting dataset are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically classify skin lesions from dermatology images have shown promising performance but also susceptibility to bias by skin tone. The most common way of representing skin tone information is the Fitzpatrick Skin Tone (FST) scale. The FST scale has been criticised for having greater granularity in its skin tone categories for lighter-skinned subjects. This paper conducts an investigation of the impact (on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST scale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions using FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when training models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and 5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data compared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the granularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a detrimental effect on performance. Our results highlight the importance of the granularity of FST groups when training lesion classification models. Given the question marks over possible human biases in the choice of categories in the FST scale, this paper provides evidence for a move away from the FST scale in fair AI research and a transition to an alternative scale that better represents the diversity of human skin tones.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of both the stego and recovery images.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camera-based 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a critical task in autonomous driving systems, assessing voxel-level geometry and semantics for holistic scene perception. While existing voxel-based and plane-based SSC methods have achieved considerable progress, they struggle to capture physical regularities for realistic geometric details. On the other hand, neural reconstruction methods like NeRF and 3DGS demonstrate superior physical awareness, but suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence when handling large-scale, complex autonomous driving scenes, leading to inferior semantic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-PHysical Engaged REpresentation (SPHERE) for camera-based SSC, which integrates voxel and Gaussian representations for joint exploitation of semantic and physical information. First, the Semantic-guided Gaussian Initialization (SGI) module leverages dual-branch 3D scene representations to locate focal voxels as anchors to guide efficient Gaussian initialization. Then, the Physical-aware Harmonics Enhancement (PHE) module incorporates semantic spherical harmonics to model physical-aware contextual details and promote semantic-geometry consistency through focal distribution alignment, generating SSC results with realistic details. Extensive experiments and analyses on the popular SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SPHERE. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D reconstruction technology generates three-dimensional representations of real-world objects, scenes, or environments using sensor data such as 2D images, with extensive applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality systems. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques based on 2D images typically relies on RGB spectral information. With advances in sensor technology, additional spectral bands beyond RGB have been increasingly incorporated into 3D reconstruction workflows. Existing methods that integrate these expanded spectral data often suffer from expensive scheme prices, low accuracy and poor geometric features. Three - dimensional reconstruction based on NeRF can effectively address the various issues in current multispectral 3D reconstruction methods, producing high - precision and high - quality reconstruction results. However, currently, NeRF and some improved models such as NeRFacto are trained on three - band data and cannot take into account the multi - band information. To address this problem, we propose Multispectral-NeRF, an enhanced neural architecture derived from NeRF that can effectively integrates multispectral information. Our technical contributions comprise threefold modifications: Expanding hidden layer dimensionality to accommodate 6-band spectral inputs; Redesigning residual functions to optimize spectral discrepancy calculations between reconstructed and reference images; Adapting data compression modules to address the increased bit-depth requirements of multispectral imagery. Experimental results confirm that Multispectral-NeRF successfully processes multi-band spectral features while accurately preserving the original scenes' spectral characteristics.

  As intelligent transportation systems advance, traffic video understanding plays an increasingly pivotal role in comprehensive scene perception and causal analysis. Yet, existing approaches face notable challenges in accurately modeling spatiotemporal causality and integrating domain-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Traffic-MLLM, a multimodal large language model tailored for fine-grained traffic analysis. Built on the Qwen2.5-VL backbone, our model leverages high-quality traffic-specific multimodal datasets and uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly enhancing its capacity to model continuous spatiotemporal features in video sequences. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative knowledge prompting module fusing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling precise injection of detailed traffic regulations and domain knowledge into the inference process. This design markedly boosts the model's logical reasoning and knowledge adaptation capabilities. Experimental results on TrafficQA and DriveQA benchmarks show Traffic-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its superior ability to process multimodal traffic data. It also exhibits remarkable zero-shot reasoning and cross-scenario generalization capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective reef monitoring requires the quantification of coral growth via accurate volumetric and surface area estimates, which is a challenging task due to the complex morphology of corals. We propose a novel, lightweight, and scalable learning framework that addresses this challenge by predicting the 3D volume and surface area of coral-like objects from 2D multi-view RGB images. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained module (VGGT) to extract dense point maps from each view; these maps are merged into a unified point cloud and enriched with per-view confidence scores. The resulting cloud is fed to two parallel DGCNN decoder heads, which jointly output the volume and the surface area of the coral, as well as their corresponding confidence estimate. To enhance prediction stability and provide uncertainty estimates, we introduce a composite loss function based on Gaussian negative log-likelihood in both real and log domains. Our method achieves competitive accuracy and generalizes well to unseen morphologies. This framework paves the way for efficient and scalable coral geometry estimation directly from a sparse set of images, with potential applications in coral growth analysis and reef monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, high-quality novel view synthesis but typically relies on densification followed by pruning to optimize the number of Gaussians. Existing mask-based pruning, such as MaskGS, regularizes the global mean of the mask, which is misaligned with the local per-pixel (per-ray) reconstruction loss that determines image quality along individual camera rays. This paper introduces SVR-GS, a spatially variant regularizer that renders a per-pixel spatial mask from each Gaussian's effective contribution along the ray, thereby applying sparsity pressure where it matters: on low-importance Gaussians. We explore three spatial-mask aggregation strategies, implement them in CUDA, and conduct a gradient analysis to motivate our final design. Extensive experiments on Tanks\&Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that, on average across the three datasets, the proposed SVR-GS reduces the number of Gaussians by 1.79\(\times\) compared to MaskGS and 5.63\(\times\) compared to 3DGS, while incurring only 0.50 dB and 0.40 dB PSNR drops, respectively. These gains translate into significantly smaller, faster, and more memory-efficient models, making them well-suited for real-time applications such as robotics, AR/VR, and mobile perception.

  We propose a pipeline to extract and reconstruct dynamic 3D smoke assets from a single in-the-wild video, and further integrate interactive simulation for smoke design and editing. Recent developments in 3D vision have significantly improved reconstructing and rendering fluid dynamics, supporting realistic and temporally consistent view synthesis. However, current fluid reconstructions rely heavily on carefully controlled clean lab environments, whereas real-world videos captured in the wild are largely underexplored. We pinpoint three key challenges of reconstructing smoke in real-world videos and design targeted techniques, including smoke extraction with background removal, initialization of smoke particles and camera poses, and inferring multi-view videos. Our method not only outperforms previous reconstruction and generation methods with high-quality smoke reconstructions (+2.22 average PSNR on wild videos), but also enables diverse and realistic editing of fluid dynamics by simulating our smoke assets. We provide our models, data, and 4D smoke assets at [this https URL](this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal learning has shown significant performance boost compared to ordinary unimodal models across various domains. However, in real-world scenarios, multimodal signals are susceptible to missing because of sensor failures and adverse weather conditions, which drastically deteriorates models' operation and performance. Generative models such as AutoEncoder (AE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are intuitive solutions aiming to reconstruct missing modality from available ones. Yet, their efficacy in remote sensing semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we first examine the limitations of existing generative approaches in handling the heterogeneity of multimodal remote sensing data. They inadequately capture semantic context in complex scenes with large intra-class and small inter-class variation. In addition, traditional generative models are susceptible to heavy dependence on the dominant modality, introducing bias that affects model robustness under missing modality conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Enhanced MultiModal learning Network (GEMMNet) with three key components: (1) Hybrid Feature Extractor (HyFEx) to effectively learn modality-specific representations, (2) Hybrid Fusion with Multiscale Awareness (HyFMA) to capture modality-synergistic semantic context across scales and (3) Complementary Loss (CoLoss) scheme to alleviate the inherent bias by encouraging consistency across modalities and tasks. Our method, GEMMNet, outperforms both generative baselines AE, cGAN (conditional GAN), and state-of-the-art non-generative approaches - mmformer and shaspec - on two challenging semantic segmentation remote sensing datasets (Vaihingen and Potsdam).

  Timely assessment of structural damage is critical for disaster response and recovery. However, most prior work in natural disaster analysis relies on 2D imagery, which lacks depth, suffers from occlusions, and provides limited spatial context. 3D semantic segmentation offers a richer alternative, but existing 3D benchmarks focus mainly on urban or indoor scenes, with little attention to disaster-affected areas. To address this gap, we present 3DAeroRelief--the first 3D benchmark dataset specifically designed for post-disaster assessment. Collected using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over hurricane-damaged regions, the dataset features dense 3D point clouds reconstructed via Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View Stereo techniques. Semantic annotations were produced through manual 2D labeling and projected into 3D space. Unlike existing datasets, 3DAeroRelief captures 3D large-scale outdoor environments with fine-grained structural damage in real-world disaster contexts. UAVs enable affordable, flexible, and safe data collection in hazardous areas, making them particularly well-suited for emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of 3DAeroRelief, we evaluate several state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on the dataset to highlight both the challenges and opportunities of 3D scene understanding in disaster response. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing robust 3D vision systems in real-world applications for post-disaster scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) aims to model variable endmembers and dynamical abundances, which emphasizes the critical temporal information. However, existing methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependency, thus fail to capture the dynamical material evolution. Motivated by the ability of copula theory in modeling dependency structure explicitly, in this paper, we propose a copula-guided temporal dependency method (Cog-TD) for multitemporal hyperspectral unmixing. Cog-TD defines new mathematical model, constructs copula-guided framework and provides two key modules with theoretical support. The mathematical model provides explicit formulations for MTHU problem definition, which describes temporal dependency structure by incorporating copula theory. The copula-guided framework is constructed for utilizing copula function, which estimates dynamical endmembers and abundances with temporal dependency. The key modules consist of copula function estimation and temporal dependency guidance, which computes and employs temporal information to guide unmixing process. Moreover, the theoretical support demonstrates that estimated copula function is valid and the represented temporal dependency exists in hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this paper include redefining MTHU problem with temporal dependency, proposing a copula-guided framework, developing two key modules and providing theoretical support. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.

  The performance of hyperspectral unmixing may be constrained by low spatial resolution, which can be enhanced using super-resolution in a multitask learning way. However, integrating super-resolution and unmixing directly may suffer two challenges: Task affinity is not verified, and the convergence of unmixing is not guaranteed. To address the above issues, in this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and propose super-resolution guided multi-task learning method for hyperspectral unmixing (SMILE). The provided theoretical analysis validates feasibility of multitask learning way and verifies task affinity, which consists of relationship and existence theorems by proving the positive guidance of super-resolution. The proposed framework generalizes positive information from super-resolution to unmixing by learning both shared and specific representations. Moreover, to guarantee the convergence, we provide the accessibility theorem by proving the optimal solution of unmixing. The major contributions of SMILE include providing progressive theoretical support, and designing a new framework for unmixing under the guidance of super-resolution. Our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have substantiate the usefulness of our work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Generating high-quality 360¬∞ panoramic videos remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between panoramic and traditional perspective-view projections. While perspective videos rely on a single viewpoint with a limited field of view, panoramic content requires rendering the full surrounding environment, making it difficult for standard video generation models to adapt. Existing solutions often introduce complex architectures or large-scale training, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results. Motivated by the success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in style transfer tasks, we propose treating panoramic video generation as an adaptation problem from perspective views. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that LoRA can effectively model the transformation between these projections when its rank exceeds the degrees of freedom in the task. Our approach efficiently fine-tunes a pretrained video diffusion model using only approximately 1,000 videos while achieving high-quality panoramic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains proper projection geometry and surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, left-right consistency, and motion diversity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Precise parking requires an end-to-end system where perception adaptively provides policy-relevant details-especially in critical areas where fine control decisions are essential. End-to-end learning offers a unified framework by directly mapping sensor inputs to control actions, but existing approaches lack effective synergy between perception and control. We find that transformer-based self-attention, when used alone, tends to produce unstable and temporally inconsistent spatial attention, which undermines the reliability of downstream policy decisions over time. Instead, we propose CAA-Policy, an end-to-end imitation learning system that allows control signal to guide the learning of visual attention via a novel Control-Aided Attention (CAA) mechanism. For the first time, we train such an attention module in a self-supervised manner, using backpropagated gradients from the control outputs instead of from the training loss. This strategy encourages the attention to focus on visual features that induce high variance in action outputs, rather than merely minimizing the training loss-a shift we demonstrate leads to a more robust and generalizable policy. To further enhance stability, CAA-Policy integrates short-horizon waypoint prediction as an auxiliary task, and introduces a separately trained motion prediction module to robustly track the target spot over time. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator show that \titlevariable~consistently surpasses both the end-to-end learning baseline and the modular BEV segmentation + hybrid A* pipeline, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

  We present a robust multi-modal framework for predicting traversability costmaps for planetary rovers. Our model fuses camera and LiDAR data to produce a bird's-eye-view (BEV) terrain costmap, trained self-supervised using IMU-derived labels. Key updates include a DINOv3-based image encoder, FiLM-based sensor fusion, and an optimization loss combining Huber and smoothness terms. Experimental ablations (removing image color, occluding inputs, adding noise) show only minor changes in MAE/MSE (e.g. MAE increases from ~0.0775 to 0.0915 when LiDAR is sparsified), indicating that geometry dominates the learned cost and the model is highly robust. We attribute the small performance differences to the IMU labeling primarily reflecting terrain geometry rather than semantics and to limited data diversity. Unlike prior work claiming large gains, we emphasize our contributions: (1) a high-fidelity, reproducible simulation environment; (2) a self-supervised IMU-based labeling pipeline; and (3) a strong multi-modal BEV costmap prediction model. We discuss limitations and future work such as domain generalization and dataset expansion.

  Recent advances in organoid models have revolutionized the study of human kidney disease mechanisms and drug discovery by enabling scalable, cost-effective research without the need for animal sacrifice. Here, we present a kidney organoid platform optimized for efficient screening in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While these systems generate rich spatial-temporal microscopy video datasets, current manual approaches to analysis remain limited to coarse classifications (e.g., hit vs. non-hit), often missing valuable pixel-level and longitudinal information. To help overcome this bottleneck, we developed Organoid Tracker, a graphical user interface (GUI) platform designed with a modular plugin architecture, which empowers researchers to extract detailed, quantitative metrics without programming expertise.

- **[Action Hints: Semantic Typicality and Context Uniqueness for Generalizable Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11058)**  `arXiv:2509.11058`  
  _Canhui Tang, Sanping Zhou, Haoyue Shi, Le Wang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-Shot Video Anomaly Detection (ZS-VAD) requires temporally localizing anomalies without target domain training data, which is a crucial task due to various practical concerns, e.g., data privacy or new surveillance deployments. Skeleton-based approach has inherent generalizable advantages in achieving ZS-VAD as it eliminates domain disparities both in background and human appearance. However, existing methods only learn low-level skeleton representation and rely on the domain-limited normality boundary, which cannot generalize well to new scenes with different normal and abnormal behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot video anomaly detection framework, unlocking the potential of skeleton data via action typicality and uniqueness learning. Firstly, we introduce a language-guided semantic typicality modeling module that projects skeleton snippets into action semantic space and distills LLM's knowledge of typical normal and abnormal behaviors during training. Secondly, we propose a test-time context uniqueness analysis module to finely analyze the spatio-temporal differences between skeleton snippets and then derive scene-adaptive boundaries. Without using any training samples from the target domain, our method achieves state-of-the-art results against skeleton-based methods on four large-scale VAD datasets: ShanghaiTech, UBnormal, NWPU, and UCF-Crime, featuring over 100 unseen surveillance scenes.

  Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).

  The FungiCLEF 2025 competition addresses the challenge of automatic fungal species recognition using realistic, field-collected observational data. Accurate identification tools support both mycologists and citizen scientists, greatly enhancing large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Effective recognition systems in this context must handle highly imbalanced class distributions and provide reliable performance even when very few training samples are available for many species, especially rare and under-documented taxa that are often missing from standard training sets. According to competition organizers, about 20\% of all verified fungi observations, representing nearly 20,000 instances, are associated with these rarely recorded species. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust deep learning method based on prototypical networks, which enhances prototype representations for few-shot fungal classification. Our prototypical network approach exceeds the competition baseline by more than 30 percentage points in Recall@5 on both the public (PB) and private (PR) leaderboards. This demonstrates strong potential for accurately identifying both common and rare fungal species, supporting the main objectives of FungiCLEF 2025.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Animal health monitoring and population management are critical aspects of wildlife conservation and livestock management that increasingly rely on automated detection and tracking systems. While Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based systems combined with computer vision offer promising solutions for non-invasive animal monitoring across challenging terrains, limited availability of labeled training data remains an obstacle in developing effective deep learning (DL) models for these applications. Transfer learning has emerged as a potential solution, allowing models trained on large datasets to be adapted for resource-limited scenarios such as those with limited data. However, the vast landscape of pre-trained neural network architectures makes it challenging to select optimal models, particularly for researchers new to the field. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based transfer learning framework that employs an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained model for animal detection tasks. Our approach systematically evaluates and ranks candidate models based on their performance, streamlining the model selection process. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a higher detection rate while requiring significantly less computational time compared to traditional methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Skin tone recognition and generation play important roles in model fairness, healthcare, and generative AI, yet they remain challenging due to the lack of comprehensive datasets and robust methodologies. Compared to other human image analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately. To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases: LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than 20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models. Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone recognition and generation tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper examines the key factors that influence the performance of state-of-the-art gaze-based authentication. Experiments were conducted on a large-scale, in-house dataset comprising 8,849 subjects collected with Meta Quest Pro equivalent hardware running a video oculography-driven gaze estimation pipeline at 72Hz. The state-of-the-art neural network architecture was employed to study the influence of the following factors on authentication performance: eye tracking signal quality, various aspects of eye tracking calibration, and simple filtering on estimated raw gaze. We found that using the same calibration target depth for eye tracking calibration, fusing calibrated and non-calibrated gaze, and improving eye tracking signal quality all enhance authentication performance. We also found that a simple three-sample moving average filter slightly reduces authentication performance in general. While these findings hold true for the most part, some exceptions were noted.

  _Farhan Sadik, Christopher L. Newman, Stuart J. Warden, Rachel K. Surowiec_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rigid-motion artifacts, such as cortical bone streaking and trabecular smearing, hinder in vivo assessment of bone microstructures in high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Despite various motion grading techniques, no motion correction methods exist due to the lack of standardized degradation models. We optimize a conventional sinogram-based method to simulate motion artifacts in HR-pQCT images, creating paired datasets of motion-corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth, which enables seamless integration into supervised learning frameworks for motion correction. As such, we propose an Edge-enhanced Self-attention Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (ESWGAN-GP) to address motion artifacts in both simulated (source) and real-world (target) datasets. The model incorporates edge-enhancing skip connections to preserve trabecular edges and self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, facilitating motion correction. A visual geometry group (VGG)-based perceptual loss is used to reconstruct fine micro-structural features. The ESWGAN-GP achieves a mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 26.78, structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of 0.81, and visual information fidelity (VIF) of 0.76 for the source dataset, while showing improved performance on the target dataset with an SNR of 29.31, SSIM of 0.87, and VIF of 0.81. The proposed methods address a simplified representation of real-world motion that may not fully capture the complexity of in vivo motion artifacts. Nevertheless, because motion artifacts present one of the foremost challenges to more widespread adoption of this modality, these methods represent an important initial step toward implementing deep learning-based motion correction in HR-pQCT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Earth Observation have focused on large-scale foundation models. However, these models are computationally expensive, limiting their accessibility and reuse for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate compact architectures as a practical pathway toward smaller general-purpose EO models. We propose a Metadata-aware Mixture-of-Experts Masked Autoencoder (MoE-MAE) with only 2.5M parameters. The model combines sparse expert routing with geo-temporal conditioning, incorporating imagery alongside latitude/longitude and seasonal/daily cyclic encodings. We pretrain the MoE-MAE on the BigEarthNet-Landsat dataset and evaluate embeddings from its frozen encoder using linear probes. Despite its small size, the model competes with much larger architectures, demonstrating that metadata-aware pretraining improves transfer and label efficiency. To further assess generalization, we evaluate on the EuroSAT-Landsat dataset, which lacks explicit metadata, and still observe competitive performance compared to models with hundreds of millions of parameters. These results suggest that compact, metadata-aware MoE-MAEs are an efficient and scalable step toward future EO foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations. Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU. The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation enables models to recognize and segment objects from arbitrary natural language descriptions, offering the flexibility to handle novel, fine-grained, or functionally defined categories beyond fixed label sets. While this capability is crucial for large-scale urban point clouds that support applications such as digital twins, smart city management, and urban analytics, it remains largely unexplored in this domain. The main obstacles are the frequent absence of high-quality, well-aligned multi-view imagery in large-scale urban point cloud datasets and the poor generalization of existing three-dimensional (3D) segmentation pipelines across diverse urban environments with substantial variation in geometry, scale, and appearance. To address these challenges, we present OpenUrban3D, the first 3D open-vocabulary semantic segmentation framework for large-scale urban scenes that operates without aligned multi-view images, pre-trained point cloud segmentation networks, or manual annotations. Our approach generates robust semantic features directly from raw point clouds through multi-view, multi-granularity rendering, mask-level vision-language feature extraction, and sample-balanced fusion, followed by distillation into a 3D backbone model. This design enables zero-shot segmentation for arbitrary text queries while capturing both semantic richness and geometric priors. Extensive experiments on large-scale urban benchmarks, including SensatUrban and SUM, show that OpenUrban3D achieves significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and cross-scene generalization over existing methods, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and scalable solution for 3D urban scene understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is essential for interpreting 3D environments in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Recent methods achieve strong performance by exploiting different point cloud representations or incorporating data from other sensors, such as cameras or external datasets. However, these approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and require large amounts of training data, limiting their generalization in data-scarce scenarios. In this paper, we improve the performance of point-based methods by effectively learning features from 2D representations through point-plane projections, enabling the extraction of complementary information while relying solely on LiDAR data. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-aware technique for data augmentation that aligns with LiDAR sensor properties and mitigates class imbalance. We implemented and evaluated our method that applies point-plane projections onto multiple informative 2D representations of the point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to significant improvements in limited-data scenarios, while also achieving competitive results on two publicly available standard datasets, as SemanticKITTI and PandaSet.

  Glioma, an aggressive brain malignancy characterized by rapid progression and its poor prognosis, poses significant challenges for accurate evolution prediction. These challenges are exacerbated by sparse, irregularly acquired longitudinal MRI data in clinical practice, where incomplete follow-up sequences create data imbalances and make reliable modeling difficult. In this paper, we present a multitask diffusion framework for time-agnostic, pixel-wise prediction of glioma progression. The model simultaneously generates future FLAIR sequences at any chosen time point and estimates spatial probabilistic tumor evolution maps derived using signed distance fields (SDFs), allowing uncertainty quantification. To capture temporal dynamics of tumor evolution across arbitrary intervals, we integrate a pretrained deformation module that models inter-scan changes using deformation fields. Regarding the common clinical limitation of data scarcity, we implement a targeted augmentation pipeline that synthesizes complete sequences of three follow-up scans and imputes missing MRI modalities from available patient studies, improving the stability and accuracy of predictive models. Based on merely two follow-up scans at earlier timepoints, our framework produces flexible time-depending probability maps, enabling clinicians to interrogate tumor progression risks at any future temporal milestone. We further introduce a radiotherapy-weighted focal loss term that leverages radiation dose maps, as these highlight regions of greater clinical importance during model training. The proposed method was trained on a public dataset and evaluated on an internal private dataset, achieving promising results in both cases

This article explores the trade-offs between basis choice and polynomial degree to achieve accurate modeling with a low computational cost. To do this, we consider the condition number for polynomial evaluation in these bases and bound how the various inner products give norms for the variations between symbols.

  The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects, spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].

  Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are central to glioma imaging but raise safety, cost, and accessibility concerns. Predicting contrast enhancement from non-contrast MRI using machine learning (ML) offers a safer alternative, as enhancement reflects tumor aggressiveness and informs treatment planning. Yet scanner and cohort variability hinder robust model selection. We propose a stability-aware framework to identify reproducible ML pipelines for multicenter prediction of glioma MRI contrast enhancement. We analyzed 1,446 glioma cases from four TCIA datasets (UCSF-PDGM, UPENN-GB, BRATS-Africa, BRATS-TCGA-LGG). Non-contrast T1WI served as input, with enhancement derived from paired post-contrast T1WI. Using PyRadiomics under IBSI standards, 108 features were extracted and combined with 48 dimensionality reduction methods and 25 classifiers, yielding 1,200 pipelines. Rotational validation was trained on three datasets and tested on the fourth. Cross-validation prediction accuracies ranged from 0.91 to 0.96, with external testing achieving 0.87 (UCSF-PDGM), 0.98 (UPENN-GB), and 0.95 (BRATS-Africa), with an average of 0.93. F1, precision, and recall were stable (0.87 to 0.96), while ROC-AUC varied more widely (0.50 to 0.82), reflecting cohort heterogeneity. The MI linked with ETr pipeline consistently ranked highest, balancing accuracy and stability. This framework demonstrates that stability-aware model selection enables reliable prediction of contrast enhancement from non-contrast glioma MRI, reducing reliance on GBCAs and improving generalizability across centers. It provides a scalable template for reproducible ML in neuro-oncology and beyond.

  Automated tools for video editing and assembly have applications ranging from filmmaking and advertisement to content creation for social media. Previous video editing work has mainly focused on either retrieval or user interfaces, leaving actual editing to the user. In contrast, we propose to automate the core task of video editing, formulating it as sequential decision making process. Ours is a multi-agent approach. We design an Editor agent and a Critic agent. The Editor takes as input a collection of video clips together with natural language instructions and uses tools commonly found in video editing software to produce an edited sequence. On the other hand, the Critic gives natural language feedback to the editor based on the produced sequence or renders it if it is satisfactory. We introduce a learning-based approach for enabling effective communication across specialized agents to address the language-driven video editing task. Finally, we explore an LLM-as-a-judge metric for evaluating the quality of video editing system and compare it with general human preference. We evaluate our system's output video sequences qualitatively and quantitatively through a user study and find that our system vastly outperforms existing approaches in terms of coverage, time constraint satisfaction, and human preference.

  Common computer vision systems typically assume ideal pinhole cameras but fail when facing real-world camera effects such as fisheye distortion and rolling shutter, mainly due to the lack of learning from training data with camera effects. Existing data generation approaches suffer from either high costs, sim-to-real gaps or fail to accurately model camera effects. To address this bottleneck, we propose 4D Gaussian Ray Tracing (4D-GRT), a novel two-stage pipeline that combines 4D Gaussian Splatting with physically-based ray tracing for camera effect simulation. Given multi-view videos, 4D-GRT first reconstructs dynamic scenes, then applies ray tracing to generate videos with controllable, physically accurate camera effects. 4D-GRT achieves the fastest rendering speed while performing better or comparable rendering quality compared to existing baselines. Additionally, we construct eight synthetic dynamic scenes in indoor environments across four camera effects as a benchmark to evaluate generated videos with camera effects.

  Accurate segmentation and tracking of relevant elements of the surgical scene is crucial to enable context-aware intraoperative assistance and decision making. Current solutions remain tethered to domain-specific, supervised models that rely on labeled data and required domain-specific data to adapt to new surgical scenarios and beyond predefined label categories. Recent advances in prompt-driven vision foundation models (VFM) have enabled open-set, zero-shot segmentation across heterogeneous medical images. However, dependence of these models on manual visual or textual cues restricts their deployment in introperative surgical settings. We introduce a speech-guided collaborative perception (SCOPE) framework that integrates reasoning capabilities of large language model (LLM) with perception capabilities of open-set VFMs to support on-the-fly segmentation, labeling and tracking of surgical instruments and anatomy in intraoperative video streams. A key component of this framework is a collaborative perception agent, which generates top candidates of VFM-generated segmentation and incorporates intuitive speech feedback from clinicians to guide the segmentation of surgical instruments in a natural human-machine collaboration paradigm. Afterwards, instruments themselves serve as interactive pointers to label additional elements of the surgical scene. We evaluated our proposed framework on a subset of publicly available Cataract1k dataset and an in-house ex-vivo skull-base dataset to demonstrate its potential to generate on-the-fly segmentation and tracking of surgical scene. Furthermore, we demonstrate its dynamic capabilities through a live mock ex-vivo experiment. This human-AI collaboration paradigm showcase the potential of developing adaptable, hands-free, surgeon-centric tools for dynamic operating-room environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) approaches primarily rely on RGB data or signer pose information. However, combining these modalities often results in the loss of crucial details, such as hand shape and orientation, due to imprecise representations like bounding boxes. Therefore, we propose the ISLR system SegSLR, which combines RGB and pose information through promptable zero-shot video segmentation. Given the rough localization of the hands and the signer's body from pose information, we segment the respective parts through the video to maintain all relevant shape information. Subsequently, the segmentations focus the processing of the RGB data on the most relevant body parts for ISLR. This effectively combines RGB and pose information. Our evaluation on the complex ChaLearn249 IsoGD dataset shows that SegSLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, ablation studies indicate that SegSLR strongly benefits from focusing on the signer's body and hands, justifying our design choices.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Stable Part Diffusion 4D (SP4D), a framework for generating paired RGB and kinematic part videos from monocular inputs. Unlike conventional part segmentation methods that rely on appearance-based semantic cues, SP4D learns to produce kinematic parts - structural components aligned with object articulation and consistent across views and time. SP4D adopts a dual-branch diffusion model that jointly synthesizes RGB frames and corresponding part segmentation maps. To simplify the architecture and flexibly enable different part counts, we introduce a spatial color encoding scheme that maps part masks to continuous RGB-like images. This encoding allows the segmentation branch to share the latent VAE from the RGB branch, while enabling part segmentation to be recovered via straightforward post-processing. A Bidirectional Diffusion Fusion (BiDiFuse) module enhances cross-branch consistency, supported by a contrastive part consistency loss to promote spatial and temporal alignment of part predictions. We demonstrate that the generated 2D part maps can be lifted to 3D to derive skeletal structures and harmonic skinning weights with few manual adjustments. To train and evaluate SP4D, we construct KinematicParts20K, a curated dataset of over 20K rigged objects selected and processed from Objaverse XL (Deitke et al., 2023), each paired with multi-view RGB and part video sequences. Experiments show that SP4D generalizes strongly to diverse scenarios, including real-world videos, novel generated objects, and rare articulated poses, producing kinematic-aware outputs suitable for downstream animation and motion-related tasks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in text-based healthcare tasks. However, their utility in image-based applications remains unexplored. We investigate the effectiveness of LLMs for medical imaging tasks, specifically glioma classification and segmentation, and compare their performance to that of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using the BraTS 2020 dataset of multi-modal brain MRIs, we evaluated a general-purpose vision-language LLM (LLaMA 3.2 Instruct) both before and after fine-tuning, and benchmarked its performance against custom 3D CNNs. For glioma classification (Low-Grade vs. High-Grade), the CNN achieved 80% accuracy and balanced precision and recall. The general LLM reached 76% accuracy but suffered from a specificity of only 18%, often misclassifying Low-Grade tumors. Fine-tuning improved specificity to 55%, but overall performance declined (e.g., accuracy dropped to 72%). For segmentation, three methods - center point, bounding box, and polygon extraction, were implemented. CNNs accurately localized gliomas, though small tumors were sometimes missed. In contrast, LLMs consistently clustered predictions near the image center, with no distinction of glioma size, location, or placement. Fine-tuning improved output formatting but failed to meaningfully enhance spatial accuracy. The bounding polygon method yielded random, unstructured outputs. Overall, CNNs outperformed LLMs in both tasks. LLMs showed limited spatial understanding and minimal improvement from fine-tuning, indicating that, in their current form, they are not well-suited for image-based tasks. More rigorous fine-tuning or alternative training strategies may be needed for LLMs to achieve better performance, robustness, and utility in the medical space.

  _Xiaoyang Ma, Yiyang Chai, Xinran Qu, Hong Sun_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a single RGB image is ill-posed and can become physically inconsistent when the camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) and scene illumination are misspecified. We formulate RGB-to-HSI reconstruction as a physics-grounded inverse problem regularized by a nuclear norm in a learnable transform domain, and we explicitly estimate CSS and illumination to define the forward operator embedded in each iteration, ensuring colorimetric consistency. To avoid the cost and instability of full singular-value decompositions (SVDs) required by singular-value thresholding (SVT), we introduce a data-adaptive low-rank subspace SVT operator. Building on these components, we develop USCTNet, a deep unfolding solver tailored to HSI that couples a parameter estimation module with learnable proximal updates. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art RGB-based methods in reconstruction accuracy. Code:this https URL

  3D structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain scans are commonly acquired in clinical settings to monitor a wide range of neurological conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and stroke. While deep learning models have shown promising results analyzing 3D MRI across a number of brain imaging tasks, most are highly tailored for specific tasks with limited labeled data, and are not able to generalize across tasks and/or populations. The development of self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled the creation of large medical foundation models that leverage diverse, unlabeled datasets ranging from healthy to diseased data, showing significant success in 2D medical imaging applications. However, even the very few foundation models for 3D brain MRI that have been developed remain limited in resolution, scope, or accessibility. In this work, we present a general, high-resolution SimCLR-based SSL foundation model for 3D brain structural MRI, pre-trained on 18,759 patients (44,958 scans) from 11 publicly available datasets spanning diverse neurological diseases. We compare our model to Masked Autoencoders (MAE), as well as two supervised baselines, on four diverse downstream prediction tasks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Our fine-tuned SimCLR model outperforms all other models across all tasks. Notably, our model still achieves superior performance when fine-tuned using only 20% of labeled training samples for predicting Alzheimer's disease. We use publicly available code and data, and release our trained model atthis https URL, contributing a broadly applicable and accessible foundation model for clinical brain MRI analysis.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language pre-training (VLP) offers unique advantages for surgery by aligning language with surgical videos, enabling workflow understanding and transfer across tasks without relying on expert-labeled datasets. However, progress in surgical VLP remains constrained by the limited scale, procedural diversity, semantic quality, and hierarchical structure of existing datasets. In this work, we present SurgLaVi, the largest and most diverse surgical vision-language dataset to date, comprising nearly 240k clip-caption pairs from more than 200 procedures, and comprising hierarchical levels at phase-, step-, and task-level. At the core of SurgLaVi lies a fully automated pipeline that systematically generates fine-grained transcriptions of surgical videos and segments them into coherent procedural units. To ensure high-quality annotations, it applies dual-modality filtering to remove irrelevant and noisy samples. Within this framework, the resulting captions are enriched with contextual detail, producing annotations that are both semantically rich and easy to interpret. To ensure accessibility, we release SurgLaVi-\b{eta}, an open-source derivative of 113k clip-caption pairs constructed entirely from public data, which is over four times larger than existing surgical VLP datasets. To demonstrate the value of SurgLaVi datasets, we introduce SurgCLIP, a CLIP-style video-text contrastive framework with dual encoders, as a representative base model. SurgCLIP achieves consistent improvements across phase, step, action, and tool recognition, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins. These results validate that large-scale, semantically rich, and hierarchically structured datasets directly translate into stronger and more generalizable representations, establishing SurgLaVi as a key resource for developing surgical foundation models.

  Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.

  _Elias De Smijter, Renaud Detry, Christophe De Vleeschouwer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance. Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance. To address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while suppressing shared background interference. Our solution centers on two novel, specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power. Inspired by feedback differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion. IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing feature noise, leading to significant performance gains. In extensive experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses. However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%, outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by 2.75%.

  Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$ faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.

  _Aswini Kumar Patra, Lingaraj Sahoo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.

  Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations. We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans, demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:this https URLto facilitate further research. This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image qualityand style diversity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost and efficient 3D scene perception in endoscopy. In recent years, a series of methods are proposed to address the illumination inconsistency, while certain works also focus on the generalization of the model by efficiently finetuning the foundation models. However, the variety of illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenges for depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in diverse endoscopy. Firstly, considering the diverse features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetune the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from low-rank experts which are allocated based on the generalization of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with brightness inconsistency and reflectance interference. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art works on SCARED dataset and SimCol dataset. Furthermore, the proposed network also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on C3VD, Hamlyn and SERV-CT dataset. The outstanding performance of our model is further demonstrated with 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation. The proposed method could contribute to accurate endoscopy for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The evaluation codes will be released upon acceptance, while the demo videos can be found on:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training) and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information screening for improving video-language understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code:this https URL.}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we present a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level--typically at the mitral valve leaflet tips--and aligned perpendicular to the LV long axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV long axis and the basal level- mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM}-- a novel, fully automated yet manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode. \textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

  Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage. Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional inventories. In this study, the large language model GPT was used to detect various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa√ßade images. Using this data and building register data as features, machine learning models were trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm, Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT, and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

  Continual learning aims to equip AI systems with the ability to continuously acquire and adapt to new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information, similar to human learning. While traditional continual learning methods focusing on unimodal tasks have achieved notable success, the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models has brought increasing attention to Multimodal Continual Learning tasks involving multiple modalities, such as vision and language. In this setting, models are expected to not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib, we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully selected benchmarks. MCITlib will be continuously updated to reflect advances in the Multimodal Continual Learning field. The codebase is released atthis https URL.

  Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in Human Image Generation (HIG) with various control signals such as pose priors. In HIG, both accurate human poses and coherent visual quality are crucial for image generation. However, most existing methods mainly focus on pose accuracy while neglecting overall image quality, often improving pose alignment at the cost of image quality. To address this, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB), implemented as a visual codebook, provides coarse, global guidance based on input text-related visual features, improving pose accuracy while maintaining image quality, while the Dynamic pose Mask (DM) offers fine-grained local control to enhance precise pose accuracy. By injecting KB and DM at different stages of the diffusion process, our framework enhances pose accuracy through both global and local control without compromising image quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of KB-DMGen, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset. The project page and code are available atthis https URL.

  Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

  _Shuaijin Wan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges. Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in short-term motion prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR) algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face). Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving 49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method by 2.37%.

  Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data, with the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation alone producing approximately 1.6TB per day. To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures.We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models we examine. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).

  In recent years the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite images along with the advancement of computer vision models have enabled the remote monitoring of wetland surface areas. However, these models require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow and expensive to produce. To overcome this problem we use self-supervised training methods to train a model called DeepAquaCluster to segment radar satellite images into areas that separate water from land without the use of any manual annotations. Our final model outperforms other radar-based water detection techniques in our test dataset, achieving a 0.08 improvement in the Intersection Over Union metric.

  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive ``fighting fire with fire'' strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities.

In contrast to traditional neural rendering pipelines that demand known camera poses and per scene optimization, or recent feed forward methods that buckle under the computational weight of dense views, our model predicts everything in one shot. A single forward pass yields a set of 3D Gaussian primitives encoding both scene geometry and appearance, and the corresponding camera intrinsics and extrinsics for each input image. This unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets without any pose annotations. In extensive zero shot evaluations, AnySplat matches the quality of pose aware baselines in both sparse and dense view scenarios while surpassing existing pose free approaches.

  Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.

  Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on multimodal tasks. However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications. Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations. Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify semantic directions closely associated with faithfulness or hallucination, extracting more precise and disentangled hallucination-related representations. Our analysis demonstrates that interventions along the identified faithful direction can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a plug-and-play method based on SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event cameras provide micro-second latency and broad dynamic range, yet their raw streams are marred by spatial artifacts (e.g., hot pixels) and temporally inconsistent background activity. Existing methods jointly process the entire 4D event volume (x, y, p, t), forcing heavy spatio-temporal attention that inflates parameters, FLOPs, and latency. We introduce EDmamba, a compact event-denoising framework that embraces the key insight that spatial and temporal noise arise from different physical mechanisms and can therefore be suppressed independently. A polarity- and geometry-aware encoder first extracts coarse cues, which are then routed to two lightweight state-space branches: a Spatial-SSM that learns location-conditioned filters to silence persistent artifacts, and a Temporal-SSM that models causal signal dynamics to eliminate bursty background events. This decoupled design distills the network to only 88.9K parameters and 2.27GFLOPs, enabling real-time throughput of 100K events in 68ms on a single GPU, 36x faster than recent Transformer baselines. Despite its economy, EDmamba establishes new state-of-the-art accuracy on four public benchmarks, outscoring the strongest prior model by 2.1 percentage points.

  Gait recognition enables contact-free, long-range person identification that is robust to clothing variations and non-cooperative scenarios. While existing methods perform well in controlled indoor environments, they struggle with cross-vertical view scenarios, where surveillance angles vary significantly in elevation. Our experiments show up to 60\% accuracy degradation in low-to-high vertical view settings due to severe deformations and self-occlusions of key anatomical features. Current CNN and self-attention-based methods fail to effectively handle these challenges, due to their reliance on single-scale convolutions or simplistic attention mechanisms that lack effective multi-frequency feature integration. To tackle this challenge, we propose CVVNet (Cross-Vertical-View Network), a frequency aggregation architecture specifically designed for robust cross-vertical-view gait recognition. CVVNet employs a High-Low Frequency Extraction module (HLFE) that adopts parallel multi-scale convolution/max-pooling path and self-attention path as high- and low-frequency mixers for effective multi-frequency feature extraction from input silhouettes. We also introduce the Dynamic Gated Aggregation (DGA) mechanism to adaptively adjust the fusion ratio of high- and low-frequency features. The integration of our core Multi-Scale Attention Gated Aggregation (MSAGA) module, HLFE and DGA enables CVVNet to effectively handle distortions from view changes, significantly improving the recognition robustness across different vertical views. Experimental results show that our CVVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with $8.6\%$ improvement on DroneGait and $2\%$ on Gait3D compared with the best existing methods.

  Pain is a manifold condition that impacts a significant percentage of the population. Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities - including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos - and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment.

  Video question answering benefits from the rich information in videos, enabling various applications. However, the large volume of tokens generated from long videos presents challenges to memory efficiency and model performance. To alleviate this, existing works propose to compress video inputs, but often overlook the varying importance of static and dynamic information across different queries, leading to inefficient token usage within limited budgets. We propose a novel token selection strategy, \textsc{explore-then-select}, that adaptively adjusts static and dynamic information based on question requirements. Our framework first explores different token allocations between key frames, which preserve spatial details, and delta frames, which capture temporal changes. Then it employs a query-aware attention-based metric to select the optimal token combination without model updates. Our framework is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated within diverse video language models. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant performance improvements (up to 5.8\%) on multiple video question answering benchmarks. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Our objective is the automatic generation of Audio Descriptions (ADs) for edited video material, such as movies and TV series. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage framework that leverages "shots" as the fundamental units of video understanding. This includes extending temporal context to neighbouring shots and incorporating film grammar devices, such as shot scales and thread structures, to guide AD generation. Our method is compatible with both open-source and proprietary Visual-Language Models (VLMs), integrating expert knowledge from add-on modules without requiring additional training of the VLMs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance among all prior training-free approaches and even surpass fine-tuned methods on several benchmarks. To evaluate the quality of predicted ADs, we introduce a new evaluation measure -- an action score -- specifically targeted to assessing this important aspect of AD. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that treats automatic frameworks as AD generation assistants and asks them to generate multiple candidate ADs for selection.

  Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

  Recent advances in Computer Vision have introduced the concept of pretrained representation uncertainty, enabling zero-shot uncertainty estimation. This holds significant potential for Earth Observation (EO), where trustworthiness is critical, yet the complexity of EO data poses challenges to uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field.

  Traditionally, creating photo-realistic 3D head avatars requires a studio-level multi-view capture setup and expensive optimization during test-time, limiting the use of digital human doubles to the VFX industry or offline renderings.To address this shortcoming, we present Avat3r, which regresses a high-quality and animatable 3D head avatar from just a few input images, vastly reducing compute requirements during inference. More specifically, we make Large Reconstruction Models animatable and learn a powerful prior over 3D human heads from a large multi-view video dataset. For better 3D head reconstructions, we employ position maps from DUSt3R and generalized feature maps from the human foundation model Sapiens. To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video.We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts.Project website:this https URL

  For individuals with blindness or low vision (BLV), navigating complex environments can pose serious risks. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for generating scene descriptions, but their effectiveness for BLV users remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with eight BLV participants to systematically evaluate preferences for six types of LVLM descriptions. While they helped to reduce fear and improve actionability, user ratings showed wide variation in sufficiency and conciseness. Furthermore, GPT-4o--despite its strong potential to refine descriptions--was not consistently preferred by participants. We use the insights obtained from the user study to build training data for building our new automatic evaluation metric that can capture BLV preferences effectively. Our findings underscore the urgent need for BLV-centered evaluation metrics and human-in-the-loop feedback to advance LVLM description quality for accessibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Portraits or selfie images taken from a close distance typically suffer from perspective distortion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning-based rectification pipeline to mitigate the effects of perspective distortion. We learn to predict the facial depth by training a deep CNN. The estimated depth is utilized to adjust the camera-to-subject distance by moving the camera farther, increasing the camera focal length, and reprojecting the 3D image features to the new perspective. The reprojected features are then fed to an inpainting module to fill in the missing pixels. We leverage a differentiable renderer to enable end-to-end training of our depth estimation and feature extraction nets to improve the rectified outputs. To boost the results of the inpainting module, we incorporate an auxiliary module to predict the horizontal movement of the camera which decreases the area that requires hallucination of challenging face parts such as ears. Unlike previous works, we process the full-frame input image at once without cropping the subject's face and processing it separately from the rest of the body, eliminating the need for complex post-processing steps to attach the face back to the subject's body. To train our network, we utilize the popular game engine Unreal Engine to generate a large synthetic face dataset containing various subjects, head poses, expressions, eyewear, clothes, and lighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our rectification pipeline outperforms previous methods, and produces comparable results with a time-consuming 3D GAN-based method while being more than 260 times faster.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Depth completion upgrades sparse depth measurements into dense depth maps guided by a conventional image. Existing methods for this highly ill-posed task operate in tightly constrained settings and tend to struggle when applied to images outside the training domain or when the available depth measurements are sparse, irregularly distributed, or of varying density. Inspired by recent advances in monocular depth estimation, we reframe depth completion as an image-conditional depth map generation guided by sparse measurements. Our method, Marigold-DC, builds on a pretrained latent diffusion model for monocular depth estimation and injects the depth observations as test-time guidance via an optimization scheme that runs in tandem with the iterative inference of denoising diffusion. The method exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization across a diverse range of environments and handles even extremely sparse guidance effectively. Our results suggest that contemporary monocular depth priors greatly robustify depth completion: it may be better to view the task as recovering dense depth from (dense) image pixels, guided by sparse depth; rather than as inpainting (sparse) depth, guided by an image.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel approach to shape editing, building on recent progress in 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. We formulate shape editing as a conditional reconstruction problem, where the model must reconstruct the input shape with the exception of a specified 3D region, in which the geometry should be generated from the conditional signal. To this end, we train a conditional Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for masked reconstruction, using multi-view consistent masks rendered from a randomly generated 3D occlusion, and using one clean viewpoint as the conditional signal. During inference, we manually define a 3D region to edit and provide an edited image from a canonical viewpoint to fill that region. We demonstrate that, in just a single forward pass, our method not only preserves the input geometry in the unmasked region through reconstruction capabilities on par with SoTA, but is also expressive enough to perform a variety of mesh edits from a single image guidance that past works struggle with, while being 2-10x faster than the top-performing prior work.

  While open-source vision-language models perform well on simple question-answering, they still struggle with complex questions that require both perceptual and reasoning capabilities. We propose LATTE, a family of vision-language models that have LeArned to Think wiTh vision spEcialists. By offloading perception to state-of-the-art vision models, our approach enables vision-language models to focus solely on reasoning over high-quality perceptual information. To train LATTE, we synthesize and filter a large dataset of 293K multi-modal reasoning traces over perceptual outputs of vision specialists. LATTE trained on this data achieves significant 4-5% gains over baselines across 6 benchmarks covering both perception and reasoning abilities. Ablation studies reveal that the effectiveness of multi-modal reasoning traces depends on the data sources, formats, and quality of thoughts.

  The interpretation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is critical for monitoring Earth's dynamic processes-yet previous change detection methods, which produce binary or semantic masks, fall short of providing human-readable insights into changes. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have opened a new frontier by fusing visual and linguistic modalities, enabling spatio-temporal vision-language understanding: models that not only capture spatial and temporal dependencies to recognize changes but also provide a richer interactive semantic analysis of temporal images (e.g., generate descriptive captions and answer natural-language queries). In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review of RS-STVLMs. The survey covers the evolution of models from early task-specific models to recent general foundation models that leverage powerful large language models. We discuss progress in representative tasks, such as change captioning, change question answering, and change grounding. Moreover, we systematically dissect the fundamental components and key technologies underlying these models, and review the datasets and evaluation metrics that have driven the field. By synthesizing task-level insights with a deep dive into shared architectural patterns, we aim to illuminate current achievements and chart promising directions for future research in spatio-temporal vision-language understanding for remote sensing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in image classification by leveraging predefined sets of labels to construct text prompts for zero-shot reasoning. However, these approaches face significant limitations in undefined domains, where the label space is vocabulary-unknown and composite. We thus introduce Generative Semantic Labels (GSLs), a novel task that aims to predict a comprehensive set of semantic labels for an image without being constrained by a predefined labels set. Unlike traditional zero-shot classification, GSLs generates multiple semantic-level labels, encompassing objects, scenes, attributes, and relationships, thereby providing a richer and more accurate representation of image content. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Action (CoA), an innovative method designed to tackle the GSLs task. CoA is motivated by the observation that enriched contextual information significantly improves generative performance during inference. Specifically, CoA decomposes the GSLs task into a sequence of detailed actions. Each action extracts and merges key information from the previous step, passing enriched context to the next, ultimately guiding the VLM to generate comprehensive and accurate semantic labels. We evaluate the effectiveness of CoA through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics, validating the capability of CoA to generate accurate and contextually rich semantic labels. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in generative semantic labels but also opens new avenues for applying VLMs in open-ended and dynamic real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) methods, which develop source-domain training strategies to enhance model transferability, face challenges with large-scale pre-trained models (LMs) due to inaccessible source data and training strategies. Moreover, fine-tuning LMs for CDFSL demands substantial computational resources, limiting practicality. This paper addresses the source-free CDFSL (SF-CDFSL) problem, tackling few-shot learning (FSL) in the target domain using only pre-trained models and a few target samples without source data or strategies. To overcome the challenge of inaccessible source data, this paper introduces Step-wise Distribution Alignment Guided Style Prompt Tuning (StepSPT), which implicitly narrows domain gaps through prediction distribution optimization. StepSPT proposes a style prompt to align target samples with the desired distribution and adopts a dual-phase optimization process. In the external process, a step-wise distribution alignment strategy factorizes prediction distribution optimization into a multi-step alignment problem to tune the style prompt. In the internal process, the classifier is updated using standard cross-entropy loss. Evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that StepSPT outperforms existing prompt tuning-based methods and SOTAs. Ablation studies further verify its effectiveness. Code will be made publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autonomous systems rely on accurate 3D object detection from LiDAR data, yet most detectors are limited to a predefined set of known classes, making them vulnerable to unexpected out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. In this work, we present HD-OOD3D, a novel two-stage method for detecting unknown objects. We demonstrate the superiority of two-stage approaches over single-stage methods, achieving more robust detection of unknown objects while addressing key challenges in the evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the standard evaluation protocol for OOD detection, revealing the critical impact of hyperparameter choices. To address the challenge of scaling the learning of unknown objects, we explore unsupervised training strategies to generate pseudo-labels for unknowns. Among the different approaches evaluated, our experiments show that top-5 auto-labelling offers more promising performance compared to simple resizing techniques.

  Multi-sensor fusion significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which is crucial for autonomous driving and robotics. However, most existing approaches depend on high-resolution images and complex networks to achieve top performance, hindering their deployment in practical scenarios. Moreover, current multi-sensor fusion approaches mainly focus on improving feature fusion while largely neglecting effective supervision strategies for those features. To address these issues, we propose DAOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that leverages 3D object detection supervision to assist in achieving superior performance, while using a deployment-friendly image backbone and practical input resolution. In addition, we introduce a BEV View Range Extension strategy to mitigate performance degradation caused by lower image resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAOcc achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin using only a ResNet-50 backbone and 256*704 input resolution. With TensorRT optimization, DAOcc reaches 104.9 FPS while maintaining 54.2 mIoU on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. Code is available atthis https URL.

  Scalp disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, yet remain underdiagnosed due to limited access to expert evaluation and the high cost of annotation. Although AI-based approaches hold great promise, their practical deployment is hindered by challenges such as severe data imbalance and the absence of pixel-level segmentation labels. To address these issues, we propose ScalpVision, an AI-driven system for the holistic diagnosis of scalp diseases. In ScalpVision, effective hair segmentation is achieved using pseudo image-label pairs and an innovative prompting method in the absence of traditional hair masking labels. Additionally, ScalpVision introduces DiffuseIT-M, a generative model adopted for dataset augmentation while maintaining hair information, facilitating improved predictions of scalp disease severity. Our experimental results affirm ScalpVision's efficiency in diagnosing a variety of scalp conditions, showcasing its potential as a valuable tool in dermatological care.

  Can large multimodal models have a human-like ability for emotional and social reasoning, and if so, how does it work? Recent research has discovered emergent theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). LLMs can reason about people's mental states by solving various text-based ToM tasks that ask questions about the actors' ToM (e.g., human belief, desire, intention). However, human reasoning in the wild is often grounded in dynamic scenes across time. Thus, we consider videos a new medium for examining spatio-temporal ToM reasoning ability. Specifically, we ask explicit probing questions about videos with abundant social and emotional reasoning content. We develop a pipeline for multimodal LLM for ToM reasoning using video and text. We also enable explicit ToM reasoning by retrieving key frames for answering a ToM question, which reveals how multimodal LLMs reason about ToM.

  Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level multi-image reasoning and visual working memory is not well-established. One such challenge is matrix reasoning - the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the matrix reasoning tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA to evaluate the visual cognition capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human visual cognition studies. Based on the training data of MaRs-VQA, we also finetune a baseline model Qwen2-VCog with multi-stage cognition reasoning annotations. Our comparative experiments with different baselines reveal a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence, highlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that the public release of MaRs-VQA and the Qwen2-VCog baseline model will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with human-like visual cognition abilities.

  Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large. All translated captions and metadata (language, CLIP score, etc.) are available on HuggingFace.

  Effectively modeling global context information in hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is crucial, but prevailing methods using convolution or transformers still face localized or computational efficiency limitations. Inspired by the emerging Selective State Space Model (Mamba) with nearly linear computational complexity and efficient long-term modeling, we present a novel HSI denoising network named HSIDMamba (HSDM). HSDM is tailored to exploit the capture of potential spatial-spectral dependencies effectively and efficiently for HSI denoising. In particular, HSDM comprises multiple Hyperspectral Continuous Scan Blocks (HCSB) to strengthen spatial-spectral interactions. HCSB links forward and backward scans and enhances information from eight directions through the State Space Model (SSM), strengthening the context representation learning of HSDM and improving denoising performance more effectively. In addition, to enhance the utilization of spectral information and mitigate the degradation problem caused by long-range scanning, spectral attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations against HSI denoising benchmarks validate the superior performance of HSDM, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing the efficiency of the transformer method SERT by 31%.

  Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.

  Semantic image synthesis (SIS) shows good promises for sensor simulation. However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This article presents a general Bayesian learning framework for multi-modal groupwise image registration. The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.

  Contemporary autonomous vehicle (AV) benchmarks have advanced techniques for training 3D detectors. While class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution in the real world, existing benchmarks only focus on a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian and car) and neglect many rare but crucial classes (e.g., emergency vehicle and stroller). However, AVs must reliably detect both common and rare classes for safe operation in the open world. We address this challenge by formally studying the problem of Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates all annotated classes, including those in-the-tail. We address LT3D with hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across classes, and introduce diagnostic metrics that award partial credit to "reasonable" mistakes with respect to the semantic hierarchy. Further, we point out that rare-class accuracy is particularly improved via multi-modal late fusion (MMLF) of independently trained uni-modal LiDAR and RGB detectors. Such an MMLF framework allows us to leverage large-scale uni-modal datasets (with more examples for rare classes) to train better uni-modal detectors. Finally, we examine three critical components of our simple MMLF approach from first principles: whether to train 2D or 3D RGB detectors for fusion, whether to match RGB and LiDAR detections in 3D or the projected 2D image plane, and how to fuse matched detections. Extensive experiments reveal that 2D RGB detectors achieve better recognition accuracy for rare classes than 3D RGB detectors, matching on the 2D image plane mitigates depth estimation errors for better matching, and score calibration and probabilistic fusion notably improves the final performance further. Our MMLF significantly outperforms prior work for LT3D, particularly improving on the six rarest classes from 12.8 to 20.0 mAP! Our code and models are available on our project page.

  Dynamic convolution demonstrates outstanding representation capabilities, which are crucial for natural image segmentation. However, it fails when applied to medical image segmentation (MIS) and infrared small target segmentation (IRSTS) due to limited data and limited fitting capacity. In this paper, we propose a new type of dynamic convolution called dynamic parameter convolution (DPConv) which shows superior fitting capacity, and it can efficiently leverage features from deep layers of encoder in reconstruction tasks to generate DPConv kernels that adapt to inputthis http URL, we observe that DPConv, built upon deep features derived from reconstruction tasks, significantly enhances downstream segmentation performance. We refer to the segmentation network integrated with DPConv generated from reconstruction network as the siamese reconstruction-segmentation network (SRS). We conduct extensive experiments on seven datasets including five medical datasets and two infrared datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can show superior performance over several recently proposed methods. Furthermore, the zero-shot segmentation under unseen modality demonstrates the generalization of DPConv. The code is available at:this https URL.

  Adversarial attacks hamper the decision-making ability of neural networks by perturbing the input signal. The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Millions of hearing impaired people around the world routinely use some variants of sign languages to communicate, thus the automatic translation of a sign language is meaningful and important. Currently, there are two sub-problems in Sign Language Recognition (SLR), i.e., isolated SLR that recognizes word by word and continuous SLR that translates entire sentences. Existing continuous SLR methods typically utilize isolated SLRs as building blocks, with an extra layer of preprocessing (temporal segmentation) and another layer of post-processing (sentence synthesis). Unfortunately, temporal segmentation itself is non-trivial and inevitably propagates errors into subsequent steps. Worse still, isolated SLR methods typically require strenuous labeling of each word separately in a sentence, severely limiting the amount of attainable training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel continuous sign recognition framework, the Hierarchical Attention Network with Latent Space (LS-HAN), which eliminates the preprocessing of temporal segmentation. The proposed LS-HAN consists of three components: a two-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for video feature representation generation, a Latent Space (LS) for semantic gap bridging, and a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for latent space based recognition. Experiments are carried out on two large scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

  _Hunjae Lee, Corey Clark_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.

  _Antonin Sulc_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.

  _Collin Guo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human face synthesis and manipulation are increasingly important in entertainment and AI, with a growing demand for highly realistic, identity-preserving images even when only unpaired, unaligned datasets are available. We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure, and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these out-of-distribution (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding climate adaptation. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in providing precise, high-speed climate predictions, their ability to generalize under distribution shifts remains a significant limitation that has been underexplored in climate contexts. This research systematically evaluates state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in diverse OOD scenarios by adapting established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability across scenarios, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models. These findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk forecasting.

  _Aryaman Reddi, Gabriele Tiboni, Jan Peters, Carlo D'Eramo_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph machine learning models often achieve similar overall performance yet behave differently at the node level, failing on different subsets of nodes with varying reliability. Standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy obscure these fine grained differences, making it difficult to diagnose when and where models fail. We introduce NodePro, a node profiling framework that enables fine-grained diagnosis of model behavior by assigning interpretable profile scores to individual nodes. These scores combine data-centric signals, such as feature dissimilarity, label uncertainty, and structural ambiguity, with model-centric measures of prediction confidence and consistency during training. By aligning model behavior with these profiles, NodePro reveals systematic differences between models, even when aggregate metrics are indistinguishable. We show that node profiles generalize to unseen nodes, supporting prediction reliability without ground-truth labels. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of NodePro in identifying semantically inconsistent or corrupted nodes in a structured knowledge graph, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world settings.

  _Anirudha Majumdar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss. In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is deployed in.

  _Zijian Wang, Peng Tao, Jifan Shi, Rui Bao, Rui Liu, Luonan Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Conventional autonomous trading systems struggle to balance computational efficiency and market responsiveness due to their fixed operating frequency. We propose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market volatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for high-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of 25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return) and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return). Our work demonstrates that dynamic, hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining high computational efficiency.

  _Mayur Patil, Qadeer Ahmed, Shawn Midlam-Mohler_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then, validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying the model's robustness.

  _Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it. Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural ordinary differential equations offer an effective framework for modeling dynamical systems by learning a continuous-time vector field. However, they rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the current state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the dynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes especially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex systems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies, existing approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling. In addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we investigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning non-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform offers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and proven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We integrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics models and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test performance on synthetic benchmarks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To enable broader deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is essential to identify the best-performing model under strict memory constraints. We present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over 10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1) search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing.

  _Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy. In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the "average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our method.

  Existing similarity-based weakly supervised learning approaches often rely on precise similarity annotations between data pairs, which may inadvertently expose sensitive label information and raise privacy risks. To mitigate this issue, we propose Uncertain Similarity and Unlabeled Learning (USimUL), a novel framework where each similarity pair is embedded with an uncertainty component to reduce label leakage. In this paper, we propose an unbiased risk estimator that learns from uncertain similarity and unlabeled data. Additionally, we theoretically prove that the estimator achieves statistically optimal parametric convergence rates. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification performance compared to conventional similarity-based approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models equipped with Web search, information retrieval tools, and other agentic capabilities are beginning to supplant traditional search engines. As users start to rely on LLMs for information on many topics, including controversial and debatable issues, it is important to understand how the stances and opinions expressed in LLM outputs are influenced by the documents they use as their information sources.In this paper, we present MillStone, the first benchmark that aims to systematically measure the effect of external arguments on the stances that LLMs take on controversial issues (not all of them political). We apply MillStone to nine leading LLMs and measure how ``open-minded'' they are to arguments supporting opposite sides of these issues, whether different LLMs agree with each other, which arguments LLMs find most persuasive, and whether these arguments are the same for different LLMs.In general, we find that LLMs are open-minded on most issues. An authoritative source of information can easily sway an LLM's stance, highlighting the importance of source selection and the risk that LLM-based information retrieval and search systems can be manipulated.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating tabular generators remains a challenging problem, as the unique causal structural prior of heterogeneous tabular data does not lend itself to intuitive human inspection. Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a tabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies with the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often neglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model performance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as quantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to ground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly considers structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We introduce a new evaluation metric, $\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the assessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal structures. In addition, we present $\textbf{TabStruct}$, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark offering large-scale quantitative analysis on 13 tabular generators from nine distinct categories, across 29 datasets. Our results demonstrate that global utility provides a task-independent, domain-agnostic lens for tabular generator performance. We release the TabStruct benchmark suite, including all datasets, evaluation pipelines, and raw results. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Domain Adaptation (FDA) is a federated learning (FL) approach that improves model performance at the target client by collaborating with source clients while preserving data privacy. FDA faces two primary challenges: domain shifts between source and target data and limited labeled data at the target. Most existing FDA methods focus on domain shifts, assuming ample target data, yet often neglect the combined challenges of both domain shifts and data scarcity. Moreover, approaches that address both challenges fail to prioritize sharing relevant information from source clients according to the target's objective. In this paper, we propose FedDAF, a novel approach addressing both challenges in FDA. FedDAF uses similarity-based aggregation of the global source model and target model by calculating model functional distance from their mean gradient fields computed on target data. This enables effective model aggregation based on the target objective, constructed using target data, even with limited data. While computing model functional distance between these two models, FedDAF computes the angle between their mean gradient fields and then normalizes with the Gompertz function. To construct the global source model, all the local source models are aggregated using simple average in the server. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDAF's superiority over existing FL, PFL, and FDA methods in terms of achieving better test accuracy.

  Current unlearning techniques and safety training consistently fail to remove dangerous knowledge from language models. We analyze the root causes and propose a highly selective technique which unlearns robustly and without disrupting general performance.We perform PCA on activations and module output gradients to identify subspaces containing common representations, and collapse them before calculating unlearning updates. This way we avoid unlearning general representations, and only target those specific to the unlearned facts.When unlearning WMDP dataset facts from Llama-3.1-8B, we drop post-attack accuracy 80x more than our best baseline (Circuit Breakers) on biohazardous facts and 30x more on cyberhazardous facts. Despite this, we disrupt general performance 30x less (only 0.1% WikiText loss increase), while requiring less than 3 GPU-seconds per fact.

  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful models for graph-structured data, with broad applications. However, the interplay between GNN parameter optimization, expressivity, and generalization remains poorly understood. We address this by introducing an efficient learnable dimensionality reduction method for visualizing GNN loss landscapes, and by analyzing the effects of over-smoothing, jumping knowledge, quantization, sparsification, and preconditioner on GNN optimization. Our learnable projection method surpasses the state-of-the-art PCA-based approach, enabling accurate reconstruction of high-dimensional parameters with lower memory usage. We further show that architecture, sparsification, and optimizer's preconditioning significantly impact the GNN optimization landscape and their training process and final prediction performance. These insights contribute to developing more efficient designs of GNN architectures and training strategies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Real-time fall detection is crucial for enabling timely interventions and mitigating the severe health consequences of falls, particularly in older adults. However, existing methods often rely on simulated data or assumptions such as prior knowledge of fall events, limiting their real-world applicability. Practical deployment also requires efficient computation and robust evaluation metrics tailored to continuous monitoring. This paper presents a real-time fall detection framework for continuous monitoring without prior knowledge of fall events. Using over 60 hours of inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from the FARSEEING real-world falls dataset, we employ recent efficient classifiers to compute fall probabilities in streaming mode. To enhance robustness, we introduce a cost-sensitive learning strategy that tunes the decision threshold using a cost function reflecting the higher risk of missed falls compared to false alarms. Unlike many methods that achieve high recall only at the cost of precision, our framework achieved Recall of 1.00, Precision of 0.84, and an F1 score of 0.91 on FARSEEING, detecting all falls while keeping false alarms low, with average inference time below 5 ms per sample. These results demonstrate that cost-sensitive threshold tuning enhances the robustness of accelerometer-based fall detection. They also highlight the potential of our computationally efficient framework for deployment in real-time wearable sensor systems for continuous monitoring.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  It was recently shown that the loss function used for training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) exhibits local minima at solutions corresponding to fixed points of dynamical systems. In the forward setting, where the PINN is trained to solve initial value problems, these local minima can interfere with training and potentially leading to physically incorrect solutions. Building on stability theory, this paper proposes a regularization scheme that penalizes solutions corresponding to unstable fixed points. Experimental results on four dynamical systems, including the Lotka-Volterra model and the van der Pol oscillator, show that our scheme helps avoiding physically incorrect solutions and substantially improves the training success rate of PINNs.

  Understanding how atmospheric molecular clusters form and grow is key to resolving one of the biggest uncertainties in climate modelling: the formation of new aerosol particles. While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression (KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rise of large foundation models, split inference (SI) has emerged as a popular computational paradigm for deploying models across lightweight edge devices and cloud servers, addressing data privacy and computational cost concerns. However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in SI scenarios. Code is available at:this https URL.

  Traditional disaster analysis and modelling tools for assessing the severity of a disaster are predictive in nature. Based on the past observational data, these tools prescribe how the current input state (e.g., environmental conditions, situation reports) results in a severity assessment. However, these systems are not meant to be interventional in the causal sense, where the user can modify the current input state to simulate counterfactual "what-if" scenarios. In this work, we provide an alternative interventional tool that complements traditional disaster modelling tools by leveraging real-time data sources like satellite imagery, news, and social media. Our tool also helps understand the causal attribution of different factors on the estimated severity, over any given region of interest. In addition, we provide actionable recourses that would enable easier mitigation planning. Our source code is publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Telecom domain 3GPP documents are replete with images containing sequence diagrams. Advances in Vision-Language Large Models (VLMs) have eased conversion of such images to machine-readable PlantUML (puml) formats. However, there is a gap in evaluation of such conversions - existing works do not compare puml scripts for various components. In this work, we propose performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of such conversions. A dataset of sequence diagrams from 3GPP documents is chosen to be representative of domain-specific actual scenarios. We compare puml outputs from two VLMs - Claude Sonnet and GPT-4V - against manually created ground truth representations. We use version control tools to capture differences and introduce standard performance metrics to measure accuracies along various components: participant identification, message flow accuracy, sequence ordering, and grouping construct preservation. We demonstrate effectiveness of proposed metrics in quantifying conversion errors across various components of puml scripts. The results show that nodes, edges and messages are accurately captured. However, we observe that VLMs do not necessarily perform well on complex structures such as notes, box, groups. Our experiments and performance metrics indicates a need for better representation of these components in training data for fine-tuned VLMs.

  Assessing the impact of a disaster in terms of asset losses and human casualties is essential for preparing effective response plans. Traditional methods include offline assessments conducted on the ground, where volunteers and first responders work together to collect the estimate of losses through windshield surveys or on-ground inspection. However, these methods have a time delay and are prone to different biases. Recently, various online data sources, including social media, news reports, aerial imagery, and satellite data, have been utilized to evaluate the impact of disasters. Online data sources provide real-time data streams for estimating the offline impact. Limited research exists on how different online sources help estimate disaster impact at a given administrative unit. In our work, we curate a comprehensive dataset by collecting data from multiple online sources for a few billion-dollar disasters at the county level. We also analyze how online estimates compare with traditional offline-based impact estimates for the disaster. Our findings provide insight into how different sources can provide complementary information to assess the disaster.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is essential for identifying malicious activities, fraud, and unexpected behaviors in real-world systems such as cybersecurity and power grids. However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions. Our results show that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH is practical and effective for fast, accurate anomaly detection in large-scale streaming graphs.Keywords: Anomaly Detection, Streaming, Real-time, Dynamic Graphs, Edge Streams, Tensor Sketching

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in capabilities, ensuring their safety against jailbreak attacks remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel safety alignment approach called Answer-Then-Check, which enhances LLM robustness against malicious prompts by applying thinking ability to mitigate jailbreaking problems before producing a final answer to the user. Our method enables models to directly answer the question in their thought and then critically evaluate its safety before deciding whether to provide it. To implement this approach, we construct the Reasoned Safety Alignment (ReSA) dataset, comprising 80K examples that teach models to reason through direct responses and then analyze their safety. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the Pareto frontier with superior safety capability while decreasing over-refusal rates on over-refusal benchmarks. Notably, the model fine-tuned with ReSA maintains general reasoning capabilities on benchmarks like MMLU, MATH500, and HumanEval. Besides, our method equips models with the ability to perform safe completion. Unlike post-hoc methods that can only reject harmful queries, our model can provide helpful and safe alternative responses for sensitive topics (e.g., self-harm). Furthermore, we discover that training on a small subset of just 500 examples can achieve comparable performance to using the full dataset, suggesting that safety alignment may require less data than previously assumed.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

  Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance. However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically, it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir structure and the periodicity of the dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective network state classification is a primary task for ensuring network security and optimizing performance. Existing deep learning models have shown considerable progress in this area. Some methods excel at analyzing the complex temporal periodicities found in traffic data, while graph-based approaches are adept at modeling the dynamic dependencies between different variables. However, a key trade-off remains, as these methods struggle to capture both characteristics simultaneously. Models focused on temporal patterns often overlook crucial variable dependencies, whereas those centered on dependencies may fail to capture fine-grained temporal details. To address this trade-off, we introduce DAPNet, a framework based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture. DAPNet integrates three specialized networks for periodic analysis, dynamic cross-variable correlation modeling, and hybrid temporal feature extraction. A learnable gating network dynamically assigns weights to experts based on the input sample and computes a weighted fusion of their outputs. Furthermore, a hybrid regularization loss function ensures stable training and addresses the common issue of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on two large-scale network intrusion detection datasets (CICIDS2017/2018) validate DAPNet's higher accuracy for its target application. The generalizability of the architectural design is evaluated across ten public UEA benchmark datasets, positioning DAPNet as a specialized framework for network state classification.

  Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique that allows for the reconstruction of a signal from a small set of measurements. The key idea behind compressed sensing is that many real-world signals are inherently sparse, meaning that they can be efficiently represented in a different space with only a few components compared to their original space representation. In this paper we will explore the mathematical formulation behind compressed sensing, its logic and pathologies, and apply compressed sensing to real world signals.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial exam- ples, posing critical security challenges in real-world applications. While Adversarial Training (AT ) is a widely adopted defense mechanism to enhance robustness, it often incurs a trade-off by degrading performance on unperturbed, natural data. Recent efforts have highlighted that larger models exhibit enhanced robustness over their smaller counterparts. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that such robustness can be sys- tematically distilled from large teacher models into compact student models. To achieve better performance, we introduce Dice Adversarial Robustness Distillation (DARD), a novel method designed to transfer robustness through a tailored knowledge distillation paradigm. Addition- ally, we propose Dice Projected Gradient Descent (DPGD), an adversar- ial example generalization method optimized for effective attack. Our ex- tensive experiments demonstrate that the DARD approach consistently outperforms adversarially trained networks with the same architecture, achieving superior robustness and standard accuracy.

  _Divya Jyoti Bajpai, Manjesh Kumar Hanawal_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Inference latency and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the bottlenecks in deploying them in critical applications like sensitive tasks. Early Exit (EE) DNNs overcome the latency issues by allowing samples to exit from intermediary layers if they attain `high' confidence scores on the predicted class. However, the DNNs are known to exhibit overconfidence, which can lead to many samples exiting early and render EE strategies untrustworthy. We use Selective Prediction (SP) to overcome this issue by checking the `hardness' of the samples rather than just relying on the confidence score alone. We propose SPEED, a novel approach that uses Deferral Classifiers (DCs) at each layer to check the hardness of samples before performing EEs. Specifically, the DCs identify if a sample is hard to predict at an intermediary layer, leading to hallucination, and defer it to an expert. Early detection of hard samples for inference prevents the wastage of computational resources and improves trust by deferring the hard samples to the expert. We demonstrate that EE aided with SP improves both accuracy and latency. Our method minimizes the risk of wrong prediction by $50\%$ with a speedup of $2.05\times$ as compared to the final layer.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Prior works in multi-objective reinforcement learning typically use linear reward scalarization with fixed weights, which provably fail to capture non-convex Pareto fronts and thus yield suboptimal results. This limitation becomes especially critical in online preference alignment for large language models. Here, stochastic trajectories generated by parameterized policies create highly non-linear and non-convex mappings from parameters to objectives that no single static weighting scheme can find optimal trade-offs. We address this limitation by introducing dynamic reward weighting, which adaptively adjusts reward weights during the online reinforcement learning process. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed-weight interpolation, our dynamic weighting continuously balances and prioritizes objectives in training, facilitating effective exploration of Pareto fronts in objective space. We introduce two approaches of increasing sophistication and generalizability: (1) hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and (2) gradient-based weight optimization, offering a versatile toolkit for online multi-objective alignment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate their compatibility with commonly used online reinforcement learning algorithms (including GRPO, REINFORCE, and RLOO), effectiveness across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, and applicability to different model families, consistently achieving Pareto dominant solutions with fewer training steps than fixed-weight linear scalarization baselines.

  This study presents a deep tabular learning framework for predicting crash severity in electric vehicle (EV) collisions using real-world crash data from Texas (2017-2023). After filtering for electric-only vehicles, 23,301 EV-involved crash records were analyzed. Feature importance techniques using XGBoost and Random Forest identified intersection relation, first harmful event, person age, crash speed limit, and day of week as the top predictors, along with advanced safety features like automatic emergency braking. To address class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) resampling was applied. Three state-of-the-art deep tabular models, TabPFN, MambaNet, and MambaAttention, were benchmarked for severity prediction. While TabPFN demonstrated strong generalization, MambaAttention achieved superior performance in classifying severe injury cases due to its attention-based feature reweighting. The findings highlight the potential of deep tabular architectures for improving crash severity prediction and enabling data-driven safety interventions in EV crash contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Existing AI system benchmarks such as MLPerf often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving AI landscape, making it difficult to support informed deployment, optimization, and co-design decisions for AI systems. We suggest that benchmarking itself can be framed as an AI task - one in which models are continuously evaluated and optimized across diverse datasets, software, and hardware, using key metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, energy consumption, and cost. To support this perspective, we present FlexBench: a modular extension of the MLPerf LLM inference benchmark, integrated with HuggingFace and designed to provide relevant and actionable insights. Benchmarking results and metadata are collected into an Open MLPerf Dataset, which can be collaboratively curated, extended, and leveraged for predictive modeling and feature engineering. We successfully validated the FlexBench concept through MLPerf Inference submissions, including evaluations of DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.3 on commodity servers. The broader objective is to enable practitioners to make cost-effective AI deployment decisions that reflect their available resources, requirements, and constraints.

  With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven music generation has become a vibrant and fruitful area of research. However, the representation of musical data remains a significant challenge. To address this, a novel, machine-learning-friendly music notation system, YNote, was developed. This study leverages YNote to train an effective classification model capable of distinguishing whether a piece of music was composed by a human (Native), a rule-based algorithm (Algorithm Generated), or an LLM (LLM Generated). We frame this as a text classification problem, applying the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to extract structural features from YNote sequences and using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address data imbalance. The resulting model achieves an accuracy of 98.25%, successfully demonstrating that YNote retains sufficient stylistic information for analysis. More importantly, the model can identify the unique " technological fingerprints " left by different AI generation techniques, providing a powerful tool for tracing the origins of AI-generated content.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically assume stationary environment dynamics. Yet in real-world applications such as healthcare, robotics, and finance, transition probabilities or reward functions may evolve, leading to model drift. This paper proposes a novel framework to detect such drifts by analyzing the distributional changes in sequences of agent behavior. Specifically, we introduce a suite of edit operation-based measures to quantify deviations between state-action trajectories generated under stationary and perturbed conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that these measures can effectively distinguish drifted from non-drifted scenarios, even under varying levels of noise, providing a practical tool for drift detection in non-stationary RL environments.

  Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) is a notable phenomenon in the loss landscapes of neural networks, wherein independently trained models have been observed to be connected--up to permutation symmetries--by linear paths in parameter space along which the loss remains consistently low. This observation challenges classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry. Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures--a class of models known for their scalability and computational efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks--referred to as experts--through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function. Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations--including dense, sparse, and shared-expert variants--under a wide range of model settings and datasets of varying scales and modalities. Our results confirm the existence of LMC in MoE architectures and offer fundamental insights into the functional landscape and optimization dynamics of deep learning models.

  Recorded history shows the long coexistence of humans and animals, suggesting it began much earlier. Despite some beneficial interdependence, many animals carry viral diseases that can spread to humans. These diseases are known as zoonotic diseases. Recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, Monkeypox and swine flu viruses have shown how these viruses can disrupt human life and cause death. Fast and accurate predictions of the host from which the virus spreads can help prevent these diseases from spreading. This work presents BiLSTM-VHP, a lightweight bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM)-based architecture that can predict the host from the nucleotide sequence of orthohantavirus, rabies lyssavirus, and rotavirus A with high accuracy. The proposed model works with nucleotide sequences of 400 bases in length and achieved a prediction accuracy of 89.62% for orthohantavirus, 96.58% for rotavirus A, and 77.22% for rabies lyssavirus outperforming previous studies. Moreover, performance of the model is assessed using the confusion matrix, F-1 score, precision, recall, microaverage AUC. In addition, we introduce three curated datasets of orthohantavirus, rotavirus A, and rabies lyssavirus containing 8,575, 95,197, and 22,052 nucleotide sequences divided into 9, 12, and 29 host classes, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adversarial training has been widely studied in recent years due to its role in improving model robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper focuses on comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including centralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning environments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model flatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general theoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from local minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models. We show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the attack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used, decentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and diffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the centralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the perturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold. In the simulation results, we illustrate our theoretical findings and systematically compare the performance of models obtained through decentralized and centralized adversarial training algorithms. The results highlight the potential of decentralized strategies to enhance the robustness of models in distributed settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Opal, an operator view of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Objectives are expressed as ladders of two primitives on a base utility: additive penalties and multiplicative pairwise weights. We describe a simple reduction law with if-and-only-if conditions: such ladders collapse to a normal form on pairwise margins when the reference is fixed, penalties are additive, and weights are independent of intermediate margins. When these assumptions do not hold (reference shift, non-additive gates, score-dependent weights), small examples demonstrate non-reducibility.Building on this view, we introduce GKPO (Generalized Kernel Preference Object), a canonical schema in which many RLHF methods can be represented and, when reducible, mapped back from. GKPO provides a standard JSON serialization, canonicalization and hashing rules, and explicit flags with finite witnesses when assumptions fail.We illustrate these ideas with GKPO examples for DPO, RRHF, and ORPO, along with cross-method conversions (where assumptions permit) and minimal stress tests (SHIFT/GATE/SCORE) that highlight non-reducibility. A lightweight Python reference library accompanies the schema, implementing canonical hashing and adapters for DPO and RRHF.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Incremental learning remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as models often struggle with catastrophic forgetting -the tendency to lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new information. These challenges are even more pronounced in resource-limited settings. Many existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually adapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial computational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work introduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach that addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable solution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several existing, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature extractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer neural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor eliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone. This, combined with a compressed buffer for efficient memory use, enables CIFNet to perform efficient class-incremental learning through a single-step optimization process on fixed features, minimizing computational overhead and training time without requiring multiple weight updates. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that CIFNet effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting at the classifier level, achieving high accuracy comparable to that of existing state-of-the-art methods, while substantially improving training efficiency and sustainability. CIFNet represents a significant advancement in making class-incremental learning more accessible and pragmatic in environments with limited resources, especially when strong pre-trained feature extractors are available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gradient based optimization is fundamental to most modern deep reinforcement learning algorithms, however, it introduces significant sensitivity to hyperparameters, unstable training dynamics, and high computational costs. We propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass, without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top 5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a surprising generalization capacity. We further formalize the intrinsic context size limit of in context RL algorithms and propose principled truncation strategies that enable continual learning when the context is full. Our results establish prior fitted networks such as TabPFN as a viable foundation for fast and computationally efficient RL, opening new directions for gradient free RL with large pre trained transformers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present TransZero, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that removes the sequential bottleneck in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Unlike MuZero, which constructs its search tree step by step using a recurrent dynamics model, TransZero employs a transformer-based network to generate multiple latent future states simultaneously. Combined with the Mean-Variance Constrained (MVC) evaluator that eliminates dependence on inherently sequential visitation counts, our approach enables the parallel expansion of entire subtrees during planning. Experiments in MiniGrid and LunarLander show that TransZero achieves up to an eleven-fold speedup in wall-clock time compared to MuZero while maintaining sample efficiency. These results demonstrate that parallel tree construction can substantially accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, bringing real-time decision-making in complex environments closer to practice. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

  Federated Learning (FL) is gaining prominence in machine learning as privacy concerns grow. This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data, despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions. FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model merging is an effective post-training strategy for composing capabilities in large language models without joint retraining. We study this in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, where multiple capability-based SFT checkpoints -- spanning math, code, precise instruction following, general instruction following, and knowledge recall -- must be consolidated into a single model. We introduce Optimization Trajectory Aware (OTA) Merging, a curvature-aware aggregation that leverages optimizer second-moment statistics as a diagonal curvature proxy to reweight parameter edits and mitigate interference. Complementing OTA, we propose Fast Fisher Grafting (FFG), a curvature-driven task-localization step that sparsifies conflicting or low-importance edits. FFG induces extremely low-rank masks concentrated in early attention query/key projections and token embeddings, exploiting shared curvature across capabilities. We further develop a memory-light compression of the second moments that preserves OTA's effect. Across diverse capability-based SFT checkpoints, OTA+FFG improves merged-model quality over strong weight-space baselines, reduces negative transfer, and remains robust across sparsity levels. Analyses reveal substantial curvature overlap between checkpoints, offering a novel lens on why simple linear merging can be effective in practice. Ablations confirm that FFG is critical for reducing task interference and that the compressed second moments retain the gains of the full formulation. To facilitate reproducibility, we open-source all code, training and evaluation scripts, visualization artifacts, and capability-specific SFT checkpoints atthis https URL.

  _Mahabubur Rahman Miraj, Hongyu Huang, Ting Yang, Jinxue Zhao, Nankun Mu, Xinyu Lei_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imbalanced classification is a significant challenge in machine learning, especially in critical applications like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Traditional oversampling techniques, such as SMOTE, often fail to handle label noise and complex data distributions, leading to reduced classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose GK-SMOTE, a hyperparameter-free, noise-resilient extension of SMOTE, built on Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). GK-SMOTE enhances class separability by generating synthetic samples in high-density minority regions, while effectively avoiding noisy or ambiguous areas. This self-adaptive approach uses Gaussian KDE to differentiate between safe and noisy regions, ensuring more accurate sample generation without requiring extensive parameter tuning. Our extensive experiments on diverse binary classification datasets demonstrate that GK-SMOTE outperforms existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques across key evaluation metrics, including MCC, Balanced Accuracy, and AUPRC. The proposed method offers a robust, efficient solution for imbalanced classification tasks, especially in noisy data environments, making it an attractive choice for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Model extraction is a severe threat to Machine Learning-as-a-Service systems, especially through data-free approaches, where dishonest users can replicate the functionality of a black-box target model without access to realistic data. Despite recent advancements, existing data-free model extraction methods suffer from the oscillating accuracy of the substitute model. This oscillation, which could be attributed to the constant shift in the generated data distribution during the attack, makes the attack impractical since the optimal substitute model cannot be determined without access to the target model's in-distribution data. Hence, we propose MetaDFME, a novel data-free model extraction method that employs meta-learning in the generator training to reduce the distribution shift, aiming to mitigate the substitute model's accuracy oscillation. In detail, we train our generator to iteratively capture the meta-representations of the synthetic data during the attack. These meta-representations can be adapted with a few steps to produce data that facilitates the substitute model to learn from the target model while reducing the effect of distribution shifts. Our experiments on popular baseline image datasets, MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that MetaDFME outperforms the current state-of-the-art data-free model extraction method while exhibiting a more stable substitute model's accuracy during the attack.

  _Santhosh G S, Saurav Prakash, Balaraman Ravindran_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental barrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a critical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we introduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile approximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a graceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient offline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix via SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project query and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions based on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of AQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more computationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in the attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically insignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We further showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to synergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to directly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to balance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool for making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Feature space topology refers to the organization of samples within the feature space. Modifying this topology can be beneficial in machine learning applications, including dimensionality reduction, generative modeling, transfer learning, and robustness to adversarial attacks. This paper introduces a novel loss function, Hopkins loss, which leverages the Hopkins statistic to enforce a desired feature space topology, which is in contrast to existing topology-related methods that aim to preserve input feature topology. We evaluate the effectiveness of Hopkins loss on speech, text, and image data in two scenarios: classification and dimensionality reduction using nonlinear bottleneck autoencoders. Our experiments show that integrating Hopkins loss into classification or dimensionality reduction has only a small impact on classification performance while providing the benefit of modifying feature topology.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in civil engineering, but they primarily focus on textual and visual data, overlooking the rich semantic, spatial, and topological features in BIM (Building Information Modelling) models. Therefore, this study develops the first large-scale graph neural network (GNN), BIGNet, to learn, and reuse multidimensional design features embedded in BIM models. Firstly, a scalable graph representation is introduced to encode the "semantic-spatial-topological" features of BIM components, and a dataset with nearly 1 million nodes and 3.5 million edges is created. Subsequently, BIGNet is proposed by introducing a new message-passing mechanism to GraphMAE2 and further pretrained with a node masking strategy. Finally, BIGNet is evaluated in various transfer learning tasks for BIM-based design checking. Results show that: 1) homogeneous graph representation outperforms heterogeneous graph in learning design features, 2) considering local spatial relationships in a 30 cm radius enhances performance, and 3) BIGNet with GAT (Graph Attention Network)-based feature extraction achieves the best transfer learning results. This innovation leads to a 72.7% improvement in Average F1-score over non-pretrained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning and transferring BIM design features and facilitating their automated application in future design and lifecycle management.

  _Khoa Tran, Pranav Gupta, Manos Papagelis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to associate anonymized trajectories with the users who generated them, which is crucial for personalized recommendations, privacy-preserving analytics, and secure location-based services. Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.

  Audio-based equipment condition monitoring suffers from a lack of standardized methodologies for algorithm selection, hindering reproducible research. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive framework for the systematic and statistically rigorous evaluation of machine learning models. Leveraging a rich 127-feature set across time, frequency, and time-frequency domains, our methodology is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that an ensemble method achieves superior performance (94.2% accuracy, 0.942 F1-score), with statistical testing confirming its significant outperformance of individual algorithms by 8-15%. Ultimately, this work provides a validated benchmarking protocol and practical guidelines for selecting robust monitoring solutions in industrial settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Although numerical weather forecasting methods have dominated the field, recent advances in deep learning methods, such as diffusion models, have shown promise in ensemble weather forecasting. However, such models are typically autoregressive and are thus computationally expensive. This is a challenge in climate science, where data can be limited, costly, or difficult to work with. In this work, we explore the impact of curated data selection on these autoregressive diffusion models. We evaluate several data sampling strategies and show that a simple time stratified sampling approach achieves performance similar to or better than full-data training. Notably, it outperforms the full-data model on certain metrics and performs only slightly worse on others while using only 20% of the training data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of data-efficient diffusion training, especially for weather forecasting, and motivates future work on adaptive or model-aware sampling methods that go beyond random or purely temporal sampling.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Gradient descent typically converges to a single minimum of the training loss without mechanisms to explore alternative minima that may generalize better. Searching for diverse minima directly in high-dimensional parameter space is generally intractable. To address this, we propose a framework that performs training in two distinct phases: search in a tractable representation space (the space of intermediate activations) to find diverse representational solutions, and gradient-based learning in parameter space by regressing to those searched representations. Through evolutionary search, we discover representational solutions whose fitness and diversity scale with compute--larger populations and more generations produce better and more varied solutions. These representations prove to be learnable: networks trained by regressing to searched representations approach SGD's performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Performance improves with search compute up to saturation. The resulting models differ qualitatively from networks trained with gradient descent, following different representational trajectories during training. This work demonstrates how future training algorithms could overcome gradient descent's exploratory limitations by decoupling search in representation space from efficient gradient-based learning in parameter space.

  _Bhoomit Vasani, Jack FitzGerald, Anjie Fang, Sushmit Vaish_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce PHLoRA (Pronounced "flora"). (Post-hoc LoRA), a simple yet powerful method to extract low-rank adaptation adapters from full-rank fine-tuned models without requiring access to training data or gradients. By computing the low-rank decomposition of weight differences between a base model and its fine-tuned counterpart, our method reconstructs adapter modules that can be merged or dynamically routed at inference time via S-LoRA, or served in scalable, industry settings using platforms like NVIDIA NIM. This approach amortizes latency overhead across requests and yields substantial cost savings. Unlike prior work that trains each adapter explicitly, our approach decouples fine-tuning from adapter generation, allowing adapter extraction from existing full-rank models or third-party checkpoints. Experiments on text, image, and video benchmarks using the Amazon Nova model family demonstrate that extracted adapters preserve high energy from the full weight delta, can be pruned safely, and yield negligible degradation in downstream task performance when re-merged. Overall, PHLoRA provides a practical path for making all existing full-rank checkpoints adapter-ready, democratizing scalable inference for all models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Emerging reports of "AI psychosis" are on the rise, where user-LLM interactions may exacerbate or induce psychosis or adverse psychological symptoms. The sycophantic and agreeable nature of LLMs can beneficial, it can become a vector for harm by reinforcing delusional beliefs in vulnerable users.Methods: We introduce psychosis-bench, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the psychogenicity of LLMs comprimising 16 structured, 12-turn conversational scenarios simulating the progression of delusional themes(Erotic Delusions, Grandiose/Messianic Delusions, Referential Delusions) and potential harms. We evaluated eight prominent LLMs for Delusion Confirmation (DCS), Harm Enablement (HES), and Safety Intervention(SIS) across explicit and implicit conversational contexts.Findings: Across 1,536 simulated conversation turns, all LLMs demonstrated psychogenic potential, showing a strong tendency to perpetuate rather than challenge delusions (mean DCS of 0.91 $\pm$0.88). Models frequently enabled harmful user requests (mean HES of 0.69 $\pm$0.84) and offered safety interventions in only roughly a third of applicable turns (mean SIS of 0.37 $\pm$0.48). 51 / 128 (39.8%) of scenarios had no safety interventions offered. Performance was significantly worse in implicit scenarios, models were more likely to confirm delusions and enable harm while offering fewer interventions (p < .001). A strong correlation was found between DCS and HES (rs = .77). Model performance varied widely, indicating that safety is not an emergent property of scale alone.Conclusion: This study establishes LLM psychogenicity as a quantifiable risk and underscores the urgent need for re-thinking how we train LLMs. We frame this issue not merely as a technical challenge but as a public health imperative requiring collaboration between developers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

  _Mitali Raj_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The impressive capabilities of deep learning models are often counterbalanced by their inherent opacity, commonly termed the "black box" problem, which impedes their widespread acceptance in high-trust domains. In response, the intersecting disciplines of interpretability and explainability, collectively falling under the Explainable AI (XAI) umbrella, have become focal points of research. Although these terms are frequently used as synonyms, they carry distinct conceptual weights. This document offers a comparative exploration of interpretability and explainability within the deep learning paradigm, carefully outlining their respective definitions, objectives, prevalent methodologies, and inherent difficulties. Through illustrative examinations of the MNIST digit classification task and IMDB sentiment analysis, we substantiate a key argument: interpretability generally pertains to a model's inherent capacity for human comprehension of its operational mechanisms (global understanding), whereas explainability is more commonly associated with post-hoc techniques designed to illuminate the basis for a model's individual predictions or behaviors (local explanations). For example, feature attribution methods can reveal why a specific MNIST image is recognized as a '7', and word-level importance can clarify an IMDB sentiment outcome. However, these local insights do not render the complex underlying model globally transparent. A clear grasp of this differentiation, as demonstrated by these standard datasets, is vital for fostering dependable and sound artificial intelligence.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion models excel in high-fidelity image generation but face scalability limits due to transformers' quadratic attention complexity. Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Randomized smoothing is a well-established method for achieving certified robustness against l2-adversarial perturbations. By incorporating a denoiser before the base classifier, pretrained classifiers can be seamlessly integrated into randomized smoothing without significant performance degradation. Among existing methods, Diffusion Denoised Smoothing - where a pretrained denoising diffusion model serves as the denoiser - has produced state-of-the-art results. However, we show that employing a denoising diffusion model introduces a covariate shift via misestimation of the added noise, ultimately degrading the smoothed classifier's performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel adversarial objective function focused on the added noise of the denoising diffusion model. This approach is inspired by our understanding of the origin of the covariate shift. Our goal is to train the base classifier to ensure it is robust against the covariate shift introduced by the denoiser. Our method significantly improves certified accuracy across three standard classification benchmarks - MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet - achieving new state-of-the-art performance in l2-adversarial perturbations.

  _Mingkang Li, Xuexiong Luo, Yue Zhang, Yaoyang Li, Fu Lin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is an inherently challenging problem, as it requires the identification of rare nodes that deviate from the majority in both their structural and behavioral characteristics. Existing methods, such as those based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), often suffer from over-smoothing, which causes the learned node representations to become indistinguishable. Furthermore, graph reconstruction-based approaches are vulnerable to anomalous node interference during the reconstruction process, leading to inaccurate anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a novel and holistic anomaly evaluation framework that integrates three key components: a local-global Transformer encoder, a memory-guided reconstruction mechanism, and a multi-scale representation matching strategy. These components work synergistically to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global structural dependencies, suppress the influence of anomalous nodes, and assess anomalies from multiple levels of granularity. Anomaly scores are computed by combining reconstruction errors and memory matching signals, resulting in a more robust evaluation. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a comprehensive and generalizable solution for anomaly detection across various graph domains.

  Generative learning has advanced network neuroscience, enabling tasks like graph super-resolution, temporal graph prediction, and multimodal brain graph fusion. However, current methods, mainly based on graph neural networks (GNNs), focus solely on structural and topological properties, neglecting cognitive traits. To address this, we introduce the first cognified generative model, CogGNN, which endows GNNs with cognitive capabilities (e.g., visual memory) to generate brain networks that preserve cognitive features. While broadly applicable, we present CogGNN, a specific variant designed to integrate visual input, a key factor in brain functions like pattern recognition and memory recall. As a proof of concept, we use our model to learn connectional brain templates (CBTs), population-level fingerprints from multi-view brain networks. Unlike prior work that overlooks cognitive properties, CogGNN generates CBTs that are both cognitively and structurally meaningful. Our contributions are: (i) a novel cognition-aware generative model with a visual-memory-based loss; (ii) a CBT-learning framework with a co-optimization strategy to yield well-centered, discriminative, cognitively enhanced templates. Extensive experiments show that CogGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a strong foundation for cognitively grounded brain network modeling.

  Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our Selection and Projection framework, termed S\&P TopK, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness metrics by a factor of up to 3.2 and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by a factor of up to 1.8 while maintaining downstream performance.

  Transformers have become the foundation for a wide range of state--of--the--art models across natural language processing, computer vision, and other machine learning domains. Despite their widespread deployment, the robustness of these models under fault conditions remains underexplored. We present GoldenTransformer, a modular and extensible fault injection framework designed to evaluate the resiliency of Large Language Models to induced hardware faults. GoldenTransformer offers a unified Python-based platform for injecting diverse classes of faults--such as weight corruption, activation injections, and attention--level disruptions--into pretrained transformer--based models. Inspired by the GoldenEye simulator for DNNs, our framework focuses on the unique challenges of working with large transformer architectures, including considerations such as structural complexity, latent dependencies, and nonuniform layer definitions. GoldenTransformer is built atop PyTorch and HuggingFace Transformers, and it supports experiment reproducibility, metric logging, and visualization out of the box. We detail the technical design and use of GoldenTransformer and demonstrate through several example experiments on classification and generation tasks. By enabling controlled injection of faults at multiple logical and structural points in a transformer, GoldenTransformer offers researchers and practitioners a valuable tool for model robustness analysis and for guiding dependable system design in real-world LLM applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, they often produce inaccurate or unreliable content known as hallucinations. This unreliability significantly limits their deployment in high-stakes applications. Thus, there is a growing need for a general-purpose method to detect hallucinations in LLMs. In this work, we introduce HalluField, a novel field-theoretic approach for hallucination detection based on a parametrized variational principle and thermodynamics. Inspired by thermodynamics, HalluField models an LLM's response to a given query and temperature setting as a collection of discrete likelihood token paths, each associated with a corresponding energy and entropy. By analyzing how energy and entropy distributions vary across token paths under changes in temperature and likelihood, HalluField quantifies the semantic stability of a response. Hallucinations are then detected by identifying unstable or erratic behavior in this energy landscape. HalluField is computationally efficient and highly practical: it operates directly on the model's output logits without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary neural networks. Notably, the method is grounded in a principled physical interpretation, drawing analogies to the first law of thermodynamics. Remarkably, by modeling LLM behavior through this physical lens, HalluField achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance across models and datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations, the overall effect size is small across the entire population. Then, the focus naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning framework tailored to matched-pair designs. The proposed design not only reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions. Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity, along with experiments in practical scenarios, demonstrates the efficiency and advantages of the approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models.

  Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present \textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and innovation policy.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning, sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution shifts and limited memory resources.

  Multi-label learning often requires identifying all relevant labels for training instances, but collecting full label annotations is costly and labor-intensive. In many datasets, only a single positive label is annotated per training instance, despite the presence of multiple relevant labels. This setting, known as single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL), presents a significant challenge due to its extreme form of partial supervision. We propose a model-agnostic approach to SPMLL that draws on conformal prediction to produce calibrated set-valued outputs, enabling reliable multi-label predictions at test time. Our method bridges the supervision gap between single-label training and multi-label evaluation without relying on label distribution assumptions. We evaluate our approach on 12 benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing baselines and practical applicability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  For groups of autonomous agents to achieve a particular goal, they must engage in coordination and long-horizon reasoning. However, designing reward functions to elicit such behavior is challenging. In this paper, we study how self-supervised goal-reaching techniques can be leveraged to enable agents to cooperate. The key idea is that, rather than have agents maximize some scalar reward, agents aim to maximize the likelihood of visiting a certain goal. This problem setting enables human users to specify tasks via a single goal state rather than implementing a complex reward function. While the feedback signal is quite sparse, we will demonstrate that self-supervised goal-reaching techniques enable agents to learn from such feedback. On MARL benchmarks, our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches that have access to the same sparse reward signal as our method. While our method has no explicit mechanism for exploration, we observe that self-supervised multi-agent goal-reaching leads to emergent cooperation and exploration in settings where alternative approaches never witness a single successful trial.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold great promise for advanced reasoning at the intersection of text and images, yet they have not fully realized this potential. MLLMs typically integrate an LLM, a vision encoder, and a connector that maps the vision encoder's embeddings into the LLM's text embedding space. Although each component is pretrained on massive datasets with billions of samples, the entire multimodal model is typically trained on only thousands (or a few million) samples, which can result in weak performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these shortcomings, instead of relying on extensive labeled datasets for fine-tuning, we propose a Test-Time Warmup method that adapts the MLLM per test instance by leveraging data from weakly supervised auxiliary tasks. With our approach, we observe a relative performance improvement of 4.03% on MMMU, 5.28% on VQA-Rad, and 1.63% on GQA on the Llama-Vision-Instruct model. Our method demonstrates that 'warming up' before inference can enhance MLLMs' robustness across diverse reasoning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge (TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge, and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models, which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models -- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting, visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks for efficiently fine-tuning AI models, especially on resource-constrained edges. However, in real-world applications, edge users often exhibit task-specific preferences that are difficult to handle with a unified model trained under a closed-world assumption, and the challenge may further increase when there are significant domain shifts between training and deployment. Meanwhile, retraining/fine-tuning models for each user is also impractical due to its cost-intensive nature and privacy concerns over raw data utilization from edges. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-guided LoRA Parameter Generation (SG-LoRA), the first of its kind framework to efficiently produce user-specific LoRA parameters without any additional training on user tasks or access to user-specific data. Concretely, SG-LoRA uses task descriptions as the semantic bridge, measuring their proximity to a set of known expert tasks in a shared embedding space. Based on this semantic guidance, it models the target task's LoRA parameter distribution to generate high-performing parameters for novel tasks. SG-LoRA enables the real-time construction of LoRA models aligned with individual intents by distilling knowledge from prominent LoRA experts and, meanwhile, offering a privacy-preserving solution for personalized model adaptation in a novel zero-shot open-world setting proposed in this work. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging tasks confirm the superior performance and remarkable adaptability of SG-LoRA. Code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The attention mechanism in a Transformer architecture matches key to query based on both content -- the what -- and position in a sequence -- the where. We present an analysis indicating that what and where are entangled in the popular RoPE rotary position embedding. This entanglement can impair performance particularly when decisions require independent matches on these two factors. We propose an improvement to RoPE, which we call Polar Coordinate Position Embeddings or PoPE, that eliminates the what-where confound. PoPE is far superior on a diagnostic task requiring indexing solely by position or by content. On autoregressive sequence modeling in music, genomic, and natural language domains, Transformers using PoPE as the positional encoding scheme outperform baselines using RoPE with respect to evaluation loss (perplexity) and downstream task performance. On language modeling, these gains persist across model scale, from 124M to 774M parameters. Crucially, PoPE shows strong zero-shot length extrapolation capabilities, whereas RoPE's performance degrades significantly on longer sequences at test time without fine tuning or the use of position-interpolation methods.

  Portfolio optimization is essential for balancing risk and return in financial decision-making. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has stood out as a cutting-edge tool for portfolio optimization that learns dynamic asset allocation using trial-and-error interactions. However, most DRL-based methods are restricted to allocating assets within a pre-defined investment universe and overlook exploring new opportunities. This study introduces an investment landscape that integrates exploiting existing assets with exploring new investment opportunities in an extended universe. The proposed approach leverages two DRL agents and dynamically balances these objectives to adapt to evolving markets while enhancing portfolio performance. One agent allocates assets within the existing universe, while another assists in exploring new opportunities in the extended universe. The effciency of the proposed methodology is determined using two real-world market data sets. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the suggested approach against the state-of-the-art portfolio strategies and baseline methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer models based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture have made significant progress in long-sequence modeling, but existing models still have shortcomings in computational efficiency and the ability to capture long-range dependencies, especially in terms of the dynamic adaptability of expert resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive Shared Expert and Grouped Multi-Head Attention Hybrid Model (DASG-MoE) to enhance long-sequence modeling capabilities by integrating three modules. First, we employ the Grouped Multi-Head Attention (GMHA) mechanism to effectively reduce the computational complexity of long sequences. By parallel processing through sequence grouping, local sliding window attention, and feature aggregation, we address long-range dependency issues and the model's lack of generalization for local information. Second, we design a Dual-Scale Shared Expert Structure (DSSE), where shallow experts use lightweight computations to quickly respond to low-dimensional features, while deep experts process high-dimensional complex semantics through pre-training transfer and post-training optimization, achieving a dynamic balance between efficiency and accuracy. Third, we propose a hierarchical Adaptive Dynamic Routing (ADR) mechanism that dynamically selects expert levels based on feature complexity and task requirements, and optimizes resource allocation through a local expert activation strategy. Experiments on multiple long-sequence benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DASG-MoE model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

  _Aoi Otani_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual learning -- the ability to acquire knowledge incrementally without forgetting previous skills -- is fundamental to natural intelligence. While the human brain excels at this, artificial neural networks struggle with "catastrophic forgetting," where learning new tasks erases previously acquired knowledge. This challenge is particularly severe for text-to-image diffusion models, which generate images from textual prompts. Additionally, these models face "mode collapse," where their outputs become increasingly repetitive over time. To address these challenges, we apply Latent Replay, a neuroscience-inspired approach, to diffusion models. Traditional replay methods mitigate forgetting by storing and revisiting past examples, typically requiring large collections of images. Latent Replay instead retains only compact, high-level feature representations extracted from the model's internal architecture. This mirrors the hippocampal process of storing neural activity patterns rather than raw sensory inputs, reducing memory usage while preserving critical information. Through experiments with five sequentially learned visual concepts, we demonstrate that Latent Replay significantly outperforms existing methods in maintaining model versatility. After learning all concepts, our approach retained 77.59% Image Alignment (IA) on the earliest concept, 14% higher than baseline methods, while maintaining diverse outputs. Surprisingly, random selection of stored latent examples outperforms similarity-based strategies. Our findings suggest that Latent Replay enables efficient continual learning for generative AI models, paving the way for personalized text-to-image models that evolve with user needs without excessive computational costs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel approach to neural network pruning by integrating a graph-based observation space into an AutoML framework to address the limitations of existing methods. Traditional pruning approaches often depend on hand-crafted heuristics and local optimization perspectives, which can lead to suboptimal performance and inefficient pruning strategies. Our framework transforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the target neural network that captures complete topological relationships between layers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a global view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph Attention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph representation and generates a rich embedding. Additionally, for the action space we transition from continuous pruning ratios to fine-grained binary action spaces which enables the agent to learn optimal channel importance criteria directly from data, moving away from predefined scoring functions. These contributions are modelled within a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) framework, allowing the agent to make informed pruning decisions while adhering to resource constraints such as target compression rates. For this, we design a self-competition reward system that encourages the agent to outperform its previous best performance while satisfying the defined constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. The experiments show that our method consistently outperforms traditional pruning techniques, showing state-of-the-art results while learning task-specific pruning strategies that identify functionally redundant connections beyond simple weight magnitude considerations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by atypical brain maturation. However, the adaptation of transfer learning paradigms in machine learning for ASD research remains notably limited. In this study, we propose a computer-aided diagnostic framework with two modules. This chapter presents a two-module framework combining deep learning and explainable AI for ASD diagnosis. The first module leverages a deep learning model fine-tuned through cross-domain transfer learning for ASD classification. The second module focuses on interpreting the model decisions and identifying critical brain regions. To achieve this, we employed three explainable AI (XAI) techniques: saliency mapping, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. This framework demonstrates that cross-domain transfer learning can effectively address data scarcity in ASD research. In addition, by applying three established explainability techniques, the approach reveals how the model makes diagnostic decisions and identifies brain regions most associated with ASD. These findings were compared against established neurobiological evidence, highlighting strong alignment and reinforcing the clinical relevance of the proposed approach.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Personalized federated learning (PFL) often fails under label skew and non-stationarity because a single global parameterization ignores client-specific geometry. We introduce VGM$^2$ (Variational Gaussian Mixture Manifold), a geometry-centric PFL framework that (i) learns client-specific parametric UMAP embeddings, (ii) models latent pairwise distances with mixture relation markers for same and different class pairs, and (iii) exchanges only variational, uncertainty-aware marker statistics. Each client maintains a Dirichlet-Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Dir-NIG) posterior over marker weights, means, and variances; the server aggregates via conjugate moment matching to form global priors that guide subsequent rounds. We prove that this aggregation minimizes the summed reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence from client posteriors within the conjugate family, yielding stability under heterogeneity. We further incorporate a calibration term for distance-to-similarity mapping and report communication and compute budgets. Across eight vision datasets with non-IID label shards, VGM$^2$ achieves competitive or superior test F1 scores compared to strong baselines while communicating only small geometry summaries. Privacy is strengthened through secure aggregation and optional differential privacy noise, and we provide a membership-inference stress test. Code and configurations will be released to ensure full reproducibility.

  In production systems, contextual bandit approaches often rely on direct reward models that take both action and context as input. However, these models can suffer from confounding, making it difficult to isolate the effect of the action from that of the context.

The method is theoretically grounded and consistently outperforms direct models in both synthetic experiments and real-world deployments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Approximate multipliers (AppMults) are widely used in deep learning accelerators to reduce their area, delay, and power consumption. However, AppMults introduce arithmetic errors into deep learning models, necessitating a retraining process to recover accuracy. A key step in retraining is computing the gradient of the AppMult, i.e., the partial derivative of the approximate product with respect to each input operand. Existing approaches typically estimate this gradient using that of the accurate multiplier (AccMult), which can lead to suboptimal retraining results. To address this, we propose two methods to obtain more precise gradients of AppMults. The first, called LUT-2D, characterizes the AppMult gradient with 2-dimensional lookup tables (LUTs), providing fine-grained estimation and achieving the highest retraining accuracy. The second, called LUT-1D, is a compact and more efficient variant that stores gradient values in 1-dimensional LUTs, achieving comparable retraining accuracy with shorter runtime. Experimental results show that on CIFAR-10 with convolutional neural networks, our LUT-2D and LUT-1D methods improve retraining accuracy by 3.83% and 3.72% on average, respectively. On ImageNet with vision transformer models, our LUT-1D method improves retraining accuracy by 23.69% on average, compared to a state-of-the-art retraining framework.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Holographic Knowledge Manifold (HKM), a four-phase pipeline that achieves zero catastrophic forgetting in AI knowledge representation while maintaining minimal memory growth and high efficiency. Leveraging fractal quantization, probabilistic entanglement, and dynamic diffraction chipping, HKM compresses knowledge substrates by 3x with 67% storage savings, integrates holographically at 100%, and supports over 1,020 updates with 1% growth per increment. In experiments on combined WikiText and FB15k datasets (scaled to 2,997 nodes), we demonstrate industry-leading performance: 0% forgetting (infinite improvement over GEM baselines), 3x compression, and 53% training time reduction on consumer GPU hardware. Hypothetical cost analyses project $92.4M savings over 5 years at petabyte scale, with 21.2% energy reduction and 33% lower carbon footprint. This work hypothesizes a paradigm shift for public large language models (LLMs), enabling "eternal" adaptation without retraining. Future extensions to multimodal fusion and quantum hardware could further democratize scalable AI, potentially reducing fine-tuning costs by 60-80% for models like Llama-3 or Grok-4. Code, datasets, and full results are publicly available for reproducibility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Offline preference optimization methods are efficient for large language models (LLMs) alignment. Direct Preference optimization (DPO)-like learning, one of the most popular approaches, stands out for its efficiency in reward modeling. However, these methods typically follow the convention to use Bradley-Terry (BT) reward modeling that faces several critical assumptions, including the requirement for pairwise training data, model distribution shifting, human rationality assumption, etc. To address these limitations, we propose a general framework for offline preference optimization methods, Adaptive Preference Optimization with Utility Anchor (UAPO), which introduces an anchoring function to estimate the uncertainties brought from preference data annotation. Our method enables training even in scenarios where the data is unpaired, significantly enhancing data utilization efficiency. Moreover, the anchor design makes UAPO more robust in the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that UAPO achieves competitive outcomes without the strict dependency on data pairing, paving the way for more flexible and effective preference optimization methods.

  Continuous attractors are critical for information processing in both biological and artificial neural systems, with implications for spatial navigation, memory, and deep learning optimization. However, existing research lacks a unified framework to analyze their properties across diverse dynamical systems, limiting cross-architectural generalizability. This study establishes a novel framework from the perspective of differential manifolds to investigate continuous attractors in artificial neural networks. It verifies compatibility with prior conclusions, elucidates links between continuous attractor phenomena and eigenvalues of the local Jacobian matrix, and demonstrates the universality of singular value stratification in common classification models and datasets. These findings suggest continuous attractors may be ubiquitous in general neural networks, highlighting the need for a general theory, with the proposed framework offering a promising foundation given the close mathematical connection between eigenvalues and singular values.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a highly scalable solution by conditionally activating sub-modules without a proportional increase in computational costs. However, improving expert specialization to enhance performance and generalization remains a challenge for MoE, especially in instruction tuning scenarios characterized by significant input heterogeneity. In this work, we propose the Mixture-of-Clustered-Experts (MoCE) to address this limitation through a dual-stage routing mechanism. The first stage in the mechanism performs expert group routing based on sequence-level features, while the second stage activates the top-$k$ experts within the group at the token level. This approach enables the effective partitioning of heterogeneous inputs based on their knowledge requirements, encouraging expert group specialization while maintaining the advantages of token-level routing. We evaluate MoCE across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, demonstrating its consistent superiority over strong baselines and its enhanced generalization capabilities. Detailed analysis further highlights the robustness and effectiveness of MoCE.

  _Sai Teja Reddy Adapala_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The stability of recursively trained large language models (LLMs) is a foundational problem for AI safety. Prevailing theory predicts model collapse, a progressive degradation when models are trained on their own output. We challenge this narrative by introducing a selective feedback mechanism. Contrary to expectation, instead of merely slowing decay, our experiments provide strong evidence that this pressure reverses it, inducing a statistically significant performance improvement in a Gemma 2B model on a complex summarization task. We name this phenomenon the Anti-Ouroboros Effect. We contrast this with a foundational experiment using a simple classifier, where the theoretical degenerative loop was validated, highlighting the unique dynamics of high-dimensional models. Our findings establish that systemic resilience can be an emergent property of LLMs under simple selection pressure, suggesting a powerful and scalable principle for developing safer and more robust AI systems. Across five generations, a quality-filtered condition improved by 6.6% in ROUGE-L F1 score, whereas an unfiltered control degraded by 3.5% and a random-filter control degraded by 4.2%

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Object Detection (FOD) enables clients to collaboratively train a global object detection model without accessing their local data from diverse domains. However, significant variations in environment, weather, and other domain specific factors hinder performance, making cross domain generalization a key challenge. Existing FOD methods often overlook the hardware constraints of edge devices and introduce local training regularizations that incur high computational costs, limiting real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose FEDEXCHANGE, a novel FOD framework that bridges domain gaps without introducing additional local computational overhead. FEDEXCHANGE employs a server side dynamic model exchange strategy that enables each client to gain insights from other clients' domain data without direct data sharing. Specifically, FEDEXCHANGE allows the server to alternate between model aggregation and model exchange. During aggregation rounds, the server aggregates all local models as usual. In exchange rounds, FEDEXCHANGE clusters and exchanges local models based on distance measures, allowing local models to learn from a variety of domains. As all operations are performed on the server side, clients can achieve improved cross domain utility without any additional computational overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FEDEXCHANGE enhances FOD performance, achieving 1.6X better mean average precision in challenging domains, such as rainy conditions, while requiring only 0.8X the computational resources compared to baseline methods.

  _Wentao Gao, Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Thuc Duy Le, Xiongren Chen, Xiaojing Du, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-inflated data pose significant challenges in precipitation forecasting due to the predominance of zeros with sparse non-zero events. To address this, we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions, Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\% reduction in MSE and 21.1\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge.

  Accurate and reliable State Of Health (SOH) estimation for Lithium (Li) batteries is critical to ensure the longevity, safety, and optimal performance of applications like electric vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, consumer electronics, and renewable energy storage systems. Conventional SOH estimation techniques fail to represent the non-linear and temporal aspects of battery degradation effectively. In this study, we propose a novel SOH prediction framework (SOH-KLSTM) using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-Integrated Candidate Cell State in LSTM for Li batteries Health Monitoring. This hybrid approach combines the ability of LSTM to learn long-term dependencies for accurate time series predictions with KAN's non-linear approximation capabilities to effectively capture complex degradation behaviors in Lithium batteries.

  _Rupert Mitchell, Kristian Kersting_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Multipole Semantic Attention (MuSe), an efficient approximation of softmax attention that combines semantic clustering with multipole expansions from computational physics. Our method addresses the quadratic computational complexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys separately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical two-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group only keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that respect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment centroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture directional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during training. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention, requiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural modifications. Our approach achieves $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal attention with $C$ clusters and $\mathcal{O}(NCD \log N)$ for causal attention. On isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash Attention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For causal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines exact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end pretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we achieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing the viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer pretraining.

  The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs; Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) - (1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale. Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g. automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11 participants (mean age: 24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D√§twyler SoftPulse) as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep) using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks: false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and ECG signals.

  Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms latency.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.Code -this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results.

  Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability.We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.

  Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase. The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural development and accelerate the design cycle.

  As single-center computing approaches power constraints, decentralized training is becoming essential. Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.

  Adversarial examples -- inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool neural networks -- remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One underexplored hypothesis is that superposition, a concept from mechanistic interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models, intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition, and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition.

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks, such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore, CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14% AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods under limited-label settings.

  Pretrained neural networks have attracted significant interest in chemistry and small molecule drug design. Embeddings from these models are widely used for molecular property prediction, virtual screening, and small data learning in molecular chemistry. This study presents the most extensive comparison of such models to date, evaluating 25 models across 25 datasets. Under a fair comparison framework, we assess models spanning various modalities, architectures, and pretraining strategies. Using a dedicated hierarchical Bayesian statistical testing model, we arrive at a surprising result: nearly all neural models show negligible or no improvement over the baseline ECFP molecular fingerprint. Only the CLAMP model, which is also based on molecular fingerprints, performs statistically significantly better than the alternatives. These findings raise concerns about the evaluation rigor in existing studies. We discuss potential causes, propose solutions, and offer practical recommendations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physics-Informed Neural Networks offer a powerful framework for solving PDEs by embedding physical laws into the learning process. However, when applied to domains with irregular boundaries, PINNs often suffer from instability and slow convergence, which stems from (1) inconsistent normalization due to geometric anisotropy, (2) inaccurate boundary enforcements, and (3) imbalanced loss term competition. A common workaround is to map the domain to a regular space. Yet, conventional mapping methods rely on case-specific meshes, define Jacobians at pre-specified fixed nodes, reformulate PDEs via the chain rule-making them incompatible with modern automatic differentiation, tensor-based frameworks. To bridge this gap, we propose JacobiNet, a learning-based coordinate-transformed PINN framework that unifies domain mapping and PDE solving within an end-to-end differentiable architecture. Leveraging lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet learns continuous, differentiable mappings, enables direct Jacobian computation via autograd, shares computation graph with downstream PINNs. Its continuous nature and built-in Jacobian eliminate the need for meshing, explicit Jacobians computation/ storage, and PDE reformulation, while unlocking geometric-editing operations, reducing the mapping cost. Separating physical modeling from geometric complexity, JacobiNet (1) addresses normalization challenges in the original anisotropic coordinates, (2) facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions, and (3) mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. Evaluated on various PDEs, JacobiNet reduces the L2 error from 0.11-0.73 to 0.01-0.09. In vessel-like domains with varying shapes, JacobiNet enables millisecond-level mapping inference for unseen geometries, improves prediction accuracy by an average of 3.65*, while delivering over 10* speed up-demonstrating strong generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

  _Prital Bamnodkar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as catastrophic forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice, and Spaced Repetition, named Task-Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay framework with a mechanism we term the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and the Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to Standard Experience Replay's 7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally, we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

  _Yoon Pyo Lee_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. While existing approaches for aggregating client-specific classification heads and adapted backbone parameters require architectural modifications or loss function changes, our method uniquely leverages intrinsic training signals already available during standard optimization. We present LIVAR (Layer Importance and VARiance-based merging), which introduces: i) a variance-weighted classifier aggregation scheme using naturally emergent feature statistics, and ii) an explainability-driven LoRA merging technique based on SHAP analysis of existing update parameter patterns. Without any architectural overhead, LIVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while maintaining seamless integration with existing FL methods. This work demonstrates that effective model merging can be achieved solely through existing training signals, establishing a new paradigm for efficient federated model aggregation.

  _Cooper Doyle_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA adapt large language models by inserting low-rank adapters, but they leave open two key questions: how to give the adapted model calibrated uncertainty, and how to choose the adapter rank. Existing approaches to uncertainty are typically post-hoc, while rank selection is manual and task-specific. BayesLoRA revisits variational dropout in the LoRA setting and shows that the natural unit of stochasticity is not individual weights but entire ranks of the adapter. By placing rank-wise variational distributions over adapter components, BayesLoRA defines a posterior that (i) yields calibrated predictions through adapter-only Monte Carlo sampling and (ii) prunes redundant ranks automatically via an ARD-style KL term. Theoretical analysis shows that this rank-parameterized posterior localizes uncertainty to the adapted subspace and explains amplification under distribution shift. Empirically, BayesLoRA improves calibration while at the same time producing lighter, faster adapters, removing the need to tune ranks by hand. This dual role of uncertainty estimation and uncertainty-driven pruning suggests BayesLoRA may offer a practical default for reliable and efficient PEFT.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.

  Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page:this http URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Effective surrogate models are critical for accelerating scientific simulations. Implicit neural representations (INRs) offer a compact and continuous framework for modeling spatially structured data, but they often struggle with complex scientific fields exhibiting localized, high-frequency variations. Recent approaches address this by introducing additional features along rigid geometric structures (e.g., grids), but at the cost of flexibility and increased model size. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective alternative: Feature-Adaptive INR (FA-INR). FA-INR leverages cross-attention to an augmented memory bank to learn flexible feature representations, enabling adaptive allocation of model capacity based on data characteristics, rather than rigid structural assumptions. To further improve scalability, we introduce a coordinate-guided mixture of experts (MoE) that enhances the specialization and efficiency of feature representations. Experiments on three large-scale ensemble simulation datasets show that FA-INR achieves state-of-the-art fidelity while significantly reducing model size, establishing a new trade-off frontier between accuracy and compactness for INR-based surrogates.

  _Wuhao Wang, Zhiyong Chen_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) remain a core challenge in reinforcement learning due to incomplete state information. We address this by reformulating POMDPs as fully observable processes with fixed-length observation histories as augmented states. To efficiently encode these histories, we propose a lightweight temporal encoder based on depthwise separable convolution and self-attention, avoiding the overhead of recurrent and Transformer-based models. Integrated into an actor-critic framework, our method achieves superior performance on continuous control benchmarks under partial observability. More broadly, this work shows that lightweight temporal encoding can improve the scalability of AI systems under uncertainty. It advances the development of agents capable of reasoning robustly in real-world environments where information is incomplete or delayed.

  While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse graph-related tasks, their high-dimensional hidden representations render them black boxes. In this work, we propose Graph Lingual Network (GLN), a GNN built on large language models (LLMs), with hidden representations in the form of human-readable text. Through careful prompt design, GLN incorporates not only the message passing module of GNNs but also advanced GNN techniques, including graph attention and initial residual connection. The comprehensibility of GLN's hidden representations enables an intuitive analysis of how node representations change (1) across layers and (2) under advanced GNN techniques, shedding light on the inner workings of GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GLN achieves strong zero-shot performance on node classification and link prediction, outperforming existing LLM-based baseline methods.

  While diffusion models have revolutionized text-to-image generation with their ability to synthesize realistic and diverse scenes, they continue to struggle to generate consistent and legible text within images. This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling. We release our entire evaluation pipeline atthis https URL.

  _Sidharth S. Menon, Ameya D. Jagtap_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.

- **[Convergence Analysis of Asynchronous Federated Learning with Gradient Compression for Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19903)**  `arXiv:2504.19903`  
  _Diying Yang, Yingwei Hou, Weigang Wu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In practical federated learning (FL), the large communication overhead between clients and the server is often a significant bottleneck. Gradient compression methods can effectively reduce this overhead, while error feedback (EF) restores model accuracy. Moreover, due to device heterogeneity, synchronous FL often suffers from stragglers and inefficiency-issues that asynchronous FL effectively alleviates. However, in asynchronous FL settings-which inherently face three major challenges: asynchronous delay, data heterogeneity, and flexible client participation-the complex interactions among these system/statistical constraints and compression/EF mechanisms remain poorly understood theoretically. In this paper, we fill this gap through a comprehensive convergence study that adequately decouples and unravels these complex interactions across various FL frameworks. We first consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and establish an improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a superior convergence rate than prior studies. We then extend our study to a compressed version, AsynFLC, and derive sufficient conditions for its convergence, indicating the nonlinear interaction between asynchronous delay and compression rate. Our analysis further demonstrates how asynchronous delay and data heterogeneity jointly exacerbate compression-induced errors, thereby hindering convergence. Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further integrates EF. We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient estimation under the aforementioned challenges, enabling AsynFLC-EF to match the convergence rate of AsynFL. We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay and flexible participation on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term. Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well.

  As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. In this work, we present a data-centric pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our framework consists of four key steps: (i) Safety Filtering: building a safety classifier to classify webdata into safe and unsafe categories; (ii) Safety Rephrasing: we recontextualize unsafe webdata into safer narratives; (iii) Native Refusal: we develop RefuseWeb and Moral Education pretraining datasets that actively teach model to refuse on unsafe content and the moral reasoning behind it, and (iv) Harmfulness-Tag annotated pretraining: we flag unsafe content during pretraining using a special token, and use it to steer model away from unsafe generations at inference. Our safety-pretrained models reduce attack success rates from 38.8\% to 8.4\% on standard LLM safety benchmarks with no performance degradation on general tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT) and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index and Forex pairs such as XAUUSD and EURUSD. We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to manage risk effectively. We trained and tested data on a 3 month dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Our bot based on Permutation Decision Tree achieved a profit of 1.1802\% over the testing period, where as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.557\% over the testing period and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.5896\% over the testing period. All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss of 2.29\%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  An important objective in computational biology is the efficient integration of multi-omics data. The task of integration comes with challenges: multi-omics data are most often unpaired (requiring diagonal integration), partially labeled with information about biological conditions, and in some situations such as rare diseases, only very small datasets are available. We present MODIS, a semi supervised framework designed to account for these particular challenges. To address the challenge of very small datasets, we propose to exploit information contained in larger multi-omics databases by training our model on a large reference database and a small target dataset simultaneously, effectively turning the problem of transfer learning into a problem of learning with class imbalance. MODIS performs diagonal integration on unpaired samples, leveraging class-labels to align modalities despite class imbalance and data scarcity. The architecture combines multiple variational auto-encoders, a class classifier and an adversarially trained modality classifier. To ensure training stability, we adapted a regularized relativistic GAN loss to this setting. We first validate MODIS on a synthetic dataset to assess the level of supervision needed for accurate alignment and to quantify the impact of class imbalance on predictive performance. We then apply our approach to the large public TCGA database, considering between 10 and 34 classes (cancer types and normal tissue). MODIS demonstrates high prediction accuracy, robust performance with limited supervision, and stability to class imbalance. These results position MODIS as a promising solution for challenging integration scenarios, particularly diagonal integration with a small number of samples, typical of rare diseases studies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating human-like responses, largely due to preference alignment techniques. However, these methods often assume unbiased human feedback, which is rarely the case in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces Content-Aware Noise-Resilient Preference Optimization (CNRPO), a novel framework that addresses multiple sources of content-dependent noise in preference learning. CNRPO employs a multi-objective optimization approach to separate true preferences from content-aware noises, effectively mitigating their impact. We leverage backdoor attack mechanisms to efficiently learn and control various noise sources within a single model. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on different synthetic noisy datasets demonstrate that CNRPO significantly improves alignment with primary human preferences while controlling for secondary noises and biases, such as response length and harmfulness.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities across various tasks but also pose risks by generating harmful content. Existing safety mechanisms, while improving model safety, often lead to overly cautious behavior and fail to fully leverage LLMs' internal cognitive processes. Inspired by humans' reflective thinking capability, we first show that LLMs can similarly perform internal assessments about safety in their internal states. Building on this insight, we propose SafeSwitch, a dynamic framework that regulates unsafe outputs by utilizing the prober-based internal state monitor that actively detects harmful intentions, and activates a safety head that leads to safer and more conservative responses only when necessary. SafeSwitch reduces harmful outputs by approximately 80% on harmful queries while maintaining strong utility, reaching a Pareto optimal among several methods. Our method is also advantageous over traditional methods in offering more informative, context-aware refusals, and achieves these benefits while only tuning less than 6% of the original parameters. SafeSwitch demonstrates large language models' capacity for self-awareness and reflection regarding safety, offering a promising approach to more nuanced and effective safety controls.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Continual Learning (CL) is a highly relevant setting gaining traction in recent machine learning research. Among CL works, architectural and hybrid strategies are particularly effective due to their potential to adapt the model architecture as new tasks are presented. However, many existing solutions do not efficiently exploit model sparsity, and are prone to capacity saturation due to their inefficient use of available weights, which limits the number of learnable tasks. In this paper, we propose TinySubNets (TSN), a novel architectural CL strategy that addresses the issues through the unique combination of pruning with different sparsity levels, adaptive quantization, and weight sharing. Pruning identifies a subset of weights that preserve model performance, making less relevant weights available for future tasks. Adaptive quantization allows a single weight to be separated into multiple parts which can be assigned to different tasks. Weight sharing between tasks boosts the exploitation of capacity and task similarity, allowing for the identification of a better trade-off between model accuracy and capacity. These features allow TSN to efficiently leverage the available capacity, enhance knowledge transfer, and reduce computational resource consumption. Experimental results involving common benchmark CL datasets and scenarios show that our proposed strategy achieves better results in terms of accuracy than existing state-of-the-art CL strategies. Moreover, our strategy is shown to provide a significantly improved model capacity exploitation. Code released at:this https URL.

  The proliferation of IoT devices generates vast interaction data, offering insights into user behaviour. While prior work predicts what actions users perform, the timing of these actions -- critical for enabling proactive and efficient smart systems -- remains relatively underexplored. Addressing this gap, we focus on predicting the time of the next user action in smart environments. Due to the lack of public datasets with fine-grained timestamps suitable for this task and associated privacy concerns, we contribute a dataset of 11.6k sequences synthesized based on human annotations of interaction patterns, pairing actions with precise timestamps. To this end, we introduce Timing-Matters, a Transformer-Encoder based method that predicts action timing, achieving 38.30% accuracy on the synthesized dataset, outperforming the best baseline by 6%, and showing 1--6% improvements on other open datasets. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Noisy labels significantly hinder the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models, particularly when resulting from ambiguous instance features that complicate correct labeling. Traditional approaches, such as those relying on transition matrices for label correction, often struggle to effectively resolve such ambiguity, due to their inability to capture complex relationships between instances and noisy labels. In this paper, we propose EchoAlign, a paradigm shift in learning from noisy labels. Unlike previous methods that attempt to correct labels, EchoAlign treats noisy labels ($\tilde{Y}$) as accurate and modifies corresponding instances ($X$) to better align with these labels. The EchoAlign framework comprises two main components: (1) EchoMod leverages controllable generative models to selectively modify instance features, achieving alignment with noisy labels while preserving intrinsic instance characteristics such as shape, texture, and semantic identity. (2) EchoSelect mitigates distribution shifts introduced by instance modifications by strategically retaining a substantial subset of original instances with correct labels. Specifically, EchoSelect exploits feature similarity distributions between original and modified instances to accurately distinguish between correctly and incorrectly labeled samples. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that EchoAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-noise environments, achieving superior accuracy and robustness. Notably, under 30% instance-dependent noise, EchoSelect retains nearly twice the number of correctly labeled samples compared to previous methods, maintaining 99% selection accuracy, thereby clearly illustrating the effectiveness of EchoAlign. The implementation of EchoAlign is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models have demonstrated strong performance in recent years, but the high cost of training drives the need for efficient methods to compress dataset sizes. We propose TED pruning, a method that addresses the challenge of overfitting under high pruning ratios by quantifying the model's ability to improve performance on pruned data while fitting retained data, known as Internal Generalization (IG). TED uses an optimization objective based on Internal Generalization Distance (IGD), measuring changes in IG before and after pruning to align with true generalization performance and achieve implicit regularization. The IGD optimization objective was verified to allow the model to achieve the smallest upper bound on generalization error. The impact of small mask fluctuations on IG is studied through masks and Taylor approximation, and fast estimation of IGD is enabled. In analyzing continuous training dynamics, the prior effect of IGD is validated, and a progressive pruning strategy is proposed. Experiments on image classification, natural language understanding, and large language model fine-tuning show TED achieves lossless performance with 60-70\% of the data. Upon acceptance, our code will be made publicly available.

  Pruning before training enables the deployment of neural networks on smart devices. By retaining weights conducive to generalization, pruned networks can be accommodated on resource-constrained smart devices. It is commonly held that the distance on weight norms between the initialized and the fully-trained networks correlates with generalization performance. However, as we have uncovered, inconsistency between this metric and generalization during training processes, which poses an obstacle to determine the pruned structures on smart devices in advance. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the learning gap, emphasizing its accurate correlation with generalization. Experiments show that the learning gap, in the form of feature maps from the penultimate layer of networks, aligns with variations of generalization performance. We propose a novel learning framework, LNPT, which enables mature networks on the cloud to provide online guidance for network pruning and learning on smart devices with unlabeled data. Our results demonstrate the superiority of this approach over supervised training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large-scale Transformer models (TM) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various tasks. However, their considerable parameter size restricts their applicability, particularly on mobile devices. Due to the dynamic and intricate nature of gradients on TM compared to Convolutional Neural Networks, commonly used pruning methods tend to retain weights with larger gradient noise. This results in pruned models that are sensitive to sparsity and datasets, exhibiting suboptimal performance. Symbolic Descent (SD) is a general approach for training and fine-tuning TM. In this paper, we attempt to describe the noisy batch gradient sequences on TM through the cumulative process of SD. We utilize this design to dynamically assess the importance scores ofthis http URLis introduced by us, which particularly favors weights with consistently high sensitivity, i.e., weights with small gradient noise. These weights are tended to be preserved by SEVEN. Extensive experiments on various TM in natural language, question-answering, and image classification domains are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SEVEN. The results demonstrate significant improvements of SEVEN in multiple pruning scenarios and across different sparsity levels. Additionally, SEVEN exhibits robust performance under various fine-tuning strategies. The code is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As a pivotal branch of machine learning, manifold learning uncovers the intrinsic low-dimensional structure within complex nonlinear manifolds in high-dimensional space for visualization, classification, clustering, and gaining key insights. Although existing techniques have achieved remarkable successes, they suffer from extensive distortions of cluster structure, which hinders the understanding of underlying patterns. Scalability issues also limit their applicability for handling large-scale data. We hence propose a sampling-based Scalable manifold learning technique that enables Uniform and Discriminative Embedding, namely SUDE, for large-scale and high-dimensional data. It starts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton of the entire data, and then incorporates the non-landmarks into the learned space based on the constrained locally linear embedding (CLLE). We empirically validated the effectiveness of SUDE on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks, and applied it to analyze single-cell data and detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. SUDE exhibits distinct advantage in scalability with respect to data size and embedding dimension, and has promising performance in cluster separation, integrity, and global structure preservation. The experiments also demonstrate notable robustness in embedding quality as the sampling rate decreases.

  Calibrating deep neural models plays an important role in building reliable, robust AI systems in safety-critical applications. Recent work has shown that modern neural networks that possess high predictive capability are poorly calibrated and produce unreliable model predictions. Though deep learning models achieve remarkable performance on various benchmarks, the study of model calibration and reliability is relatively under-explored. Ideal deep models should have not only high predictive performance but also be well calibrated. There have been some recent advances in calibrating deep models. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art calibration methods and their principles for performing model calibration. First, we start with the definition of model calibration and explain the root causes of model miscalibration. Then we introduce the key metrics that can measure this aspect. It is followed by a summary of calibration methods that we roughly classify into four categories: post-hoc calibration, regularization methods, uncertainty estimation, and composition methods. We also cover recent advancements in calibrating large models, particularly large language models (LLMs). Finally, we discuss some open issues, challenges, and potential directions.

  Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment and has been increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving. Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.

  Multi-agent debate (MAD) has demonstrated the ability to augment collective intelligence by scaling test-time compute and leveraging expertise. Current frameworks for multi-agent debate are often designed towards tool use, lack integrated evaluation, or provide limited configurability of agent personas, response generators, discussion paradigms, and decision protocols. We introduce MALLM (Multi-Agent Large Language Models), an open-source framework that enables systematic analysis of MAD components. MALLM offers more than 144 unique configurations of MAD, including (1) agent personas (e.g., Expert, Personality), (2) response generators (e.g., Critical, Reasoning), (3) discussion paradigms (e.g., Memory, Relay), and (4) decision protocols (e.g., Voting, Consensus). MALLM uses simple configuration files to define a debate. Furthermore, MALLM can load any textual Huggingface dataset (e.g., MMLU-Pro, WinoGrande) and provides an evaluation pipeline for easy comparison of MAD configurations. MALLM is tailored towards researchers and provides a window into the heart of multi-agent debate, facilitating the understanding of its components and their interplay.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As underwater human activities are increasing, the demand for underwater communication service presents a significant challenge. Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.

  This paper studies how utility graphs decomposition algorithms can be used to effectively search for Pareto-efficient outcomes in complex automated negotiation. We propose a number of algorithms that can efficiently handle high-dimensional utility graphs, and test them on a variety of utility graph topologies, generated based on state of the art methods for analysing complex graphs. We show that we can achieve exponential speed-up, for many structures, even for very large utility graphs. To our knowledge, our approach can handle the largest utility spaces to date for complex interdependent negotiations, in terms of number of issues. Moreover, we examine the performance of our algorithms across two different types of elicitation queries from the literature: value and comparison queries, thus making a connection between automated negotiation and the preference elicitation literature.

  Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.

  As robots become increasingly prevalent in both homes and industrial settings, the demand for intuitive and efficient human-machine interaction continues to rise. Gesture recognition offers an intuitive control method that does not require physical contact with devices and can be implemented using various sensing technologies. Wireless solutions are particularly flexible and minimally invasive. While camera-based vision systems are commonly used, they often raise privacy concerns and can struggle in complex or poorly lit environments. In contrast, radar sensing preserves privacy, is robust to occlusions and lighting, and provides rich spatial data such as distance, relative velocity, and angle. We present a gesture-controlled robotic arm using mm-wave radar for reliable, contactless motion recognition. Nine gestures are recognized and mapped to real-time commands with precision. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the system practicality, performance and reliability for gesture-based robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work that treats gesture recognition and robotic control separately, our system unifies both into a real-time pipeline for seamless, contactless human-robot interaction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Semantic mapping aims to construct a 3D semantic representation of the environment, providing essential knowledge for robots operating in complex outdoor settings. While Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) addresses discontinuities of map inference from sparse sensor data, existing semantic mapping methods suffer from various sources of uncertainties in challenging outdoor environments. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware semantic mapping framework that handles multiple sources of uncertainties, which significantly degrade mapping performance. Our method estimates uncertainties in semantic predictions using Evidential Deep Learning and incorporates them into BKI for robust semantic inference. It further aggregates noisy observations into coherent Gaussian representations to mitigate the impact of unreliable points, while employing geometry-aligned kernels that adapt to complex scene structures. These Gaussian primitives effectively fuse local geometric and semantic information, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse off-road and urban outdoor environments demonstrates consistent improvements in mapping quality, uncertainty calibration, representational flexibility, and robustness, while maintaining real-time efficiency.

  Scaling Transformer policies and diffusion models has advanced robotic manipulation, yet combining these techniques in lightweight, cross-embodiment learning settings remains challenging. We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.

  Imitation learning (IL) enables efficient skill acquisition from demonstrations but often struggles with long-horizon tasks and high-precision control due to compounding errors. Residual policy learning offers a promising, model-agnostic solution by refining a base policy through closed-loop corrections. However, existing approaches primarily focus on local corrections to the base policy, lacking a global understanding of state evolution, which limits robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. To address this, we propose incorporating global dynamics modeling to guide residual policy updates. Specifically, we leverage Koopman operator theory to impose linear time-invariant structure in a learned latent space, enabling reliable state transitions and improved extrapolation for long-horizon prediction and unseen environments. We introduce KORR (Koopman-guided Online Residual Refinement), a simple yet effective framework that conditions residual corrections on Koopman-predicted latent states, enabling globally informed and stable action refinement. We evaluate KORR on long-horizon, fine-grained robotic furniture assembly tasks under various perturbations. Results demonstrate consistent gains in performance, robustness, and generalization over strong baselines. Our findings further highlight the potential of Koopman-based modeling to bridge modern learning methods with classical control theory. For more details, please refer tothis https URL.

  This paper investigates how the performance of visual navigation policies trained in simulation compares to policies trained with real-world data. Performance degradation of simulator-trained policies is often significant when they are evaluated in the real world. However, despite this well-known sim-to-real gap, we demonstrate that simulator-trained policies can match the performance of their real-world-trained counterparts.Central to our approach is a navigation policy architecture that bridges the sim-to-real appearance gap by leveraging pretrained visual representations and runs real-time on robot hardware. Evaluations on a wheeled mobile robot show that the proposed policy, when trained in simulation, outperforms its real-world-trained version by 31% and the prior state-of-the-art methods by 50% in navigation success rate. Policy generalization is verified by deploying the same model onboard a drone.Our results highlight the importance of diverse image encoder pretraining for sim-to-real generalization, and identify on-policy learning as a key advantage of simulated training over training with real data.

  Traditional industrial robot programming is often complex and time-consuming, typically requiring weeks or even months of effort from expert programmers. Although Programming by Demonstration (PbD) offers a more accessible alternative, intuitive interfaces for robot control and demonstration collection remain challenging. To address this, we propose an Augmented Reality (AR)-enhanced robot teleoperation system that integrates AR-based control with spatial point cloud rendering, enabling intuitive, contact-free demonstrations. This approach allows operators to control robots remotely without entering the workspace or using conventional tools like the teach pendant. The proposed system is generally applicable and has been demonstrated on ABB robot platforms, specifically validated with the IRB 1200 industrial robot and the GoFa 5 collaborative robot. A user study evaluates the impact of real-time environmental perception, specifically with and without point cloud rendering, on task completion accuracy, efficiency, and user confidence. Results indicate that enhanced perception significantly improves task performance by 28% and enhances user experience, as reflected by a 12% increase in the System Usability Scale (SUS) score. This work contributes to the advancement of intuitive robot teleoperation, AR interface design, environmental perception, and teleoperation safety mechanisms in industrial settings for demonstration collection. The collected demonstrations may serve as valuable training data for machine learning applications.

Transferring VLMs to embodied domains reveals fundamental mismatches between modalities, pretraining distributions, and training objectives, leaving action comprehension and generation as a central bottleneck on the path to AGI.We introduce WALL-OSS, an end-to-end embodied foundation model that leverages large-scale multimodal pretraining to achieve (1) embodiment-aware vision-language understanding, (2) strong language-action association, and (3) robust manipulation capability.Our approach employs a tightly coupled architecture and multi-strategies training curriculum that enables Unified Cross-Level CoT-seamlessly unifying instruction reasoning, subgoal decomposition, and fine-grained action synthesis within a single differentiable framework.Our results show that WALL-OSS attains high success on complex long-horizon manipulations, demonstrates strong instruction-following capabilities, complex understanding and reasoning, and outperforms strong baselines, thereby providing a reliable and scalable path from VLMs to embodied foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LiDAR-to-OpenStreetMap (OSM) localization has gained increasing attention, as OSM provides lightweight global priors such as building footprints. These priors enhance global consistency for robot navigation, but OSM is often incomplete or outdated, limiting its reliability in real-world deployment. Meanwhile, LiDAR itself suffers from a limited field of view (FoV), where motorized rotation is commonly used to achieve panoramic coverage. Existing motorized LiDAR systems, however, typically employ constant-speed scanning that disregards both scene structure and map priors, leading to wasted effort in feature-sparse regions and degraded localization accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive LiDAR Scanning with OSM guidance, a framework that integrates global priors with local observability prediction to improve localization robustness. Specifically, we augment uncertainty-aware model predictive control with an OSM-aware term that adaptively allocates scanning effort according to both scene-dependent observability and the spatial distribution of OSM features. The method is implemented in ROS with a motorized LiDAR odometry backend and evaluated in both simulation and real-world experiments. Results on campus roads, indoor corridors, and urban environments demonstrate significant reductions in trajectory error compared to constant-speed baselines, while maintaining scan completeness. These findings highlight the potential of coupling open-source maps with adaptive LiDAR scanning to achieve robust and efficient localization in complex environments.

  Autonomous stocking in retail environments, particularly supermarkets, presents challenges due to dynamic human interactions, constrained spaces, and diverse product geometries. This paper introduces an efficient end-to-end robotic system for autonomous shelf stocking and fronting, integrating commercially available hardware with a scalable algorithmic architecture. A major contribution of this work is the system integration of off-the-shelf hardware and ROS2-based perception, planning, and control into a single deployable platform for retail environments. Our solution leverages Behavior Trees (BTs) for task planning, fine-tuned vision models for object detection, and a two-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for precise shelf navigation using ArUco markers. Laboratory experiments replicating realistic supermarket conditions demonstrate reliable performance, achieving over 98% success in pick-and-place operations across a total of more than 700 stocking events. However, our comparative benchmarks indicate that the performance and cost-effectiveness of current autonomous systems remain inferior to that of human workers, which we use to highlight key improvement areas and quantify the progress still required before widespread commercial deployment can realistically be achieved.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper formulates the Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) problem, introduces a corresponding benchmark, and proposes a system to tackle the problem. Classical Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is typically formulated as answering one single question by actively exploring a 3D environment. Real deployments, however, often demand handling multiple questions that may arrive asynchronously and carry different urgencies. We formalize this setting as Embodied Questions Answering (EQsA) and present ParaEQsA, a framework for parallel, urgency-aware scheduling and answering. ParaEQsA leverages a group memory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a priority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this setting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs) benchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in total), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels. We further propose metrics for EQsA performance: Direct Answer Rate (DAR), and Normalized Urgency-Weighted Latency (NUWL), which jointly measure efficiency and responsiveness of this system. ParaEQsA consistently outperforms strong sequential baselines adapted from recent EQA systems, while reducing exploration and delay. Empirical evaluations investigate the relative contributions of priority, urgency modeling, spatial scope, reward estimation, and dependency reasoning within our framework. Together, these results demonstrate that urgency-aware, parallel scheduling is key to making embodied agents responsive and efficient under realistic, multi-question workloads.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion policies are powerful visuomotor models for robotic manipulation, yet they often fail to generalize to manipulators or end-effectors unseen during training and struggle to accommodate new task requirements at inference time. Addressing this typically requires costly data recollection and policy retraining for each new hardware or task configuration. To overcome this, we introduce an adaptation-projection strategy that enables a diffusion policy to perform zero-shot adaptation to novel manipulators and dynamic task settings, entirely at inference time and without any retraining. Our method first trains a diffusion policy in SE(3) space using demonstrations from a base manipulator. During online deployment, it projects the policy's generated trajectories to satisfy the kinematic and task-specific constraints imposed by the new hardware and objectives. Moreover, this projection dynamically adapts to physical differences (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) and task requirements (e.g., obstacle heights), ensuring robust and successful execution. We validate our approach on real-world pick-and-place, pushing, and pouring tasks across multiple manipulators, including the Franka Panda and Kuka iiwa 14, equipped with a diverse array of end-effectors like flexible grippers, Robotiq 2F/3F grippers, and various 3D-printed designs. Our results demonstrate consistently high success rates in these cross-manipulator scenarios, proving the effectiveness and practicality of our adaptation-projection strategy. The code will be released after peer review.

It requires the injection of domain-specific knowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction with humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the form of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content, they struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise reasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes the graph\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge representation\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and assembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate also supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with assembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns them with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph information. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address stacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster inference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong generalization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates superiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and real-world settings. More details can be found on the project page:this https URL

  _Jizhuo Chen, Diwen Liu, Jiaming Wang, Harold Soh_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  GBPP is a fast learning based scorer that selects a robot base pose for grasping from a single RGB-D snapshot. The method uses a two stage curriculum: (1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost; and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with targeted simulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soft continuum robots can allow for biocompatible yet compliant motions, such as the ability of octopus arms to swim, crawl, and manipulate objects. However, current state-of-the-art continuum robots can only achieve real-time task-space control (i.e., tip control) but not whole-shape control, mainly due to the high computational cost from its infinite degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for the shape control of simulated multi-segment tendon-driven soft continuum robots with the Kirchhoff rod model. Using data collected from these simulated soft robots, we conduct a per-segment projection scheme on the state of the robots allowing for the identification of control-affine Koopman models that are an order of magnitude more accurate than without the projection scheme. Using these learned Koopman models, we use a linear model predictive control (MPC) to control the robots to a collection of target shapes of varying complexity. Our method realizes computationally efficient closed-loop control, and demonstrates the feasibility of real-time shape control for soft robots. We envision this work can pave the way for practical shape control of soft continuum robots.

  Operating in environments too harsh or inaccessible for humans is one of the critical roles expected of robots. However, such environments often pose risks to electronic components as well. To overcome this, various approaches have been developed, including autonomous mobile robots without electronics, hydraulic remotely actuated mobile robots, and long-reach robot arms driven by wires. Among these, electronics-free autonomous robots cannot make complex decisions, while hydraulically actuated mobile robots and wire-driven robot arms are used in harsh environments such as nuclear power plants. Mobile robots offer greater reach and obstacle avoidance than robot arms, and wire mechanisms offer broader environmental applicability than hydraulics. However, wire-driven systems have not been used for remote actuation of mobile robots. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism called Remote Wire Drive that enables remote actuation of mobile robots via wires. This mechanism is a series connection of decoupled joints, a mechanism used in wire-driven robot arms, adapted for power transmission. We experimentally validated its feasibility by actuating a wire-driven quadruped robot, which we also developed in this study, through Remote Wire Drive.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fall recovery for legged robots remains challenging, particularly on complex terrains where traditional controllers fail due to incomplete terrain perception and uncertain interactions. We present \textbf{FR-Net}, a learning-based framework that enables quadrupedal robots to recover from arbitrary fall poses across diverse environments. Central to our approach is a Mass-Contact Predictor network that estimates the robot's mass distribution and contact states from limited sensory inputs, facilitating effective recovery strategies. Our carefully designed reward functions ensure safe recovery even on steep stairs without dangerous rolling motions common to existing methods. Trained entirely in simulation using privileged learning, our framework guides policy learning without requiring explicit terrain data during deployment. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of \textbf{FR-Net} across different quadrupedal platforms in simulation and validate its performance through extensive real-world experiments on the Go2 robot in 10 challenging scenarios. Our results indicate that explicit mass-contact prediction is key to robust fall recovery, offering a promising direction for generalizable quadrupedal skills.

  Humans are remarkably data-efficient when adapting to new unseen conditions, like driving a new car. In contrast, modern robotic control systems, like neural network policies trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), are highly specialized for single environments. Because of this overfitting, they are known to break down even under small differences like the Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) gap and require system identification and retraining for even minimal changes to the system. In this work, we present RAPTOR, a method for training a highly adaptive foundation policy for quadrotor control. Our method enables training a single, end-to-end neural-network policy to control a wide variety of quadrotors. We test 10 different real quadrotors from 32 g to 2.4 kg that also differ in motor type (brushed vs. brushless), frame type (soft vs. rigid), propeller type (2/3/4-blade), and flight controller (PX4/Betaflight/Crazyflie/M5StampFly). We find that a tiny, three-layer policy with only 2084 parameters is sufficient for zero-shot adaptation to a wide variety of platforms. The adaptation through In-Context Learning is made possible by using a recurrence in the hidden layer. The policy is trained through a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, where we sample 1000 quadrotors and train a teacher policy for each of them using Reinforcement Learning. Subsequently, the 1000 teachers are distilled into a single, adaptive student policy. We find that within milliseconds, the resulting foundation policy adapts zero-shot to unseen quadrotors. We extensively test the capabilities of the foundation policy under numerous conditions (trajectory tracking, indoor/outdoor, wind disturbance, poking, different propellers).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Affordable desktop CNC routers are common in education, prototyping, and makerspaces, but most lack a rotary axis, limiting fabrication of rotationally symmetric or multi-sided parts. Existing solutions often require hardware retrofits, alternative controllers, or commercial CAM software, raising cost and complexity. This work presents a software-only framework for indexed rotary machining on GRBL-based CNCs. A custom post-processor converts planar toolpaths into discrete rotary steps, executed through a browser-based interface. While not equivalent to continuous 4- axis machining, the method enables practical rotary-axis fabrication using only standard, off-the- shelf mechanics, without firmware modification. By reducing technical and financial barriers, the framework expands access to multi-axis machining in classrooms, makerspaces, and small workshops, supporting hands-on learning and rapid prototyping.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.

  Classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle in complex, high-dimensional environments because of their extensive parameter requirements and challenges posed by stochastic, non-deterministic settings. This study introduces quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) to train humanoid agents efficiently. While previous quantum RL models focused on smaller environments, such as wheeled robots and robotic arms, our work pioneers the application of QDRL to humanoid robotics, specifically in environments with substantial observation and action spaces, such as MuJoCo's Humanoid-v4 and Walker2d-v4. Using parameterized quantum circuits, we explored a hybrid quantum-classical setup to directly navigate high-dimensional state spaces, bypassing traditional mapping and planning. By integrating quantum computing with deep RL, we aim to develop models that can efficiently learn complex navigation tasks in humanoid robots. We evaluated the performance of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in classical RL against its quantum implementation. The results show that the quantum SAC achieves an 8% higher average return (246.40) than the classical SAC (228.36) after 92% fewer steps, highlighting the accelerated learning potential of quantum computing in RL tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation and tracking are critical for reliable robotic manipulation. However, zero-shot methods often fail under viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with "robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms classical baselines.

  For social robots to maintain long-term engagement as exercise instructors, rapport-building is essential. Motor mimicry--imitating one's physical actions--during social interaction has long been recognized as a powerful tool for fostering rapport, and it is widely used in rehabilitation exercises where patients mirror a physiotherapist or video demonstration. We developed a novel Brain-Robot Interface (BRI) that allows a social robot instructor to mimic a patient's exercise movements in real-time, using mental commands derived from the patient's intention. The system was evaluated in an exploratory study with 14 participants (3 physiotherapists and 11 hemiparetic patients recovering from stroke or other injuries). We found our system successfully demonstrated exercise mimicry in 12 sessions; however, accuracy varied. Participants had positive perceptions of the robot instructor, with high trust and acceptance levels, which were not affected by the introduction of BRI technology.

  Social robots offer a promising solution for autonomously guiding patients through physiotherapy exercise sessions, but effective deployment requires advanced decision-making to adapt to patient needs. A key challenge is the scarcity of patient behavior data for developing robust policies. To address this, we engaged 33 expert healthcare practitioners as patient proxies, using their interactions with our robot to inform a patient behavior model capable of generating exercise performance metrics and subjective scores on perceived exertion. We trained a reinforcement learning-based policy in simulation, demonstrating that it can adapt exercise instructions to individual exertion tolerances and fluctuating performance, while also being applicable to patients at different recovery stages with varying exercise plans.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, the efficient disassembly and recycling of power batteries have become a critical challenge for the circular economy. In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128. This research provides a new paradigm for enhancing the robustness and adaptability of embodied intelligence in complex industrial environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic systems deployed in real-world environments often operate under con- ditions of partial and often intermittent observability, where sensor inputs may be noisy, occluded, or entirely unavailable due to failures or environmental con- straints. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that assume full state observability are ill-equipped for such challenges. In this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recur- rent baselines, maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of explicit belief modeling in achieving robust, transferable, and data-efficient policies for real-world partially observable robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE), which links language instructions to perception and control in the real world, is a core capability of embodied robots. Recently, large-scale pretrained foundation models have been leveraged as shared priors for perception, reasoning, and action, enabling zero-shot VLN without task-specific training. However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability. On VLN-CE and real-world tests, DreamNav sets a new zero-shot state-of-the-art (SOTA), outperforming the strongest egocentric baseline with extra information by up to 7.49\% and 18.15\% in terms of SR and SPL metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first zero-shot VLN method to unify trajectory-level planning and active imagination while using only egocentric inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Neural-based motion planning methods have achieved remarkable progress for robotic manipulators, yet a fundamental challenge lies in simultaneously accounting for both the robot's physical shape and the surrounding environment when generating safe and feasible motions. Moreover, existing approaches often rely on simplified robot models or focus primarily on obstacle representation, which can lead to incomplete collision detection and degraded performance in cluttered scenes. To address these limitations, we propose spatial anchor-based motion policy (SAMP), a unified framework that simultaneously encodes the environment and the manipulator using signed distance field (SDF) anchored on a shared spatial grid. SAMP incorporates a dedicated robot SDF network that captures the manipulator's precise geometry, enabling collision-aware reasoning beyond coarse link approximations. These representations are fused on spatial anchors and used to train a neural motion policy that generates smooth, collision-free trajectories in the proposed efficient feature alignment strategy. Experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments consistently show that SAMP outperforms existing methods, delivering an 11% increase in success rate and a 7% reduction in collision rate. These results highlight the benefits of jointly modelling robot and environment geometry, demonstrating its practical value in challenging real-world environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Designing robust controllers for precise, arbitrary trajectory tracking with quadrotors is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and underactuation, and becomes harder with flexible cable-suspended payloads that introduce extra degrees of freedom and hybridness. Classical model-based methods offer stability guarantees but require extensive tuning and often do not adapt when the configuration changes, such as when a payload is added or removed, or when the payload mass or cable length varies. We present RoVerFly, a unified learning-based control framework in which a reinforcement learning (RL) policy serves as a robust and versatile tracking controller for standard quadrotors and for cable-suspended payload systems across a range of configurations. Trained with task and domain randomization, the controller is resilient to disturbances and varying dynamics. It achieves strong zero-shot generalization across payload settings, including no payload as well as varying mass and cable length, without controller switching or re-tuning, while retaining the interpretability and structure of a feedback tracking controller.

  Deploying visual reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world manipulation is often hindered by camera viewpoint changes. A policy trained from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over 5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.

  The embodied intelligence bridges the physical world and information space. As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both time-domain and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.

  Pogobots are a new type of open-source/open-hardware robots specifically designed for swarm robotics research. Their cost-effective and modular design, complemented by vibration-based and wheel-based locomotion, fast infrared communication and extensive software architecture facilitate the implementation of swarm intelligence algorithms. However, testing even simple distributed algorithms directly on robots is particularly labor-intensive. Scaling to more complex problems or calibrate user code parameters will have a prohibitively high strain on available resources. In this article we present Pogosim, a fast and scalable simulator for Pogobots, designed to reduce as much as possible algorithm development costs. The exact same code will be used in both simulation and to experimentally drive real robots. This article details the software architecture of Pogosim, explain how to write configuration files and user programs and how simulations approximate or differ from experiments. We describe how a large set of simulations can be launched in parallel, how to retrieve and analyze the simulation results, and how to optimize user code parameters using optimization algorithms.

  Learning robot manipulation from abundant human videos offers a scalable alternative to costly robot-specific data collection. However, domain gaps across visual, morphological, and physical aspects hinder direct imitation. To effectively bridge the domain gap, we propose ImMimic, an embodiment-agnostic co-training framework that leverages both human videos and a small amount of teleoperated robot demonstrations. ImMimic uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with either action- or visual-based mapping to map retargeted human hand poses to robot joints, followed by MixUp interpolation between paired human and robot trajectories. Our key insights are (1) retargeted human hand trajectories provide informative action labels, and (2) interpolation over the mapped data creates intermediate domains that facilitate smooth domain adaptation during co-training. Evaluations on four real-world manipulation tasks (Pick and Place, Push, Hammer, Flip) across four robotic embodiments (Robotiq, Fin Ray, Allegro, Ability) show that ImMimic improves task success rates and execution smoothness, highlighting its efficacy to bridge the domain gap for robust robot manipulation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Human-like embodied tactile perception is crucial for the next-generation intelligent robotics. Achieving large-area, full-body soft coverage with high sensitivity and rapid response, akin to human skin, remains a formidable challenge due to critical bottlenecks in encoding efficiency and wiring complexity in existing flexible tactile sensors, thus significantly hinder the scalability and real-time performance required for human skin-level tactile perception. Herein, we present a new architecture employing code division multiple access- inspired orthogonal digital encoding to overcome these challenges. Our decentralized encoding strategy transforms conventional serial signal transmission by enabling parallel superposition of energy-orthogonal base codes from distributed sensing nodes, drastically reducing wiring requirements and increasing data throughput. We implemented and validated this strategy with off-the-shelf 16-node sensing array to reconstruct the pressure distribution, achieving a temporal resolution of 12.8 ms using only a single transmission wire. Crucially, the architecture can maintain sub-20ms latency across orders-of-magnitude variations in node number (to thousands of nodes). By fundamentally redefining signal encoding paradigms in soft electronics, this work opens new frontiers in developing scalable embodied intelligent systems with human-like sensory capabilities.

  Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance.

  Compared with gears and linkages, wires constitute a lightweight, low-friction transmission mechanism. However, because wires are flexible materials, they tend to introduce large modeling errors, and their adoption in industrial and research robots remainsthis http URLthis study, we built a Universal Wire Testing Machine that enables measurement and adjustment of wire characteristics to improve the performance of wire-driven mechanisms. Using this testing machine, we carried out removal of initial wire stretch, measurement of tension transmission efficiency for eight different diameters of passive pulleys, and measurement of the dynamic behavior of variable-length wires. Finally, we applied the data obtained from this testing machine to the force control of an actual wire-driven robot, reducing the end-effector force error.

  Robot person following (RPF) -- mobile robots that follow and assist a specific person -- has emerging applications in personal assistance, security patrols, eldercare, and logistics. To be effective, such robots must follow the target while ensuring safety and comfort for both the target and surrounding people. In this work, we present the first end-to-end study of RPF, which (i) surveys representative scenarios, motion-planning methods, and evaluation metrics with a focus on safety and comfort; (ii) introduces Follow-Bench, a unified benchmark simulating diverse scenarios, including various target trajectory patterns, dynamic-crowd flows, and environmental layouts; and (iii) re-implements six popular RPF planners, ensuring that both safety and comfort are systematically considered. Moreover, we evaluate the two highest-performing planners from our benchmark on a differential-drive robot to provide insights into real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments provide quantitative insights into the safety-comfort trade-offs of existing planners, while revealing open challenges and future research directions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Despite the widespread adoption of endoscopic devices for several cancer screening procedures, manual control of these devices still remains challenging for clinicians, leading to several critical issues such as increased workload, fatigue, and distractions. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce the design and development of an intuitive, modular, and easily installable mechatronic framework. This framework includes (i) a novel nested collet-chuck gripping mechanism that can readily be integrated and assembled with the existing endoscopic devices and control their bending degrees-of-freedom (DoFs); (ii) a feeder mechanism that can control the insertion/retraction DoF of a colonoscope, and (iii) a complementary and intuitive user interface that enables simultaneous control of all DoFs during the procedure. To analyze the design of the proposed mechanisms, we also introduce a mathematical modeling approach and a design space for optimal selection of the parameters involved in the design of gripping and feeder mechanisms. Our simulation and experimental studies thoroughly demonstrate the performance of the proposed mathematical modeling and robotic framework.

  This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in LiDAR-based autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), covering their design, perception, planning, and control strategies. Over the past decade, LiDAR technology has become a crucial enabler for high-speed, agile, and reliable UAV navigation, especially in GPS-denied environments. The paper begins by examining the evolution of LiDAR sensors, emphasizing their unique advantages such as high accuracy, long-range depth measurements, and robust performance under various lighting conditions, making them particularly well-suited for UAV applications. The integration of LiDAR with UAVs has significantly enhanced their autonomy, enabling complex missions in diverse and challenging environments. Subsequently, we explore essential software components, including perception technologies for state estimation and mapping, as well as trajectory planning and control methodologies, and discuss their adoption in LiDAR-based UAVs. Additionally, we analyze various practical applications of the LiDAR-based UAVs, ranging from industrial operations to supporting different aerial platforms and UAV swarm deployments. The survey concludes by discussing existing challenges and proposing future research directions to advance LiDAR-based UAVs and enhance multi-UAV collaboration. By synthesizing recent developments, this paper aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working to push the boundaries of LiDAR-based UAV systems.

  _Giuseppe Silano, Amr Afifi, Martin Saska, Antonio Franchi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a novel approach to motion planning and risk analysis for enhancing human-robot collaboration using a Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle (MRAV). The proposed method uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to encode key mission objectives, such as safety, timing, and human preferences, with a strong focus on ergonomics and comfort. An optimization framework generates dynamically feasible trajectories while considering the MRAV's physical constraints. Given the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, smooth approximations and gradient-based techniques assist in handling the problem's computational complexity. Additionally, an uncertainty-aware risk analysis is incorporated to assess potential deviations from the mission specifications, providing insights into the likelihood of mission success under uncertain conditions. Further, an event-triggered replanning strategy is implemented to respond to unforeseen events and external disturbances. The approach is validated through MATLAB and Gazebo simulations, using an object handover task in a mock-up environment inspired by power line maintenance scenarios. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in achieving safe, efficient, and resilient human-robot collaboration.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Trajectory prediction serves as a critical functionality in autonomous driving, enabling the anticipation of future motion paths for traffic participants such as vehicles and pedestrians, which is essential for driving safety. Although conventional deep learning methods have improved accuracy, they remain hindered by inherent limitations, including lack of interpretability, heavy reliance on large-scale annotated data, and weak generalization in long-tail scenarios. The rise of Large Foundation Models (LFMs) is transforming the research paradigm of trajectory prediction. This survey offers a systematic review of recent advances in LFMs, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for trajectory prediction. By integrating linguistic and scene semantics, LFMs facilitate interpretable contextual reasoning, significantly enhancing prediction safety and generalization in complex environments. The article highlights three core methodologies: trajectory-language mapping, multimodal fusion, and constraint-based reasoning. It covers prediction tasks for both vehicles and pedestrians, evaluation metrics, and dataset analyses. Key challenges such as computational latency, data scarcity, and real-world robustness are discussed, along with future research directions including low-latency inference, causality-aware modeling, and motion foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to PySensors, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations, and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a single "optimal" sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality and applicability to emerging sensing challenges.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances. In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances, enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the primary factors contributing to its success.

  Recent years have seen a focus on research into distributed optimization algorithms for multi-robot Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (C-SLAM). Research in this domain, however, is made difficult by a lack of standard benchmark datasets. Such datasets have been used to great effect in the field of single-robot SLAM, and researchers focused on multi-robot problems would benefit greatly from dedicated benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we design and release the Collaborative Open-Source Multi-robot Optimization Benchmark (COSMO-Bench) -- a suite of 24 datasets derived from a baseline C-SLAM front-end and real-world LiDAR data.

  We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We address the problem of agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion, where a pursuer and an evader learn to outmaneuver each other through reinforcement learning (RL). Such settings face two major challenges: non-stationarity, since each agent's evolving policy alters the environment dynamics and destabilizes training, and catastrophic forgetting, where a policy overfits to the current adversary and loses effectiveness against previously encountered strategies. To tackle these issues, we propose an Asynchronous Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm. At each stage, the pursuer and evader are trained asynchronously against a frozen pool of opponents sampled from a growing population of past and current policies, stabilizing training and ensuring exposure to diverse behaviors. Within this framework, we train neural network controllers that output either velocity commands or body rates with collective thrust. Experiments in a high-fidelity simulator show that: (i) AMSPB-trained RL policies outperform RL and geometric baselines; (ii) body-rate-and-thrust controllers achieve more agile flight than velocity-based controllers, leading to better pursuit-evasion performance; (iii) AMSPB yields stable, monotonic gains across stages; and (iv) trained policies in one arena size generalize fairly well to other sizes without retraining.

  This paper extends the fall prediction algorithm from Mungai et al.(2024) to a real-time/online setting, implemented in both hardware and simulation. This yields results comparable to the offline version, maintaining a zero false positive rate, sufficient lead time, and accurate lead time prediction. Additionally, it achieves a high recovery rate. The paper also evaluates the fall prediction algorithm against omnidirectional faults and introduces an improved algorithm capable of reliably predicting falls and lead times across a wider range of faults in full-sized robots. Compared to Mungai et al.(2024), the proposed algorithm performs significantly better across all metrics, such as false positive rate, lead time, accuracy, and response time, demonstrating the algorithm's efficacy for real-time fall prediction in bipedal robots.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.

  We present a VR-based teleoperation system for multirotor flight that renders a third-person view (TPV) of the vehicle together with a live 3D reconstruction of its surroundings. The system runs on an embedded GPU (Jetson Orin NX) with ROS2-WebXR integration and streams geometry and video to a headset for closed-loop control in previously unmapped spaces. We implement a first-person video (FPV) baseline and perform matched trials with two pilots in unmapped indoor spaces. Quantitative metrics are reported from repeated trials with one pilot (N=8). TPV achieved task time comparable to FPV while improving proximal obstacle awareness (minimum obstacle distance +0.20m) and reducing contacts. These results indicate that TPV can preserve control quality while exposing hazards less visible in FPV, supporting safer teleoperation in unknown environments.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a unified gait-conditioned reinforcement learning framework that enables humanoid robots to perform standing, walking, running, and smooth transitions within a single recurrent policy. A compact reward routing mechanism dynamically activates gait-specific objectives based on a one-hot gait ID, mitigating reward interference and supporting stable multi-gait learning. Human-inspired reward terms promote biomechanically natural motions, such as straight-knee stance and coordinated arm-leg swing, without requiring motion capture data. A structured curriculum progressively introduces gait complexity and expands command space over multiple phases. In simulation, the policy successfully achieves robust standing, walking, running, and gait transitions. On the real Unitree G1 humanoid, we validate standing, walking, and walk-to-stand transitions, demonstrating stable and coordinated locomotion. This work provides a scalable, reference-free solution toward versatile and naturalistic humanoid control across diverse modes and environments.

  We present GrasMolmo, a generalizable open-vocabulary task-oriented grasping (TOG) model. GraspMolmo predicts semantically appropriate, stable grasps conditioned on a natural language instruction and a single RGB-D frame. For instance, given "pour me some tea", GraspMolmo selects a grasp on a teapot handle rather than its body. Unlike prior TOG methods, which are limited by small datasets, simplistic language, and uncluttered scenes, GraspMolmo learns from PRISM, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset of 379k samples featuring cluttered environments and diverse, realistic task descriptions. We fine-tune the Molmo visual-language model on this data, enabling GraspMolmo to generalize to novel open-vocabulary instructions and objects. In challenging real-world evaluations, GraspMolmo achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 70% prediction success on complex tasks, compared to the 35% achieved by the next best alternative. GraspMolmo also successfully demonstrates the ability to predict semantically correct bimanual grasps zero-shot. We release our synthetic dataset, code, model, and benchmarks to accelerate research in task-semantic robotic manipulation, which, along with videos, are available atthis https URL.

  Teleoperation is a cornerstone of embodied-robot learning, and bimanual dexterous teleoperation in particular provides rich demonstrations that are difficult to obtain with fully autonomous systems. While recent studies have proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10 held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation. Codes is now available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To perform outdoor autonomous visual navigation and search, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, complex environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan - a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like distance travel, providing more efficient path planning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics. Our source code is available here:this https URL

  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, the field still lacks a practical platform that enables dynamic model updates, rapid validation, fair comparison, and intuitive performance assessment. To that end, we introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. LightEMMA provides a unified, VLM-based autonomous driving framework without ad hoc customizations, enabling easy integration with evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their performance on the challenging nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing computational metrics and providing critical insights. Illustrative examples show that, although VLMs exhibit strong scenario interpretation capabilities, their practical performance in autonomous driving tasks remains a concern. Additionally, increased model complexity and extended reasoning do not necessarily lead to better performance, emphasizing the need for further improvements and task-specific designs.

  Tool use is essential for enabling robots to perform complex real-world tasks, but learning such skills requires extensive datasets. While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\% and 41\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The tractor-trailer robot consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves severalfold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents a training-free pipeline for task-oriented grasp generation that combines pre-trained grasp generation models with vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on stable grasps, our method incorporates task-specific requirements by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate five querying strategies, each utilizing different visual representations of candidate grasps, and demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline method in both grasp success and task compliance rates, with absolute gains of up to 36.9\% in overall success rate. Our results underline the potential of VLMs to enhance task-oriented manipulation, providing insights for future research in robotic grasping and human-robot interaction.

  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities in Multi-Robot Systems (MRS), enabling enhanced communication, task planning, and human-robot interaction. Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source GitHub repository.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Koopman operator theory provides a powerful data-driven technique for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems in a linear framework, in comparison to computationally expensive and highly nonlinear physics-based simulations. However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.

  Reliable task planning is pivotal for achieving long-horizon autonomy in real-world robotic systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising interface for translating complex and ambiguous natural language instructions into actionable plans. However, their probabilistic and opaque nature often leads to logically inconsistent or infeasible outputs. To address these limitations, recent frameworks combine LLMs with symbolic planners by first generating action models (Planning Domain Definition Language) and then applying heuristic search. Although promising, such systems still suffer from representation redundancy and exponential search complexity, often resulting in inefficient or overly long plans. To improve planning efficiency and effectiveness, we propose PLAHX (Planning from Language using Abstraction and Heuristic eXploration), a two-stage LLM-symbolic planning framework that integrates abstract symbolic representations with meta-heuristic subspace search in a parallel and iterative fashion. Rather than relying on verbose LLM-generated domain models, we introduce a minimalist symbolic abstraction pipeline that preserves semantic fidelity while eliminating redundancy. Our approach redefines LLM-symbolic planning not by making LLMs smarter, but by reducing the symbolic search space adaptively. Empirical results across four challenging domains, including block stacking and robotic mobile grasping, show that our approach improves the success rate by 21.47% on average, while reducing token consumption by 13% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Training a policy that can generalize to unknown objects is a long standing challenge within the field of robotics. The performance of a policy often drops significantly in situations where an object in the scene was not seen during training. To solve this problem, we present NeRF-Aug, a novel method that is capable of teaching a policy to interact with objects that are not present in the dataset. This approach differs from existing approaches by leveraging the speed, photorealism, and 3D consistency of a neural radiance field for augmentation. NeRF-Aug both creates more photorealistic data and runs 63% faster than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 5 tasks with 9 novel objects that are not present in the expert demonstrations. We achieve an average performance boost of 55.6% when comparing our method to the next best method. You can see video results atthis https URL.

  The anticipation of human behavior is a crucial capability for robots to interact with humans safely and efficiently. We employ a smart edge sensor network to provide global observations, future predictions, and goal information to integrate anticipatory behavior for the control of a mobile manipulation robot. We present approaches to anticipate human behavior in the context of safe navigation and collaborative mobile manipulation. First, we anticipate human motion by employing projections of predicted human trajectories from smart edge sensor observations into the planning map of a mobile robot. Second, we anticipate human intentions in a collaborative furniture-carrying task to achieve a given room layout. Our experiments indicate that anticipating human behavior allows for safer navigation and more efficient collaboration. Finally, we showcase an integrated robotic system that anticipates human behavior while collaborating with an operator to achieve a target room layout, including the placement of tables and chairs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A fundamental objective in intelligent robotics is to move towards lifelong learning robot that can learn and adapt to unseen scenarios over time. However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.

  Imagine sitting at your desk, looking at objects on it. You do not know their exact distances from your eye in meters, but you can immediately reach out and touch them. Instead of an externally defined unit, your sense of distance is tied to your action's embodiment. In contrast, conventional robotics relies on precise calibration to external units, with which vision and control processes communicate. We introduce Embodied Visuomotor Representation, a methodology for inferring distance in a unit implied by action. With it a robot without knowledge of its size, environmental scale, or strength can quickly learn to touch and clear obstacles within seconds of operation. Likewise, in simulation, an agent without knowledge of its mass or strength can successfully jump across a gap of unknown size after a few test oscillations. These behaviors mirror natural strategies observed in bees and gerbils, which also lack calibration in an external unit.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Enhancing visual odometry by exploiting sparse depth measurements from LiDAR is a promising solution for improving tracking accuracy of an odometry. Most existing works utilize a monocular pinhole camera, yet could suffer from poor robustness due to less available information from limited field-of-view (FOV). This paper proposes a panoramic direct LiDAR-assisted visual odometry, which fully associates the 360-degree FOV LiDAR points with the 360-degree FOV panoramic image datas. 360-degree FOV panoramic images can provide more available information, which can compensate inaccurate pose estimation caused by insufficient texture or motion blur from a single view. In addition to constraints between a specific view at different times, constraints can also be built between different views at the same moment. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the benefit of large FOV of our panoramic direct LiDAR-assisted visual odometry to state-of-the-art approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

  Common approaches to providing feedback in reinforcement learning are the use of hand-crafted rewards or full-trajectory expert demonstrations. Alternatively, one can use examples of completed tasks, but such an approach can be extremely sample inefficient. We introduce value-penalized auxiliary control from examples (VPACE), an algorithm that significantly improves exploration in example-based control by adding examples of simple auxiliary tasks and an above-success-level value penalty. Across both simulated and real robotic environments, we show that our approach substantially improves learning efficiency for challenging tasks, while maintaining bounded value estimates. Preliminary results also suggest that VPACE may learn more efficiently than the more common approaches of using full trajectories or true sparse rewards. Project site:this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper presents Yummy Operations Robot Initiative (YORI), a proprioceptive dual-arm robotic system that demonstrates autonomous multi-dish cooking for scalable food service applications. YORI integrates a dual-arm manipulator equipped with proprioceptive actuators, custom-designed tools, appliances, and a structured kitchen environment to address the complexities of cooking tasks. The proprioceptive actuators enable fast, precise, force-controlled movements while mitigating the risks associated with cooking-related impacts. The system's modular kitchen design and flexible tool-changing mechanism support simultaneous multi-dish preparation through torque control and optimization-based motion planning and scheduling. A comprehensive scheduling framework with dynamic rescheduling ensures reliable adaptation to new orders and delays. The system was publicly validated through live demonstrations, reliably preparing steak-frites across multiple convention sessions. This paper details YORI's design and explores future directions in kitchen optimization, task planning, and food quality control, demonstrating its potential as a scalable robotic cooking solution. A system introduction and cooking videos are available online.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose MetaEMG, a meta-learning approach for fast adaptation in intent inferral on a robotic hand orthosis for stroke. One key challenge in machine learning for assistive and rehabilitative robotics with disabled-bodied subjects is the difficulty of collecting labeled training data. Muscle tone and spasticity often vary significantly among stroke subjects, and hand function can even change across different use sessions of the device for the same subject. We investigate the use of meta-learning to mitigate the burden of data collection needed to adapt high-capacity neural networks to a new session or subject. Our experiments on real clinical data collected from five stroke subjects show that MetaEMG can improve the intent inferral accuracy with a small session- or subject-specific dataset and very few fine-tuning epochs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formulate intent inferral on stroke subjects as a meta-learning problem and demonstrate fast adaptation to a new session or subject for controlling a robotic hand orthosis with EMG signals.
