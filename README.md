- **[Mutual Information Tracks Policy Coherence in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10423)**  `arXiv:2509.10423`  
  _Cameron Reid, Wael Hafez, Amirhossein Nazeri_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents deployed in real-world environments face degradation from sensor faults, actuator wear, and environmental shifts, yet lack intrinsic mechanisms to detect and diagnose these failures. We present an information-theoretic framework that reveals both the fundamental dynamics of RL and provides practical methods for diagnosing deployment-time anomalies. Through analysis of state-action mutual information patterns in a robotic control task, we first demonstrate that successful learning exhibits characteristic information signatures: mutual information between states and actions steadily increases from 0.84 to 2.83 bits (238% growth) despite growing state entropy, indicating that agents develop increasingly selective attention to task-relevant patterns. Intriguingly, states, actions and next states joint mutual information, MI(S,A;S'), follows an inverted U-curve, peaking during early learning before declining as the agent specializes suggesting a transition from broad exploration to efficient exploitation. More immediately actionable, we show that information metrics can differentially diagnose system failures: observation-space, i.e., states noise (sensor faults) produces broad collapses across all information channels with pronounced drops in state-action coupling, while action-space noise (actuator faults) selectively disrupts action-outcome predictability while preserving state-action relationships. This differential diagnostic capability demonstrated through controlled perturbation experiments enables precise fault localization without architectural modifications or performance degradation. By establishing information patterns as both signatures of learning and diagnostic for system health, we provide the foundation for adaptive RL systems capable of autonomous fault detection and policy adjustment based on information-theoretic principles.

- **[Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10401)**  `arXiv:2509.10401`  
  _Alva West, Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Zhen Lin, Yue Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs, leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P) Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's 12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for automated failure attribution.

- **[The Morality of Probability: How Implicit Moral Biases in LLMs May Shape the Future of Human-AI Symbiosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10297)**  `arXiv:2509.10297`  
  _Eoin O'Doherty, Nicole Weinrauch, Andrew Talone, Uri Klempner, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a pace that raises urgent questions about how to align machine decision-making with human moral values. This working paper investigates how leading AI systems prioritize moral outcomes and what this reveals about the prospects for human-AI symbiosis. We address two central questions: (1) What moral values do state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) implicitly favour when confronted with dilemmas? (2) How do differences in model architecture, cultural origin, and explainability affect these moral preferences? To explore these questions, we conduct a quantitative experiment with six LLMs, ranking and scoring outcomes across 18 dilemmas representing five moral frameworks. Our findings uncover strikingly consistent value biases. Across all models, Care and Virtue values outcomes were rated most moral, while libertarian choices were consistently penalized. Reasoning-enabled models exhibited greater sensitivity to context and provided richer explanations, whereas non-reasoning models produced more uniform but opaque judgments. This research makes three contributions: (i) Empirically, it delivers a large-scale comparison of moral reasoning across culturally distinct LLMs; (ii) Theoretically, it links probabilistic model behaviour with underlying value encodings; (iii) Practically, it highlights the need for explainability and cultural awareness as critical design principles to guide AI toward a transparent, aligned, and symbiotic future.

- **[Investigating Language Model Capabilities to Represent and Process Formal Knowledge: A Preliminary Study to Assist Ontology Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10249)**  `arXiv:2509.10249`  
  _Hanna Abi Akl_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in Language Models (LMs) have failed to mask their shortcomings particularly in the domain of reasoning. This limitation impacts several tasks, most notably those involving ontology engineering. As part of a PhD research, we investigate the consequences of incorporating formal methods on the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) on reasoning tasks. Specifically, we aim to orient our work toward using SLMs to bootstrap ontology construction and set up a series of preliminary experiments to determine the impact of expressing logical problems with different grammars on the performance of SLMs on a predefined reasoning task. Our findings show that it is possible to substitute Natural Language (NL) with a more compact logical language while maintaining a strong performance on reasoning tasks and hope to use these results to further refine the role of SLMs in ontology engineering.

- **[Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10222)**  `arXiv:2509.10222`  
  _Ma√´l Jullien, Lei Xu, Marco Valentino, Andr√© Freitas_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner.Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a framework for safer, auditable reasoning.

- **[Towards Fully Automated Molecular Simulations: Multi-Agent Framework for Simulation Setup and Force Field Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10210)**  `arXiv:2509.10210`  
  _Marko Petkoviƒá, Vlado Menkovski, Sof√≠a Calero_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated characterization of porous materials has the potential to accelerate materials discovery, but it remains limited by the complexity of simulation setup and force field selection. We propose a multi-agent framework in which LLM-based agents can autonomously understand a characterization task, plan appropriate simulations, assemble relevant force fields, execute them and interpret their results to guide subsequent steps. As a first step toward this vision, we present a multi-agent system for literature-informed force field extraction and automated RASPA simulation setup. Initial evaluations demonstrate high correctness and reproducibility, highlighting this approach's potential to enable fully autonomous, scalable materials characterization.

- **[Online Robust Planning under Model Uncertainty: A Sample-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10162)**  `arXiv:2509.10162`  
  _Tamir Shazman, Idan Lev-Yehudi, Ron Benchetit, Vadim Indelman_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Online planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) enables agents to make sequential decisions by simulating future trajectories from the current state, making it well-suited for large-scale or dynamic environments. Sample-based methods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely adopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative model. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned from limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade performance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust MDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty, yet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited for real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the first online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical performance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal value function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the efficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA), enabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings. RSS is applicable to infinite or continuous state spaces, and its sample and computational complexities are independent of the state space size. We provide theoretical performance guarantees and empirically show that RSS outperforms standard Sparse Sampling in environments with uncertain dynamics.

  _Nenad Tomasev, Matija Franklin, Joel Z. Leibo, Julian Jacobs, William A. Cunningham, Iason Gabriel, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid adoption of autonomous AI agents is giving rise to a new economic layer where agents transact and coordinate at scales and speeds beyond direct human oversight. We propose the "sandbox economy" as a framework for analyzing this emergent system, characterizing it along two key dimensions: its origins (emergent vs. intentional) and its degree of separateness from the established human economy (permeable vs. impermeable). Our current trajectory points toward a spontaneous emergence of a vast and highly permeable AI agent economy, presenting us with opportunities for an unprecedented degree of coordination as well as significant challenges, including systemic economic risk and exacerbated inequality. Here we discuss a number of possible design choices that may lead to safely steerable AI agent markets. In particular, we consider auction mechanisms for fair resource allocation and preference resolution, the design of AI "mission economies" to coordinate around achieving collective goals, and socio-technical infrastructure needed to ensure trust, safety, and accountability. By doing this, we argue for the proactive design of steerable agent markets to ensure the coming technological shift aligns with humanity's long-term collective flourishing.

- **[XAgents: A Unified Framework for Multi-Agent Cooperation via IF-THEN Rules and Multipolar Task Processing Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10054)**  `arXiv:2509.10054`  
  _Hailong Yang, Mingxian Gu, Jianqi Wang, Guanjin Wang, Zhaohong Deng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in supporting humans with complex, real-world tasks. However, MAS still face challenges in effective task planning when handling highly complex tasks with uncertainty, often resulting in misleading or incorrect outputs that hinder task execution. To address this, we propose XAgents, a unified multi-agent cooperative framework built on a multipolar task processing graph and IF-THEN rules. XAgents uses the multipolar task processing graph to enable dynamic task planning and handle task uncertainty. During subtask processing, it integrates domain-specific IF-THEN rules to constrain agent behaviors, while global rules enhance inter-agent collaboration. We evaluate the performance of XAgents across three distinct datasets, demonstrating that it consistently surpasses state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches in both knowledge-typed and logic-typed question-answering tasks. The codes for XAgents are available at:this https URL.

  _Hailong Yang, Renhuo Zhao, Guanjin Wang, Zhaohong Deng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM), LLM-based agents exhibit exceptional abilities in understanding and generating natural language, facilitating human-like collaboration and information transmission in LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS). High-performance LLMs are often hosted on remote servers in public spaces. When tasks involve privacy data, MAS cannot securely utilize these LLMs without implementing privacy-preserving mechanisms. To address this challenge, we propose a General Anonymizing Multi-Agent system (GAMA), which divides the agents' workspace into private and public spaces and protects privacy through the anonymizing mechanism. In the private space, agents handle sensitive data, while in the public space, only anonymized data is utilized. GAMA incorporates two key modules to mitigate semantic loss caused by anonymization: Domain-Rule-based Knowledge Enhancement (DRKE) and Disproof-based Logic Enhancement (DLE). We evaluate GAMA on two public question-answering datasets: Trivia Creative Writing and Logic Grid Puzzle. The results demonstrate that GAMA has superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models. To further assess its privacy-preserving capabilities, we designed two new datasets: Knowledge Privacy Preservation and Logic Privacy Preservation. The final results highlight GAMA's exceptional effectiveness in both task processing and privacy preservation.

- **[Evaluation of Black-Box XAI Approaches for Predictors of Values of Boolean Formulae](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09982)**  `arXiv:2509.09982`  
  _Stav Armoni-Friedmann, Hana Chockler, David A. Kelly_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Evaluating explainable AI (XAI) approaches is a challenging task in general, due to the subjectivity of explanations. In this paper, we focus on tabular data and the specific use case of AI models predicting the values of Boolean functions. We extend the previous work in this domain by proposing a formal and precise measure of importance of variables based on actual causality, and we evaluate state-of-the-art XAI tools against this measure. We also present a novel XAI tool B-ReX, based on the existing tool ReX, and demonstrate that it is superior to other black-box XAI tools on a large-scale benchmark. Specifically, B-ReX achieves a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.072 $\pm$ 0.012 on random 10-valued Boolean formulae

- **[A Markovian Framing of WaveFunctionCollapse for Procedurally Generating Aesthetically Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09919)**  `arXiv:2509.09919`  
  _Franklin Yiu, Mohan Lu, Nina Li, Kevin Joseph, Tianxu Zhang, Julian Togelius, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Procedural content generation often requires satisfying both designer-specified objectives and adjacency constraints implicitly imposed by the underlying tile set. To address the challenges of jointly optimizing both constraints and objectives, we reformulate WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling external optimization algorithms to focus exclusively on objective maximization while leveraging WFC's propagation mechanism to enforce constraint satisfaction. We empirically compare optimizing this MDP to traditional evolutionary approaches that jointly optimize global metrics and local tile placement. Across multiple domains with various difficulties, we find that joint optimization not only struggles as task complexity increases, but consistently underperforms relative to optimization over the WFC-MDP, underscoring the advantages of decoupling local constraint satisfaction from global objective optimization.

- **[LLMs as Agentic Cooperative Players in Multiplayer UNO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09867)**  `arXiv:2509.09867`  
  _Yago Romano Matinez, Jesse Roberts_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  LLMs promise to assist humans -- not just by answering questions, but by offering useful guidance across a wide range of tasks. But how far does that assistance go? Can a large language model based agent actually help someone accomplish their goal as an active participant? We test this question by engaging an LLM in UNO, a turn-based card game, asking it not to win but instead help another player to do so. We built a tool that allows decoder-only LLMs to participate as agents within the RLCard game environment. These models receive full game-state information and respond using simple text prompts under two distinct prompting strategies. We evaluate models ranging from small (1B parameters) to large (70B parameters) and explore how model scale impacts performance. We find that while all models were able to successfully outperform a random baseline when playing UNO, few were able to significantly aid another player.

- **[Towards an AI-based knowledge assistant for goat farmers based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09848)**  `arXiv:2509.09848`  
  _Nana Han, Dong Liu, Tomas Norton_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being recognised as valuable knowledge communication tools in many industries. However, their application in livestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not least the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This study introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support health management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods, table textualization and decision-tree textualization, were proposed to enhance large language models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on these methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to improve LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base spans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management, Rearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge. Additionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time retrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six ablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each component. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method achieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set and 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree based Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the effectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error analysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting opportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In conclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the proposed system for practical applications in goat farming.

- **[Towards a Common Framework for Autoformalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09810)**  `arXiv:2509.09810`  
  _Agnieszka Mensfelt, David Tena Cucala, Santiago Franco, Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki, Vince Trencsenyi, Kostas Stathis_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Autoformalization has emerged as a term referring to the automation of formalization - specifically, the formalization of mathematics using interactive theorem provers (proof assistants). Its rapid development has been driven by progress in deep learning, especially large language models (LLMs). More recently, the term has expanded beyond mathematics to describe the broader task of translating informal input into formal logical representations. At the same time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal language into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge representation - often without explicitly referring to this process as autoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely independent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could accelerate progress. The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit - instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a unified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to advance the development of next generation AI systems.

- **[A Modular and Multimodal Generative AI Framework for Urban Building Energy Data: Generating Synthetic Homes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09794)**  `arXiv:2509.09794`  
  _Jackson Eshbaugh, Chetan Tiwari, Jorge Silveyra_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Computational models have emerged as powerful tools for energy modeling research, touting scalability and quantitative results. However, these models require a plethora of data, some of which is inaccessible, expensive, or raises privacy concerns. We introduce a modular multimodal framework to produce this data from publicly accessible residential information and images using generative artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we provide a pipeline demonstrating this framework, and we evaluate its generative AI components. Our experiments show that our framework's use of AI avoids common issues with generative models. Our framework produces realistic, labeled data. By reducing dependence on costly or restricted data sources, we pave a path towards more accessible and reproducible research.

  _Yuxuan Li, Victor Zhong_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning to plan in grounded environments typically requires carefully designed reward functions or high-quality annotated demonstrations. Recent works show that pretrained foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), capture background knowledge helpful for planning, which reduces the amount of reward design and demonstrations needed for policy learning. We evaluate how well LLMs and VLMs provide feedback across symbolic, language, and continuous control environments. We consider prominent types of feedback for planning including binary feedback, preference feedback, action advising, goal advising, and delta action feedback. We also consider inference methods that impact feedback performance, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and access to environment dynamics. We find that foundation models can provide diverse high-quality feedback across domains. Moreover, larger and reasoning models consistently provide more accurate feedback, exhibit less bias, and benefit more from enhanced inference methods. Finally, feedback quality degrades for environments with complex dynamics or continuous state spaces and action spaces.

  _Minhyuk Kim, Seungyoon Lee, Heuiseok Lim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples, limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

  _Soheil Zibakhsh Shabgahi, Pedram Aghazadeh, Azalia Mirhoseini, Farinaz Koushanfar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in recursive training.We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the era of increasing synthetic data.

  _Yuxuan Cai, Yipeng Hao, Jie Zhou, Hang Yan, Zhikai Lei, Rui Zhen, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm

  _Mingyu Kang, Duxin Chen, Ziyuan Pu, Jianxi Gao, Wenwu Yu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Counterfactual thinking is a critical yet challenging topic for artificial intelligence to learn knowledge from data and ultimately improve their performances for new scenarios. Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.

- **[WhisTLE: Deeply Supervised, Text-Only Domain Adaptation for Pretrained Speech Recognition Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10452)**  `arXiv:2509.10452`  
  _Akshat Pandey, Karun Kumar, Raphael Tang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance. In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical, necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised, text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost.

  Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with browsing tools substantially improves their potential as deep search agents to solve complex, real-world tasks. Yet, open LLMs still perform poorly in such settings due to limited long-horizon reasoning capacity with browsing tools and the lack of sufficiently difficult supervised data. To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1. We demonstrate that multi-turn RL training improves deep search ability and significantly contributes to the performance improvements across multiple benchmarks. We observe that DeepDive enables test-time scaling of tool calls and parallel sampling. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  To optimize the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative architecture that enables a structured, multi-agent prompting framework. This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.

  _Christopher Ormerod, Gitit Kehat_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Transformer-based language models are architecturally constrained to process text of a fixed maximum length. Essays written by higher-grade students frequently exceed the maximum allowed length for many popular open-source models. A common approach to addressing this issue when using these models for Automated Essay Scoring is to truncate the input text. This raises serious validity concerns as it undermines the model's ability to fully capture and evaluate organizational elements of the scoring rubric, which requires long contexts to assess. In this study, we evaluate several models that incorporate architectural modifications of the standard transformer architecture to overcome these length limitations using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The models considered in this study include fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer, ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models.

  _Adrian de Wynter_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In-context learning (ICL) allows some autoregressive models to solve tasks via next-token prediction and without needing further training. This has led to claims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a few shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply learning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the models rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue that, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full characterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale analysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining, distributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an effective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise to unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more numerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt style, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from regularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity, especially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied accuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc encoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose generalisability.

  _Yixiao Zhou, Ziyu Zhao, Dongzhou Cheng, zhiliang wu, Jie Gui, Yi Yang, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures are widely used in large language models (LLMs) due to their computational efficiency. However, though only a few experts are activated for each token, SMoE still requires loading all expert parameters, leading to high memory usage and challenges in deployment. Previous work has tried to reduce the overhead by pruning and merging experts, but primarily focused on expert-level operations, leaving neuron-level structure underexplored. We propose DERN (Dropping Experts, Recombining Neurons), a task-agnostic and retraining-free framework for expert pruning and reconstruction. We observe that experts are often misaligned and contain semantic conflicts at the neuron level, which poses challenges for direct merging. To solve this, DERN works in three steps: it first prunes redundant experts using router statistics; then it decomposes them into neuron-level expert segments, assigning each segment to its most compatible retained expert; and finally, it merges segments within each retained expert to build a compact representation. Experiments on Mixtral, Qwen, and DeepSeek SMoE models show that DERN improves performance by more than 5% on commonsense reasoning and MMLU benchmarks under 50% expert sparsity, without extra training. It also greatly reduces the number of experts and memory usage, making SMoE LLMs easier to deploy in practice.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The most widely used large language models in the social sciences (such as BERT, and its derivatives, e.g. RoBERTa) have a limitation on the input text length that they can process to produce predictions. This is a particularly pressing issue for some classification tasks, where the aim is to handle long input texts. One such area deals with laws and draft laws (bills), which can have a length of multiple hundred pages and, therefore, are not particularly amenable for processing with models that can only handle e.g. 512 tokens. In this paper, we show results from experiments covering 5 languages with XLM-RoBERTa, Longformer, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 models for the multiclass classification task of the Comparative Agendas Project, which has a codebook of 21 policy topic labels from education to health care. Results show no particular advantage for the Longformer model, pre-trained specifically for the purposes of handling long inputs. The comparison between the GPT variants and the best-performing open model yielded an edge for the latter. An analysis of class-level factors points to the importance of support and substance overlaps between specific categories when it comes to performance on long text inputs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In emotionally supportive conversations, well-intended positivity can sometimes misfire, leading to responses that feel dismissive, minimizing, or unrealistically optimistic. We examine this phenomenon of incongruent positivity as miscalibrated expressions of positive support in both human and LLM generated responses. To this end, we collected real user-assistant dialogues from Reddit across a range of emotional intensities and generated additional responses using large language models for the same context. We categorize these conversations by intensity into two levels: Mild, which covers relationship tension and general advice, and Severe, which covers grief and anxiety conversations. This level of categorization enables a comparative analysis of how supportive responses vary across lower and higher stakes contexts. Our analysis reveals that LLMs are more prone to unrealistic positivity through dismissive and minimizing tone, particularly in high-stakes contexts. To further study the underlying dimensions of this phenomenon, we finetune LLMs on datasets with strong and weak emotional reactions. Moreover, we developed a weakly supervised multilabel classifier ensemble (DeBERTa and MentalBERT) that shows improved detection of incongruent positivity types across two sorts of concerns (Mild and Severe). Our findings shed light on the need to move beyond merely generating generic positive responses and instead study the congruent support measures to balance positive affect with emotional acknowledgment. This approach offers insights into aligning large language models with affective expectations in the online supportive dialogue, paving the way toward context-aware and trust preserving online conversation systems.

  This study investigates the register variation in texts written by humans and comparable texts produced by large language models (LLMs). Biber's multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used, which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16 frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and ranked in interpretable dimensions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation. Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate, flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The development of medical chatbots in Arabic is significantly constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. While prior efforts compiled a dataset of 20,000 Arabic patient-doctor interactions from social media to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), model scalability and generalization remained limited. In this study, we propose a scalable synthetic data augmentation strategy to expand the training corpus to 100,000 records. Using advanced generative AI systems ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro we generated 80,000 contextually relevant and medically coherent synthetic question-answer pairs grounded in the structure of the original dataset. These synthetic samples were semantically filtered, manually validated, and integrated into the training pipeline. We fine-tuned five LLMs, including Mistral-7B and AraGPT2, and evaluated their performance using BERTScore metrics and expert-driven qualitative assessments. To further analyze the effectiveness of synthetic sources, we conducted an ablation study comparing ChatGPT-4o and Gemini-generated data independently. The results showed that ChatGPT-4o data consistently led to higher F1-scores and fewer hallucinations across all models. Overall, our findings demonstrate the viability of synthetic augmentation as a practical solution for enhancing domain-specific language models in-low resource medical NLP, paving the way for more inclusive, scalable, and accurate Arabic healthcare chatbot systems.

  Efficient hospital management systems (HMS) are critical worldwide to address challenges such as overcrowding, limited resources, and poor availability of urgent health care. Existing methods often lack the ability to provide accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2 Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text. Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and F1-scores of 68.5\%, 69.08\%, and 68.5\%, respectively. Comparative benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.

  The growing complexity and volume of climate science literature make it increasingly difficult for researchers to find relevant information across models, datasets, regions, and variables. This paper introduces a domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) built from climate publications and broader scientific texts, aimed at improving how climate knowledge is accessed and used. Unlike keyword based search, our KG supports structured, semantic queries that help researchers discover precise connections such as which models have been validated in specific regions or which datasets are commonly used with certain teleconnection patterns. We demonstrate how the KG answers such questions using Cypher queries, and outline its integration with large language models in RAG systems to improve transparency and reliability in climate-related question answering. This work moves beyond KG construction to show its real world value for climate researchers, model developers, and others who rely on accurate, contextual scientific information.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Researchers have applied established psychometric questionnaires (e.g., BFI, PVQ) to measure the personality traits and values reflected in the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, concerns have been raised about applying these human-designed questionnaires to LLMs. One such concern is their lack of ecological validity--the extent to which survey questions adequately reflect and resemble real-world contexts in which LLMs generate texts in response to user queries. However, it remains unclear how established questionnaires and ecologically valid questionnaires differ in their outcomes, and what insights these differences may provide. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two types of questionnaires. Our analysis reveals that established questionnaires (1) yield substantially different profiles of LLMs from ecologically valid ones, deviating from the psychological characteristics expressed in the context of user queries, (2) suffer from insufficient items for stable measurement, (3) create misleading impressions that LLMs possess stable constructs, and (4) yield exaggerated profiles for persona-prompted LLMs. Overall, our work cautions against the use of established psychological questionnaires for LLMs. Our code will be released upon publication.

  We present MSAs winning system for the BAREC 2025 Shared Task on fine-grained Arabic readability assessment, achieving first place in six of six tracks. Our approach is a confidence-weighted ensemble of four complementary transformer models (AraBERTv2, AraELECTRA, MARBERT, and CAMeLBERT) each fine-tuned with distinct loss functions to capture diverse readability signals. To tackle severe class imbalance and data scarcity, we applied weighted training, advanced preprocessing, SAMER corpus relabeling with our strongest model, and synthetic data generation via Gemini 2.5 Flash, adding about 10,000 rare-level samples. A targeted post-processing step corrected prediction distribution skew, delivering a 6.3 percent Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) gain. Our system reached 87.5 percent QWK at the sentence level and 87.4 percent at the document level, demonstrating the power of model and loss diversity, confidence-informed fusion, and intelligent augmentation for robust Arabic readability prediction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users' diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data. While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS, an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for real-time detection.

  Minority languages in China, such as Tibetan, Uyghur, and Traditional Mongolian, face significant challenges due to their unique writing systems, which differ from international standards. This discrepancy has led to a severe lack of relevant corpora, particularly for supervised tasks like headline generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset, Chinese Minority Headline Generation (CMHG), which includes 100,000 entries for Tibetan, and 50,000 entries each for Uyghur and Mongolian, specifically curated for headline generation tasks. Additionally, we propose a high-quality test set annotated by native speakers, designed to serve as a benchmark for future research in this domain. We hope this dataset will become a valuable resource for advancing headline generation in Chinese minority languages and contribute to the development of related benchmarks.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for methodological and applied innovations in survey research by using synthetic respondents to emulate human answers and behaviour, potentially mitigating measurement and representation errors. However, the extent to which LLMs recover aggregate item distributions remains uncertain and downstream applications risk reproducing social stereotypes and biases inherited from training data. We evaluate the reliability of LLM-generated synthetic survey responses against ground-truth human responses from a Chilean public opinion probabilistic survey. Specifically, we benchmark 128 prompt-model-question triplets, generating 189,696 synthetic profiles, and pool performance metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) in a meta-analysis across 128 question-subsample pairs to test for biases along key sociodemographic dimensions. The evaluation spans OpenAI's GPT family and o-series reasoning models, as well as Llama and Qwen checkpoints. Three results stand out. First, synthetic responses achieve excellent performance on trust items (F1-score and accuracy > 0.90). Second, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini and Llama 4 Maverick perform comparably on this task. Third, synthetic-human alignment is highest among respondents aged 45-59. Overall, LLM-based synthetic samples approximate responses from a probabilistic sample, though with substantial item-level heterogeneity. Capturing the full nuance of public opinion remains challenging and requires careful calibration and additional distributional tests to ensure algorithmic fidelity and reduce errors.

  A key challenge in Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is effectively integrating information from multiple sources while maintaining coherence and topical relevance. While Large Language Models have shown impressive results in single-document summarization, their performance on MDS still leaves room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a topic-guided reinforcement learning approach to improve content selection in MDS. We first show that explicitly prompting models with topic labels enhances the informativeness of the generated summaries. Building on this insight, we propose a novel topic reward within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to measure topic alignment between the generated summary and source documents. Experimental results on the Multi-News and Multi-XScience datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging topical cues in MDS.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper proposes a framework for modeling multimodal conversational turn organization via the proposition of correlations between language and interactive gestures, based on analysis as to how pragmatic frames are conceptualized and evoked by communicators. As a means to provide evidence for the analysis, we developed an annotation methodology to enrich a multimodal dataset (annotated for semantic frames) with pragmatic frames modeling conversational turn organization. Although conversational turn organization has been studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies, especially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a dataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched the Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization. The Frame2 dataset features 10 episodes from the Brazilian TV series Pedro Pelo Mundo annotated for semantic frames evoked in both video and text. This dataset allowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures outside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in related literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in face-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking and keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures that had not been documented before. We propose that the use of these gestures arises from the conceptualization of pragmatic frames, involving mental spaces, blending and conceptual metaphors. In addition, our data demonstrate that the annotation of pragmatic frames contributes to a deeper understanding of human cognition and language.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to specialized reasoning tasks is fundamentally constrained by computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a powerful solution, yet the landscape of these techniques is diverse, with distinct methods operating in either the model's weight space or its representation space. This paper investigates the hypothesis that a synergistic combination of these paradigms can unlock superior performance and efficiency. We introduce HEFT (Hierarchical Efficient Fine-Tuning), a novel hierarchical adaptation strategy that composes two distinct PEFT methods in a coarse-to-fine manner: first, a broad, foundational adaptation in the weight space using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), followed by a precise, surgical refinement of internal activations using Representation Fine-Tuning (ReFT). We evaluate this approach by fine-tuning a Llama-2-7B model on the BoolQ benchmark, a challenging dataset for inferential reasoning. Our results reveal a profound synergistic effect. A model fine-tuned for only three epochs with our HEFT strategy achieves an accuracy of 85.17\%, exceeding the performance of models trained for 20 epochs with either LoRA-only (85.05\%) or ReFT-only (83.36\%) methodologies. This work demonstrates that the thoughtful composition of PEFT methods is a potent algorithmic innovation, offering a more efficient and effective path toward advancing the reasoning capabilities of language models. By achieving superior results with a fraction of the computational budget, our findings present a principled approach to overcoming the obstacles inherent in adapting large-scale models for complex cognitive tasks.

  The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various domains raises concerns about societal inequalities and information bias. This study examines biases in LLMs related to background, gender, and age, with a focus on their impact on decision-making and summarization tasks. Additionally, the research examines the cross-lingual propagation of these biases and evaluates the effectiveness of prompt-instructed mitigation strategies. Using an adapted version of the dataset by Tamkin et al. (2023) translated into Dutch, we created 151,200 unique prompts for the decision task and 176,400 for the summarisation task. Various demographic variables, instructions, salience levels, and languages were tested on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our analysis revealed that both models were significantly biased during decision-making, favouring female gender, younger ages, and certain backgrounds such as the African-American background. In contrast, the summarisation task showed minimal evidence of bias, though significant age-related differences emerged for GPT-3.5 in English. Cross-lingual analysis showed that bias patterns were broadly similar between English and Dutch, though notable differences were observed across specific demographic categories. The newly proposed mitigation instructions, while unable to eliminate biases completely, demonstrated potential in reducing them. The most effective instruction achieved a 27\% mean reduction in the gap between the most and least favorable demographics. Notably, contrary to GPT-3.5, GPT-4o displayed reduced biases for all prompts in English, indicating the specific potential for prompt-based mitigation within newer models. This research underscores the importance of cautious adoption of LLMs and context-specific bias testing, highlighting the need for continued development of effective mitigation strategies to ensure responsible deployment of AI.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as a pivotal open standard, designed to enhance agent-tool integration and interoperability, and is positioned to unlock a new era of powerful, interconnected, and genuinely utilitarian agentic AI. However, despite MCP's growing adoption, existing benchmarks often fail to capture real-world agent performance within this new paradigm, leading to a distorted perception of their true operational value and an inability to reliably differentiate proficiencies. To bridge this critical evaluation gap, we introduce MCP-AgentBench -- a comprehensive benchmark specifically engineered to rigorously assess language agent capabilities in MCP-mediated tool interactions. Core contributions of MCP-AgentBench include: the establishment of a robust MCP testbed comprising 33 operational servers with 188 distinct tools; the development of a benchmark featuring 600 systematically designed queries distributed across 6 distinct categories of varying interaction complexity; and the introduction of MCP-Eval, a novel outcome-oriented evaluation methodology prioritizing real-world task success. Through extensive empirical evaluation of leading language agents, we provide foundational insights. MCP-AgentBench aims to equip the research community with a standardized and reliable framework to build, validate, and advance agents capable of fully leveraging MCP's transformative benefits, thereby accelerating progress toward truly capable and interoperable AI systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Chinese ancient documents, invaluable carriers of millennia of Chinese history and culture, hold rich knowledge across diverse fields but face challenges in digitization and understanding, i.e., traditional methods only scan images, while current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with their visual and linguistic complexity. Existing document benchmarks focus on English printed texts or simplified Chinese, leaving a gap for evaluating VLMs on ancient Chinese documents. To address this, we present AncientDoc, the first benchmark for Chinese ancient documents, designed to assess VLMs from OCR to knowledge reasoning. AncientDoc includes five tasks (page-level OCR, vernacular translation, reasoning-based QA, knowledge-based QA, linguistic variant QA) and covers 14 document types, over 100 books, and about 3,000 pages. Based on AncientDoc, we evaluate mainstream VLMs using multiple metrics, supplemented by a human-aligned large language model for scoring.

  This paper proposes a natural language translation method for machine-verifiable formal proofs that leverages the informalization (verbalization of formal language proof steps) and summarization capabilities of LLMs. For evaluation, it was applied to formal proof data created in accordance with natural language proofs taken from an undergraduate-level textbook, and the quality of the generated natural language proofs was analyzed in comparison with the original natural language proofs. Furthermore, we will demonstrate that this method can output highly readable and accurate natural language proofs by applying it to existing formal proof library of the Lean proof assistant.

  Entity linking (EL) for biomedical text is typically benchmarked on English-only corpora with flat mentions, leaving the more realistic scenario of nested and multilingual mentions largely unexplored. We present our system for the BioNNE 2025 Multilingual Biomedical Nested Named Entity Linking shared task (English & Russian), closing this gap with a lightweight pipeline that keeps the original EL model intact and modifies only three task-aligned components: Two-stage retrieval-ranking. We leverage the same base encoder model in both stages: the retrieval stage uses the original pre-trained model, while the ranking stage applies domain-specific fine-tuning. Boundary cues. In the ranking stage, we wrap each mention with learnable [Ms] / [Me] tags, providing the encoder with an explicit, language-agnostic span before robustness to overlap and nesting. Dataset augmentation. We also automatically expand the ranking training corpus with three complementary data sources, enhancing coverage without extra manual annotation. On the BioNNE 2025 leaderboard, our two stage system, bilingual bert (BIBERT-Pipe), ranks third in the multilingual track, demonstrating the effectiveness and competitiveness of these minimal yet principled modifications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Technology opportunities are critical information that serve as a foundation for advancements in technology, industry, and innovation. This paper proposes a framework based on the temporal relationships between technologies to identify emerging technology opportunities. The proposed framework begins by extracting text from a patent dataset, followed by mapping text-based topics to discover inter-technology relationships. Technology opportunities are then identified by tracking changes in these topics over time. To enhance efficiency, the framework leverages a large language model to extract topics and employs a prompt for a chat-based language model to support the discovery of technology opportunities. The framework was evaluated using an artificial intelligence patent dataset provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The experimental results suggest that artificial intelligence technology is evolving into forms that facilitate everyday accessibility. This approach demonstrates the potential of the proposed framework to identify future technology opportunities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a well studied problem. However, the properties that make LLM intrinsically vulnerable to hallucinations have not been identified and studied. This research identifies and characterizes the key properties, allowing us to pinpoint vulnerabilities within the model's internal mechanisms. To solidify on these properties, we utilized two established datasets, HaluEval and TruthfulQA and convert their existing format of question answering into various other formats to narrow down these properties as the reason for the hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination percentages across symbolic properties are notably high for Gemma-2-2B, averaging 79.0% across tasks and datasets. With increased model scale, hallucination drops to 73.6% for Gemma-2-9B and 63.9% for Gemma-2-27B, reflecting a 15 percentage point reduction overall. Although the hallucination rate decreases as the model size increases, a substantial amount of hallucination caused by symbolic properties still persists. This is especially evident for modifiers (ranging from 84.76% to 94.98%) and named entities (ranging from 83.87% to 93.96%) across all Gemma models and both datasets. These findings indicate that symbolic elements continue to confuse the models, pointing to a fundamental weakness in how these LLMs process such inputs--regardless of their scale.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This research examines how well different methods measure semantic similarity, which is important for various software engineering applications such as code search, API recommendations, automated code reviews, and refactoring tools. While large language models are increasingly used for these similarity assessments, questions remain about whether they truly understand semantic relationships or merely recognize surface patterns.The study tested 18 different similarity measurement approaches, including word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and structure-aware algorithms. The researchers created a systematic testing framework that applies controlled changes to text and code to evaluate how well each method handles different types of semantic relationships.The results revealed significant issues with commonly used metrics. Some embedding-based methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up to 99.9 percent of the time, while certain transformer-based approaches occasionally rated opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The study found that embedding methods' poor performance often stemmed from how they calculate distances; switching from Euclidean distance to cosine similarity improved results by 24 to 66 percent. LLM-based approaches performed better at distinguishing semantic differences, producing low similarity scores (0.00 to 0.29) for genuinely different meanings, compared to embedding methods that incorrectly assigned high scores (0.82 to 0.99) to dissimilar content.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach enhances question-answering systems and dialogue generation tasks by integrating information retrieval (IR) technologies with large language models (LLMs). This strategy, which retrieves information from external knowledge bases to bolster the response capabilities of generative models, has achieved certain successes. However, current RAG methods still face numerous challenges when dealing with multi-hop queries. For instance, some approaches overly rely on iterative retrieval, wasting too many retrieval steps on compound queries. Additionally, using the original complex query for retrieval may fail to capture content relevant to specific sub-queries, resulting in noisy retrieved content. If the noise is not managed, it can lead to the problem of noise accumulation. To address these issues, we introduce HANRAG, a novel heuristic-based framework designed to efficiently tackle problems of varying complexity. Driven by a powerful revelator, HANRAG routes queries, decomposes them into sub-queries, and filters noise from retrieved documents. This enhances the system's adaptability and noise resistance, making it highly capable of handling diverse queries. We compare the proposed framework against other leading industry methods across various benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our framework obtains superior performance in both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy with emerging evidence of efficacy in several psychiatric conditions. This study investigates the impact of post-training methodology and explicit reasoning on the ability of a small open-weight large language model (LLM) to deliver ACT. Using 50 sets of synthetic ACT transcripts generated by Mistral-Large, we trained Llama-3.2-3b-Instruct with two distinct approaches, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and odds ratio policy optimization (ORPO), each with and without an explicit chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning step. Performance was evaluated by comparing these four post-trained variants against the base Instruct model. These models were benchmarked in simulated therapy sessions, with performance quantitatively assessed on the ACT Fidelity Measure (ACT-FM) and the Therapist Empathy Scale (TES) by an LLM judge that had been fine-tuned on human evaluations. Our findings demonstrate that the ORPO-trained models significantly outperformed both their SFT and Instruct counterparts on ACT fidelity ($\chi^2(5) = 185.15, p < .001$) and therapeutic empathy ($\chi^2(5) = 140.37, p < .001$). The effect of COT was conditional as it provided a significant benefit to SFT models, improving ACT-FM scores by an average of 2.68 points ($p < .001$), while offering no discernible advantage to the superior ORPO or instruct-tuned variants. We posit that the superiority of ORPO stems from its ability to learn the therapeutic `process' over imitating `content,' a key aspect of ACT, while COT acts as a necessary scaffold for models trained only via imitation. This study establishes that preference-aligned policy optimization can effectively instill ACT competencies in small LLMs, and that the utility of explicit reasoning is highly dependent on the underlying training paradigm.

  Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up, management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models (e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an "LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental health applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study introduces a Large Language Model (LLM) scheme for generating individual travel diaries in agent-based transportation models. While traditional approaches rely on large quantities of proprietary household travel surveys, the method presented in this study generates personas stochastically from open-source American Community Survey (ACS) and Smart Location Database (SLD) data, then synthesizes diaries through direct prompting. This study features a novel one-to-cohort realism score: a composite of four metrics (Trip Count Score, Interval Score, Purpose Score, and Mode Score) validated against the Connecticut Statewide Transportation Study (CSTS) diaries, matched across demographic variables. The validation utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to measure distributional similarities between generated and real diaries. When compared to diaries generated with classical methods (Negative Binomial for trip generation; Multinomial Logit for mode/purpose) calibrated on the validation set, LLM-generated diaries achieve comparable overall realism (LLM mean: 0.485 vs. 0.455). The LLM excels in determining trip purpose and demonstrates greater consistency (narrower realism score distribution), while classical models lead in numerical estimates of trip count and activity duration. Aggregate validation confirms the LLM's statistical representativeness (LLM mean: 0.612 vs. 0.435), demonstrating LLM's zero-shot viability and establishing a quantifiable metric of diary realism for future synthetic diary evaluation systems.

  Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly used in academic writing, yet issues such as incorrect or fabricated references raise ethical concerns. Moreover, current content quality evaluations often rely on subjective human judgment, which is labor-intensive and lacks objectivity, potentially compromising the consistency and reliability. In this study, to provide a quantitative evaluation and enhance research proposal writing capabilities of LLMs, we propose two key evaluation metrics--content quality and reference validity--and an iterative prompting method based on the scores derived from these two metrics. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics provide an objective, quantitative framework for assessing ChatGPT's writing performance. Additionally, iterative prompting significantly enhances content quality while reducing reference inaccuracies and fabrications, addressing critical ethical challenges in academic contexts.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Refusal on harmful prompts is a key safety behaviour in instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), yet the internal causes of this behaviour remain poorly understood. We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering: prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed. Our findings highlight the potential for fine-grained auditing and targeted intervention in safety behaviours by manipulating the interpretable latent space.

  This work explores the consistency of small LLMs (2B-8B parameters) in answering multiple times the same question. We present a study on known, open-source LLMs responding to 10 repetitions of questions from the multiple-choice benchmarks MMLU-Redux and MedQA, considering different inference temperatures, small vs. medium models (50B-80B), finetuned vs. base models, and other parameters. We also look into the effects of requiring multi-trial answer consistency on accuracy and the trade-offs involved in deciding which model best provides both of them. To support those studies, we propose some new analytical and graphical tools. Results show that the number of questions which can be answered consistently vary considerably among models but are typically in the 50%-80% range for small models at low inference temperatures. Also, accuracy among consistent answers seems to reasonably correlate with overall accuracy. Results for medium-sized models seem to indicate much higher levels of answer consistency.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns around intellectual property (IP) protection, as model theft and unauthorized redistribution become increasingly feasible. To address this, model fingerprinting aims to embed verifiable ownership traces into LLMs. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between stealthness, robustness, and generalizability, being either detectable via distributional shifts, vulnerable to adversarial modifications, or easily invalidated once the fingerprint is revealed. In this work, we introduce CTCC, a novel rule-driven fingerprinting framework that encodes contextual correlations across multiple dialogue turns, such as counterfactual, rather than relying on token-level or single-turn triggers. CTCC enables fingerprint verification under black-box access while mitigating false positives and fingerprint leakage, supporting continuous construction under a shared semantic rule even if partial triggers are exposed. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that CTCC consistently achieves stronger stealth and robustness than prior work. Our findings position CTCC as a reliable and practical solution for ownership verification in real-world LLM deployment scenarios. Our code and data are publicly available at <this https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  End-to-end speech-to-text translation typically suffers from the scarcity of paired speech-text data. One way to overcome this shortcoming is to utilize the bitext data from the Machine Translation (MT) task and perform Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In this paper, we formulate MTL from a regularization perspective and explore how sequences can be regularized within and across modalities. By thoroughly investigating the effect of consistency regularization (different modality) and R-drop (same modality), we show how they respectively contribute to the total regularization. We also demonstrate that the coefficient of MT loss serves as another source of regularization in the MTL setting. With these three sources of regularization, we introduce the optimal regularization contour in the high-dimensional space, called the regularization horizon. Experiments show that tuning the hyperparameters within the regularization horizon achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the MuST-C dataset.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the large-scale adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various applications, there is a growing reliability concern due to their tendency to generate inaccurate text, i.e. hallucinations. In this work, we propose Cross-Layer Attention Probing (CLAP), a novel activation probing technique for hallucination detection, which processes the LLM activations across the entire residual stream as a joint sequence. Our empirical evaluations using five LLMs and three tasks show that CLAP improves hallucination detection compared to baselines on both greedy decoded responses as well as responses sampled at higher temperatures, thus enabling fine-grained detection, i.e. the ability to disambiguate hallucinations and non-hallucinations among different sampled responses to a given prompt. This allows us to propose a detect-then-mitigate strategy using CLAP to reduce hallucinations and improve LLM reliability compared to direct mitigation approaches. Finally, we show that CLAP maintains high reliability even when applied out-of-distribution.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mapping clinical documents to standardised clinical vocabularies is an important task, as it provides structured data for information retrieval and analysis, which is essential to clinical research, hospital administration and improving patient care. However, manual coding is both difficult and time-consuming, making it impractical at scale. Automated coding can potentially alleviate this burden, improving the availability and accuracy of structured clinical data. The task is difficult to automate, as it requires mapping to high-dimensional and long-tailed target spaces, such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While external knowledge sources have been readily utilised to enhance output code representation, the use of external resources for representing the input documents has been underexplored. In this work, we compute a structured representation of the input documents, making use of document-level knowledge graphs (KGs) that provide a comprehensive structured view of a patient's condition. The resulting knowledge graph efficiently represents the patient-centred input documents with 23\% of the original text while retaining 90\% of the information. We assess the effectiveness of this graph for automated ICD-9 coding by integrating it into the state-of-the-art ICD coding architecture PLM-ICD. Our experiments yield improved Macro-F1 scores by up to 3.20\% on popular benchmarks, while improving training efficiency. We attribute this improvement to different types of entities and relationships in the KG, and demonstrate the improved explainability potential of the approach over the text-only baseline.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and code will be open-source atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning for broader chat workflows.Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8), MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves 75.4% on MMLU.

  Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

Traditional neuroimaging is costly and lab-bound, but abundant digital text offers new avenues for emotion-brain mapping. Prior work has largely examined neuroimaging-based emotion localization or computational text analysis separately, with little integration. We propose a computational framework that maps textual emotional content to anatomically defined brain regions without requiring neuroimaging. Using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, we generate high-dimensional semantic representations, apply dimensionality reduction and clustering to identify emotional groups, and map them to 18 brain regions linked to emotional processing. Three experiments were conducted: i) analyzing conversational data from healthy vs. depressed subjects (DIAC-WOZ dataset) to compare mapping patterns, ii) applying the method to the GoEmotions dataset and iii) comparing human-written text with large language model (LLM) responses to assess differences in inferred brain activation. Emotional intensity was scored via lexical analysis. Results showed neuroanatomically plausible mappings with high spatial specificity. Depressed subjects exhibited greater limbic engagement tied to negative affect. Discrete emotions were successfully differentiated. LLM-generated text matched humans in basic emotion distribution but lacked nuanced activation in empathy and self-referential regions (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex). This cost-effective, scalable approach enables large-scale analysis of naturalistic language, distinguishes between clinical populations, and offers a brain-based benchmark for evaluating AI emotional expression.

  Effective tool use is essential for large language models (LLMs) to interact meaningfully with their environment. However, progress is limited by the lack of efficient reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks specifically designed for tool use, due to challenges in constructing stable training environments and designing verifiable reward mechanisms. To address this, we propose an automated environment construction pipeline, incorporating scenario decomposition, document generation, function integration, complexity scaling, and localized deployment. This enables the creation of high-quality training environments that provide detailed and measurable feedback without relying on external tools. Additionally, we introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that evaluates both the precision of tool use and the completeness of task execution. When combined with trajectory data collected from the constructed environments, this mechanism integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms to facilitate feedback-driven model training. Experiments on LLMs of varying scales demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the models' tool-use performance without degrading their general capabilities, regardless of inference modes or training algorithms. Our analysis suggests that these gains result from improved context understanding and reasoning, driven by updates to the lower-layer MLP parameters in models.

  Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking "Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and 230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Humour, as a complex language form, is derived from myriad aspects of life. Whilst existing work on computational humour has focussed almost exclusively on short pun-based jokes, we investigate whether the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular form. We compare models' joke explanation abilities from simple puns to complex topical humour that requires esoteric knowledge of real-world entities and events. To this end, we curate a dataset of 600 jokes across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality explanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns, contemporary internet humour, and topical jokes. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot abilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of different types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour explanation. We find that none of the tested models (including reasoning models) are capable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further highlighting the narrow focus of most existing works on overly simple joke forms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Language models deployed in real-world systems often require post-hoc updates to incorporate new or corrected knowledge. However, editing such models efficiently and reliably-without retraining or forgetting previous information-remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks for LLaMA-3 and Mistral backbones demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. However, existing research has overlooked the efficiency of TTS from a latency-sensitive perspective. Through a latency-aware evaluation of representative TTS methods, we demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS does not always result in the lowest latency in scenarios where latency is critical. To address this gap and achieve latency-optimal TTS, we propose two key approaches by optimizing the concurrency configurations: (1) branch-wise parallelism, which leverages multiple concurrent inference branches, and (2) sequence-wise parallelism, enabled by speculative decoding. By integrating these two approaches and allocating computational resources properly to each, our latency-optimal TTS enables a 32B model to reach 82.3% accuracy on MATH-500 within 1 minute and a smaller 3B model to achieve 72.4% within 10 seconds. Our work emphasizes the importance of latency-aware TTS and demonstrates its ability to deliver both speed and accuracy in latency-sensitive scenarios.

  Enhancing the linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to include low-resource languages is a critical research area. Current research directions predominantly rely on synthetic data generated by translating English corpora, which, while demonstrating promising linguistic understanding and translation abilities, often results in models aligned with source language culture. These models frequently fail to represent the cultural heritage and values of local communities. This work proposes a methodology to create both synthetic and retrieval-based pre-training data tailored to a specific community, considering its (i) language, (ii) cultural heritage, and (iii) cultural values. We demonstrate our methodology using Egyptian and Moroccan dialects as testbeds, chosen for their linguistic and cultural richness and current underrepresentation in LLMs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop NileChat, a 3B parameter LLM adapted for Egyptian and Moroccan communities, incorporating their language, cultural heritage, and values. Our results on various understanding, translation, and cultural and values alignment benchmarks show that NileChat outperforms existing Arabic-aware LLMs of similar size and performs on par with larger models. We share our methods, data, and models with the community to promote the inclusion and coverage of more diverse communities in LLM development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise, necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error. We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification (LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses, human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR for label correction. Code is available atthis https URL.

  _Zahraa Al Sahili, Ioannis Patras, Matthew Purver_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multilingual vision-language models (VLMs) promise universal image-text retrieval, yet their social biases remain underexplored. We perform the first systematic audit of four public multilingual CLIP variants: M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, CAPIVARA-CLIP, and the debiased SigLIP-2, covering ten languages that differ in resource availability and morphological gender marking. Using balanced subsets of FairFace and the PATA stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the intuition that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender skew than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared encoder of NLLB-CLIP and SigLIP-2 transfers English gender stereotypes into gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this leakage. Although SigLIP-2 reduces agency and communion skews, it inherits -- and in caption-sparse contexts (e.g., Xhosa) amplifies -- the English anchor's crime associations. Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all bias types, yet gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable whenever cross-lingual weight sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics thus mask language-specific hot spots, underscoring the need for fine-grained, language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual VLM research.

  Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models. The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa, involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering, summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.

  Generation capabilities and language coverage of multilingual large language models (mLLMs) are advancing rapidly. However, evaluation practices for generative abilities of mLLMs are still lacking comprehensiveness, scientific rigor, and consistent adoption across research labs, which undermines their potential to meaningfully guide mLLM development. We draw parallels with machine translation (MT) evaluation, a field that faced similar challenges and has, over decades, developed transparent reporting standards and reliable evaluations for multilingual generative models. Through targeted experiments across key stages of the generative evaluation pipeline, we demonstrate how best practices from MT evaluation can deepen the understanding of quality differences between models. Additionally, we identify essential components for robust meta-evaluation of mLLMs, ensuring the evaluation methods themselves are rigorously assessed. We distill these insights into a checklist of actionable recommendations for mLLM research and development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens and current structural constraints motivate changes to existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokens and pretraining can act as a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being arguably meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.

  In this work, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of a two-stage pipeline to evaluate literary machine translation, in a fine-grained manner, from English to Korean. The results show that our framework provides fine-grained, interpretable metrics suited for literary translation and obtains a higher correlation with human judgment than traditional machine translation metrics. Nonetheless, it still fails to match inter-human agreement, especially in metrics like Korean Honorifics. We also observe that LLMs tend to favor translations generated by other LLMs, and we highlight the necessity of developing more sophisticated evaluation methods to ensure accurate and culturally sensitive machine translation of literary works.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling specialized tasks, including medical problem-solving. However, most studies predominantly focus on English-language contexts. This study introduces a novel benchmark dataset based on Polish medical licensing and specialization exams (LEK, LDEK, PES) taken by medical doctor candidates and practicing doctors pursuing specialization. The dataset was web-scraped from publicly available resources provided by the Medical Examination Center and the Chief Medical Chamber. It comprises over 24,000 exam questions, including a subset of parallel Polish-English corpora, where the English portion was professionally translated by the examination center for foreign candidates. By creating a structured benchmark from these existing exam questions, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including general-purpose, domain-specific, and Polish-specific models, and compare their performance against human medical students. Our analysis reveals that while models like GPT-4o achieve near-human performance, significant challenges persist in cross-lingual translation and domain-specific understanding. These findings underscore disparities in model performance across languages and medical specialties, highlighting the limitations and ethical considerations of deploying LLMs in clinical practice.

  NLP benchmarks rely on standardized datasets for training and evaluating models and are crucial for advancing the field. Traditionally, expert annotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation does not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by modern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often comes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance the annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing datasets. In this work, we consider the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge, leveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. We conduct a case study on four factual consistency datasets from the TRUE benchmark, spanning diverse NLP tasks, and on SummEval, which uses Likert-scale ratings of summary quality across multiple dimensions. We empirically analyze the labeling quality of existing datasets and compare expert, crowd-sourced, and LLM-based annotations in terms of the agreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each annotation method. Our findings reveal a substantial number of label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in reported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs' so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve performance.

  Attributed Question Answering (AQA) aims to provide both a trustworthy answer and a reliable attribution report for a given question. Retrieval is a widely adopted approach, including two general paradigms: Retrieval-Then-Read (RTR) and post-hoc retrieval. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency, prompting growing interest in AQA among researchers. However, RTR-based AQA often suffers from irrelevant knowledge and rapidly changing information, even when LLMs are adopted, while post-hoc retrieval-based AQA struggles with comprehending long-form answers with complex logic, and precisely identifying the content needing revision and preserving the original intent. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an Atomic fact decomposition-based Retrieval and Editing (ARE) framework, which decomposes the generated long-form answers into molecular clauses and atomic facts by the instruction-tuned LLMs. Notably, the instruction-tuned LLMs are fine-tuned using a well-constructed dataset, generated from large scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This process involves extracting one-hop neighbors from a given set of entities and transforming the result into coherent long-form text. Subsequently, ARE leverages a search engine to retrieve evidences related to atomic facts, inputting these evidences into an LLM-based verifier to determine whether the facts require expansion for re-retrieval or editing. Furthermore, the edited facts are backtracked into the original answer, with evidence aggregated based on the relationship between molecular clauses and atomic facts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts on several datasets, with an additionally proposed new metric $Attr_{p}$ for evaluating the precision of evidence attribution.

  Auto-evaluation is crucial for assessing response quality and offering feedback for model development. Recent studies have explored training large language models (LLMs) as generative judges to evaluate and critique other models' outputs. In this work, we investigate the idea of learning from both positive and negative data with preference optimization to enhance the evaluation capabilities of LLM judges across an array of different use cases. We achieve this by employing three approaches to collect the preference pairs for different use cases, each aimed at improving our generative judge from a different perspective. Our comprehensive study over a wide range of benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our generative judge achieves the best performance on 10 out of 13 benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-4o and specialized judge models. Further analysis show that our judge model robustly counters inherent biases such as position and length bias, flexibly adapts to any evaluation protocol specified by practitioners, and provides helpful language feedback for improving downstream generator models.

  Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.

  Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis, and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction. Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its capacity for robust performance across clinical applications.

  Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers. Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this, we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the \textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space. Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

  Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged, providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES, where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

  Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC. While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing surveys still suffer from limitations: lack of systematic classification linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key contributions. First, it introduces a novel taxonomy classifying CVQE methods across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE research and deployment.

  Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

  Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently. Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters, and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:this https URL.

  Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description, without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt. Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while remaining imperceptible.

  Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension, answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos, caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we review representative works across the key areas of research on modern general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally, we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising directions for future research.

  Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs, adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open mammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets under different settings.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation. While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed, less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE. Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better preserves fine anatomical details.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling, ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to 3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably, even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently, feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing the original model by 0.51%. The code is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations. Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information, such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre, demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The implementation of the algorithm will be made available in the GitHub repositorythis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in computer vision but are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Standard defenses often incur high computational cost or lack formal guarantees. We propose a Lipschitz-guided stochastic depth (DropPath) method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers, improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost. However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images, and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D anomaly detection.

  Recent works have shown the effectiveness of Large Vision Language Models (VLMs or LVLMs) in image manipulation detection. However, text manipulation detection is largely missing in these studies. We bridge this knowledge gap by analyzing closed- and open-source VLMs on different text manipulation datasets. Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models, most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from 24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias. This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved performance in object removal.

  Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance - particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study, we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to 140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%) across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced volumetric variability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse, detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance. Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and representation efficiency in space scenarios.

  We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach, LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

  Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust, scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable: it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID, highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong autoregressive image generation.

  Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However, segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage, salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism, enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy and improved boundary delineation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions. While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency. Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference stage. The code will be released.

  Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2, with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss), combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

  We introduce VARCO-VISION-2.0, an open-weight bilingual vision-language model (VLM) for Korean and English with improved capabilities compared to the previous model VARCO-VISION-14B. The model supports multi-image understanding for complex inputs such as documents, charts, and tables, and delivers layoutaware OCR by predicting both textual content and its spatial location. Trained with a four-stage curriculum with memory-efficient techniques, the model achieves enhanced multimodal alignment, while preserving core language abilities and improving safety via preference optimization. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate strong spatial grounding and competitive results for both languages, with the 14B model achieving 8th place on the OpenCompass VLM leaderboard among models of comparable scale. Alongside the 14B-scale model, we release a 1.7B version optimized for on-device deployment. We believe these models advance the development of bilingual VLMs and their practical applications. Two variants of VARCO-VISION-2.0 are available at Hugging Face: a full-scale 14B model and a lightweight 1.7B model.

  Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while associating each part to the person it belongs to, combining instance-level and part-level information for fine-grained human understanding. In this work, we demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process, introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\% relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However, pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built maps.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mathematical reasoning is critical for tasks such as precise distance and area computations, trajectory estimations, and spatial analysis in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) have not been adequately tested in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic, and algebra. The dataset comprises 3,773 high-quality vehicle-related questions captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose the limitations of VLMs in mathematical reasoning but also offer valuable insights for advancing UAV-based trustworthy VLMs in real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g., Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation, reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring additional training or external reference images. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

  _Jing Huang, Zhiya Tan, Shutao Gong, Fanwei Zeng, Jianshu Li_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment. Our code is available at this link: \href{this https URL}

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed, incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively.

  This paper proposes a novel model of few-part-shot font generation, which designs an entire font based on a set of partial design elements, i.e., partial shapes. Unlike conventional few-shot font generation, which requires entire character shapes for a couple of character classes, our approach only needs partial shapes as input. The proposed model not only improves the efficiency of font creation but also provides insights into how partial design details influence the entire structure of the individual characters.

  _Xiaodong Guo, Tong Liu, Yike Li, Zi'ang Lin, Zhihong Deng_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI, with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB, PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile, it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture, highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion. Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced visual media restoration and enhancement.

  _Anne Marthe Sophie Ngo Bibinbe, Chiron Bang, Patrick Gagnon, Jamie Ahloy-Dallaire, Eric R. Paquet_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:this https URL

  _Tianqi Wei, Xin Yu, Zhi Chen, Scott Chapman, Zi Huang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper, we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance, offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation problems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG. Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

  Multi-Target Multi-Camera Tracking (MTMC) is an essential computer vision task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However, tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the 2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the leaderboard.

  Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain. Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features. However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

  The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications, such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third (tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from 0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert decision-making in forensic age estimation.

  Objective: Deep learning-based deformable image registration has achieved strong accuracy, but remains sensitive to variations in input image characteristics such as artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, or modality difference. We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration, mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results: Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data. Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

  We introduce a multi-modal WAVE-DETR drone detector combining visible RGB and acoustic signals for robust real-life UAV object detection. Our approach fuses visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under challenging environmental conditions. Our work leverage the existing Drone-vs-Bird dataset and the newly generated ARDrone dataset containing more than 7,500 synchronized images and audio segments. We show how the acoustic information is used to improve the performance of the Deformable DETR object detector on the real ARDrone dataset. We developed, trained and tested four different fusion configurations based on a gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP and cross attention. The Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings are fused with the multi resolution feature mappings of the Deformable DETR and enhance the object detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by 11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9. The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.

  To rigorously assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components within the recently proposed ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking, this paper presents a comprehensive ablation study. The ULW approach combines a U-Net based backbone with a compound loss function that comprises mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) loss, and perceptual loss. The framework also incorporates a differentiable, learnable Wiener filter module. In this study, each component is systematically ablated to evaluate its specific contribution to the overall performance of the whole framework. The analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative visual comparisons.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules, and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper. Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score when evaluated using the real-world test data. The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data and clinical priors can jointly enable accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems, especially for privacy sensitive applications in telemedicine and large-scale screening.

  Rosacea, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that manifests with facial redness, papules, and visible blood vessels, often requirs precise and early detection for significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This paper presents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the ResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies come from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted from the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations. Second, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the localized visual information influences the deep learing model performance. Third, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy and sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed patch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve patient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies guide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance robustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the proposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated dermatological diagnostics.

  Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses. State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code and models will be available atthis https URL

  _Judith Massmann, Alexander Lichtenstein, Francisco M. L√≥pez_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Numerous visual impairments can be detected in red-eye reflex images from young children. The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by ophthalmologists in clinical settings. Thanks to the recent technological advances in smartphones and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to recreate the Bruckner test using a mobile device. In this paper, we present a first study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free application that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using red-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks trained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist. With an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable performance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can identify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used to provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for vision abnormalities worldwide.

- **[Fine-Grained Cross-View Localization via Local Feature Matching and Monocular Depth Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09792)**  `arXiv:2509.09792`  
  _Zimin Xia, Chenghao Xu, Alexandre Alahi_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably, modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance, makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.

  _Moslem Yazdanpanah, Ali Bahri, Mehrdad Noori, Sahar Dastani, Gustavo Adolfo Vargas Hakim, David Osowiechi, et al._
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work, we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP, which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of +10.3\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods, while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is 12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at \hyperlink{this https URL}{this https URL}

  _Hossein Yazdanjouei, Arash Mansouri, Mohammad Shokouhifar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This study proposes a semi-supervised co-training framework for object detection in densely packed retail environments, where limited labeled data and complex conditions pose major challenges. The framework combines Faster R-CNN (utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness. Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) allows multiple entities to train a shared model collaboratively. Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL. While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data, their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further investigation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction, involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data, corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive improvements.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision language models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot visual classification, but their performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces is understudied. This paper investigates whether structured, tree-based reasoning can enhance VLM performance. We introduce a framework that decomposes classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees and evaluates it on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Although the model achieves 98.2% accuracy in understanding the tree knowledge, tree-based reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting. We also explore enhancing the tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image descriptions to improve alignment. The added description enhances the performance of the tree-based and zero-shot methods. Our findings highlight limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offer insights for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes 170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions. Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications. Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905 (+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to 0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to advance both ITS and LMM research.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622 Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases. The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document collections and transcription models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by 9.6%.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for real-world manga applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures, which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies. Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures, suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception (PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety. In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet), which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features, while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise. We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

  _Wenjie Zhu, Yabin Zhang, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng, Lei Zhang_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.

  As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning modelthis http URLcode can be found atthis https URL.

  We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise, and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image without inducing any perceptible visual alterations. Through experiments conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

  Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na√Øve fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling, DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones, including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27 FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration, streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However, replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore, detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of compressed video content.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

  Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To tackle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception information without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we incorporate geometry and perception priors to initialize the Gaussian branches and guide their parameter optimization. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we introduce a stable Score Distillation Sampling for fine-grained prior distillation to ensure effective knowledge transfer. The model is further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experimental results show that we outperform existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.

  Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data, with the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation alone producing approximately 1.6TB per day. To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures.We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Text-to-image models are powerful for producing high-quality images based on given text prompts, but crafting these prompts often requires specialized vocabulary. To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt, and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards, i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong competitors.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fine-grained object counting remains a major challenge for class-agnostic counting models, which overcount visually similar but incorrect instances (e.g., jalape√±o vs. poblano). Addressing this by annotating new data and fully retraining the model is time-consuming and does not guarantee generalization to additional novel categories at test time. Instead, we propose an alternative paradigm: Given a category name, tune a compact concept embedding derived from the prompt using synthetic images and pseudo-labels generated by a text-to-image diffusion model. This embedding conditions a specialization module that refines raw overcounts from any frozen counter into accurate, category-specific estimates\textemdash without requiring real images or human annotations. We validate our approach on \textsc{Lookalikes}, a challenging new benchmark containing 1,037 images across 27 fine-grained subcategories, and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.

  Medical image analysis is essential in modern healthcare. Deep learning has redirected research focus toward complex medical multimodal tasks, including report generation and visual question answering. Traditional task-specific models often fall short in handling these challenges. Large vision-language models (LVLMs) offer new solutions for solving such tasks. In this study, we build on the popular LLaVA framework to systematically explore model architectures and training strategies for both 2D and 3D medical LVLMs. We present extensive empirical findings and practical guidance. To support reproducibility and future research, we release a modular codebase, MedM-VL, and two pre-trained models: MedM-VL-2D for 2D medical image analysis and MedM-VL-CT-Chest for 3D CT-based applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Learning open-vocabulary physical skills for simulated agents presents a significant challenge in artificial intelligence. Current reinforcement learning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack scalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a generalized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill learning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key insight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs) provide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints capturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and naturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback continuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving reward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images, we develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent poses directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning paradigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion naturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster than previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable physical skill acquisition in simulated environments.

  Text-guided motion editing enables high-level semantic control and iterative modifications beyond traditional keyframe animation. Existing methods rely on limited pre-collected training triplets, which severely hinders their versatility in diverse editing scenarios. We introduce MotionCutMix, an online data augmentation technique that dynamically generates training triplets by blending body part motions based on input text. While MotionCutMix effectively expands the training distribution, the compositional nature introduces increased randomness and potential body part incoordination. To model such a rich distribution, we present MotionReFit, an auto-regressive diffusion model with a motion coordinator. The auto-regressive architecture facilitates learning by decomposing long sequences, while the motion coordinator mitigates the artifacts of motion composition. Our method handles both spatial and temporal motion edits directly from high-level human instructions, without relying on additional specifications or Large Language Models. Through extensive experiments, we show that MotionReFit achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-guided motion editing.

  Recently, action-based decision-making in open-world environments has gained significant attention. Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found inthis https URL.

  Embodied outdoor scene understanding forms the foundation for autonomous agents to perceive, analyze, and react to dynamic driving environments. However, existing 3D understanding is predominantly based on 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which collect and process limited scene-aware contexts. In contrast, compared to the 2D planar visual information, point cloud sensors such as LiDAR provide rich depth and fine-grained 3D representations of objects. Even better the emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar detects the motion trend, velocity, and reflection intensity of each object. The integration of these two modalities provides more flexible querying conditions for natural language, thereby supporting more accurate 3D visual grounding. To this end, we propose a novel method called TPCNet, the first outdoor 3D visual grounding model upon the paradigm of prompt-guided point cloud sensor combination, including both LiDAR and radar sensors. To optimally combine the features of these two sensors required by the prompt, we design a multi-fusion paradigm called Two-Stage Heterogeneous Modal Adaptive Fusion. Specifically, this paradigm initially employs Bidirectional Agent Cross-Attention (BACA), which feeds both-sensor features, characterized by global receptive fields, to the text features for querying. Moreover, we design a Dynamic Gated Graph Fusion (DGGF) module to locate the regions of interest identified by the queries. To further enhance accuracy, we devise an C3D-RECHead, based on the nearest object edge to the ego-vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate that our TPCNet, along with its individual modules, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the Talk2Radar and Talk2Car datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at:this https URL.

  Object affordance reasoning, the ability to infer object functionalities based on physical properties, is fundamental for task-oriented planning and activities in both humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This capability, required for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner, relies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities, extending beyond simple object recognition. Current computational models for affordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their applicability in novel scenarios. Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a large-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance the generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. Utilizing this dataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning model that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve multi-modal understanding. This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance improvement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also demonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper. Additionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50 times faster than the GPT-4V API. Our work demonstrates the potential for efficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. We showcase Afford-X's effectiveness in enabling task-oriented manipulations for robots across various tasks and environments, underscoring its efficiency and broad implications for advancing robotics and AI systems in real-world applications.

  Estimating the construction year of buildings is critical for advancing sustainability, as older structures often lack energy-efficient features. Sustainable urban planning relies on accurate building age data to reduce energy consumption and mitigate climate change. In this work, we introduce MapYourCity, a novel multi-modal benchmark dataset comprising top-view Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery, multi-spectral Earth Observation (EO) data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation, and co-localized street-view images across various European cities. Each building is labeled with its construction epoch, and the task is formulated as a seven-class classification problem covering periods from 1900 to the present. To advance research in EO generalization and multi-modal learning, we organized a community-driven data challenge in 2024, hosted by ESA $\Phi$-lab, which ran for four months and attracted wide participation.This paper presents the Top-4 performing models from the challenge and their evaluation results. We assess model generalization on cities excluded from training to prevent data leakage, and evaluate performance under missing modality scenarios, particularly when street-view data is unavailable. Results demonstrate that building age estimation is both feasible and effective, even in previously unseen cities and when relying solely on top-view satellite imagery (i.e. with VHR and Sentinel-2 images). The MapYourCity dataset thus provides a valuable resource for developing scalable, real-world solutions in sustainable urban analytics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Soft prompt learning methods are effective for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Nevertheless, empirical evidence reveals a tendency of existing methods that they overfit seen classes and exhibit degraded performance on unseen classes. This limitation is due to the inherent bias in the training data towards the seen classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel soft prompt learning method, named Mixture-of-Prompts Distillation (MoPD), which can effectively transfer useful knowledge from hard prompts manually hand-crafted (a.k.a. teacher prompts) to the learnable soft prompt (a.k.a. student prompt), thereby enhancing the generalization ability of soft prompts on unseen classes. Moreover, the proposed MoPD method utilizes a gating network that learns to select hard prompts used for prompt distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoPD method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines especially on on unseen classes.

  Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the quality of image synthesis, yet they have also introduced serious safety concerns, particularly the generation of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content. Previous research has demonstrated that adversarial prompts can be used to generate NSFW content. However, such adversarial text prompts are often easily detectable by text-based filters, limiting their efficacy. In this paper, we expose a previously overlooked vulnerability: adversarial image attacks targeting Image-to-Image (I2I) diffusion models. We propose AdvI2I, a novel framework that manipulates input images to induce diffusion models to generate NSFW content. By optimizing a generator to craft adversarial images, AdvI2I circumvents existing defense mechanisms, such as Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD), without altering the text prompts. Furthermore, we introduce AdvI2I-Adaptive, an enhanced version that adapts to potential countermeasures and minimizes the resemblance between adversarial images and NSFW concept embeddings, making the attack more resilient against defenses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both AdvI2I and AdvI2I-Adaptive can effectively bypass current safeguards, highlighting the urgent need for stronger security measures to address the misuse of I2I diffusion models.

  Diffusion models, which can be viewed as a special case of hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), have shown profound success in generating photo-realistic images. In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.

  Skeleton-based action recognition has achieved remarkable results in human action recognition with the development of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). However, the recent works tend to construct complex learning mechanisms with redundant training and exist a bottleneck for long time-series. To solve these problems, we propose the Temporal-Spatio Graph ConvNeXt (TSGCNeXt) to explore efficient learning mechanism of long temporal skeleton sequences. Firstly, a new graph learning mechanism with simple structure, Dynamic-Static Separate Multi-graph Convolution (DS-SMG) is proposed to aggregate features of multiple independent topological graphs and avoid the node information being ignored during dynamic convolution. Next, we construct a graph convolution training acceleration mechanism to optimize the back-propagation computing of dynamic graph learning with 55.08\% speed-up. Finally, the TSGCNeXt restructure the overall structure of GCN with three Spatio-temporal learning modules,efficiently modeling long temporal features. In comparison with existing previous methods on large-scale datasets NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, TSGCNeXt outperforms on single-stream networks. In addition, with the ema model introduced into the multi-stream fusion, TSGCNeXt achieves SOTA levels. On the cross-subject and cross-set of the NTU 120, accuracies reach 90.22% and 91.74%.

  The objective of this paper is to assess the quality of explanation heatmaps for image classification tasks. To assess the quality of explainability methods, we approach the task through the lens of accuracy and stability.In this work, we make the following contributions. Firstly, we introduce the Weighting Game, which measures how much of a class-guided explanation is contained within the correct class' segmentation mask. Secondly, we introduce a metric for explanation stability, using zooming/panning transformations to measure differences between saliency maps with similar contents.Quantitative experiments are produced, using these new metrics, to evaluate the quality of explanations provided by commonly used CAM methods. The quality of explanations is also contrasted between different model architectures, with findings highlighting the need to consider model architecture when choosing an explainability method.

  Ensuring the resilience of computer-based railways is increasingly crucial to account for uncertainties and changes due to the growing complexity and criticality of those systems. Although their software relies on strict verification and validation processes following well-established best-practices and certification standards, anomalies can still occur at run-time due to residual faults, system and environmental modifications that were unknown at design-time, or other emergent cyber-threat scenarios. This paper explores run-time control-flow anomaly detection using process mining to enhance the resilience of ERTMS/ETCS L2 (European Rail Traffic Management System / European Train Control System Level 2). Process mining allows learning the actual control flow of the system from its execution traces, thus enabling run-time monitoring through online conformance checking. In addition, anomaly localization is performed through unsupervised machine learning to link relevant deviations to critical system components. We test our approach on a reference ERTMS/ETCS L2 scenario, namely the RBC/RBC Handover, to show its capability to detect and localize anomalies with high accuracy, efficiency, and explainability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present Multipole Semantic Attention (MuSe), an efficient approximation of softmax attention that combines semantic clustering with multipole expansions from computational physics. Our method addresses the quadratic computational complexity of transformers in the context length by clustering queries and keys separately in their learned representation spaces, enabling a hierarchical two-stage attention mechanism. Unlike prior clustering approaches that group only keys or use unified clustering, we maintain separate clusterings that respect attention's asymmetric treatment of these spaces. We augment centroid-based (monopole) approximations with dipole corrections that capture directional variance within clusters, preserving richer information during training. The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention, requiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural modifications. Our approach achieves $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal attention with $C$ clusters and $\mathcal{O}(NCD \log N)$ for causal attention. On isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash Attention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For causal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines exact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end pretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we achieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing the viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer pretraining.

  Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as promising alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, offering competitive performance while supporting unique generation capabilities such as inpainting. We explore how inpainting can inform RL algorithm design for dLLMs. Aligning LLMs with reinforcement learning faces an exploration challenge: sparse reward signals and sample waste when models fail to discover correct solutions. While this inefficiency affects LLMs broadly, dLLMs offer a distinctive opportunity--their inpainting ability can guide exploration. We introduce IGPO (Inpainting Guided Policy Optimization), an RL framework that strategically inserts partial ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling. Unlike providing full solutions, inpainting steers exploration toward promising trajectory spaces while preserving self-generated reasoning, bridging supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We apply IGPO to group-based optimization methods such as GRPO, where exploration failures cause zero advantages and gradients. IGPO restores meaningful gradients while improving sample efficiency. We also propose supervised fine-tuning on synthetically rewritten concise traces that better align with dLLM generation patterns. With additional techniques including entropy-based filtering, our training recipe yields substantial gains across three mathematical benchmarks--GSM8K, Math500, and AMC--achieving new state-of-the-art results for full-attention masked dLLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Given a dataset of finitely many elements $\mathcal{T} = \{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i = 1}^N$, the goal of dataset condensation (DC) is to construct a synthetic dataset $\mathcal{S} = \{\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_j\}_{j = 1}^M$ which is significantly smaller ($M \ll N$) such that a model trained from scratch on $\mathcal{S}$ achieves comparable or even superior generalization performance to a model trained on $\mathcal{T}$. Recent advances in DC reveal a close connection to the problem of approximating the data distribution represented by $\mathcal{T}$ with a reduced set of points. In this work, we present a unified framework that encompasses existing DC methods and extend the task-specific notion of DC to a more general and formal definition using notions of discrepancy, which quantify the distance between probability distribution in different regimes. Our framework broadens the objective of DC beyond generalization, accommodating additional objectives such as robustness, privacy, and other desirable properties.

  This paper proposes a simple yet effective convolutional module for long-term time series forecasting. The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings. Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore, analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for positional embeddings in sequential models.

While numerous efforts have substantially advanced the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable insights into localized spatiotemporal auditing and sustainable strategies for post-disaster risk reduction.

  The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), are canonical combinatorial optimization problems with wide-ranging applications in industrial operations. In recent years, many online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20 training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority dispatching rules.

  _Sahil Sethi, Kai Sundmacher, Caroline Ganzer_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as versatile replacements for traditional solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first, pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity, surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

  _Zexu Jin_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Ensemble learning has been widely recognized as a pivotal technique for boosting predictive performance by combining multiple base models. Nevertheless, conventional margin-based ensemble methods predominantly focus on maximizing the expected margin while neglecting the critical role of margin variance, which inherently restricts the generalization capability of the model and heightens its vulnerability to overfitting, particularly in noisy or imbalanced datasets. Additionally, the conventional approach of optimizing ensemble weights within the probability simplex often introduces computational inefficiency and scalability challenges, complicating its application to large-scale problems. To tackle these limitations, this paper introduces a novel ensemble learning framework that explicitly incorporates margin variance into the loss function. Our method jointly optimizes the negative expected margin and its variance, leading to enhanced robustness and improved generalization performance. Moreover, by reparameterizing the ensemble weights onto the unit sphere, we substantially simplify the optimization process and improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional margin-based ensemble techniques, underscoring its effectiveness and practical utility.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a scalable framework for learning deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates for high-resolution 3D physics simulations. We introduce a hybrid CNN-Transformer backbone architecture targeted for 3D physics simulations, which significantly outperforms existing architectures in terms of speed and accuracy. Our proposed network can be pretrained on small patches of the simulation domain, which can be fused to obtain a global solution, optionally guided via a fast and scalable sequence-to-sequence model to include long-range dependencies. This setup allows for training large-scale models with reduced memory and compute requirements for high-resolution datasets. We evaluate our backbone architecture against a large set of baseline methods with the objective to simultaneously learn the dynamics of 14 different types of PDEs in 3D. We demonstrate how to scale our model to high-resolution isotropic turbulence with spatial resolutions of up to $512^3$. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our network by training it as a diffusion model to produce probabilistic samples of highly turbulent 3D channel flows across varying Reynolds numbers, accurately capturing the underlying flow statistics.

  _L√©na√Øc Chizat_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the gradient-based training of large-depth residual networks (ResNets) from standard random initializations. We show that with a diverging depth $L$, a fixed embedding dimension $D$, and an arbitrary hidden width $M$, the training dynamics converges to a Neural Mean ODE training dynamics. Remarkably, the limit is independent of the scaling of $M$, covering practical cases of, say, Transformers, where $M$ (the number of hidden units or attention heads per layer) is typically of the order of $D$. For a residual scale $\Theta_D\big(\frac{\alpha}{LM}\big)$, we obtain the error bound $O_D\big(\frac{1}{L}+ \frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{LM}}\big)$ between the model's output and its limit after a fixed number gradient of steps, and we verify empirically that this rate is tight. When $\alpha=\Theta(1)$, the limit exhibits complete feature learning, i.e. the Mean ODE is genuinely non-linearly parameterized. In contrast, we show that $\alpha \to \infty$ yields a \lazy ODE regime where the Mean ODE is linearly parameterized. We then focus on the particular case of ResNets with two-layer perceptron blocks, for which we study how these scalings depend on the embedding dimension $D$. We show that for this model, the only residual scale that leads to complete feature learning is $\Theta\big(\frac{\sqrt{D}}{LM}\big)$. In this regime, we prove the error bound $O\big(\frac{1}{L}+ \frac{\sqrt{D}}{\sqrt{LM}}\big)$ between the ResNet and its limit after a fixed number of gradient steps, which is also empirically tight. Our convergence results rely on a novel mathematical perspective on ResNets : (i) due to the randomness of the initialization, the forward and backward pass through the ResNet behave as the stochastic approximation of certain mean ODEs, and (ii) by propagation of chaos (that is, asymptotic independence of the units) this behavior is preserved through the training dynamics.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are inexpensive, widely used, and well-suited to deep learning. Recently, interest has grown in developing foundation models for ECGs - models that generalise across diverse downstream tasks. However, consistent evaluation has been lacking: prior work often uses narrow task selections and inconsistent datasets, hindering fair comparison. Here, we introduce BenchECG, a standardised benchmark comprising a comprehensive suite of publicly available ECG datasets and versatile tasks. We also propose xECG, an xLSTM-based recurrent model trained with SimDINOv2 self-supervised learning, which achieves the best BenchECG score compared to publicly available state-of-the-art models. In particular, xECG is the only publicly available model to perform strongly on all datasets and tasks. By standardising evaluation, BenchECG enables rigorous comparison and aims to accelerate progress in ECG representation learning. xECG achieves superior performance over earlier approaches, defining a new baseline for future ECG foundation models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) combines uncertainty modeling with decentralized training, enabling the development of personalized and reliable models under data heterogeneity and privacy constraints. Existing approaches typically rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or variational inference, often incorporating personalization mechanisms to better adapt to local data distributions. In this work, we propose an information-geometric projection framework for personalization in parametric BFL. By projecting the global model onto a neighborhood of the user's local model, our method enables a tunable trade-off between global generalization and local specialization. Under mild assumptions, we show that this projection step is equivalent to computing a barycenter on the statistical manifold, allowing us to derive closed-form solutions and achieve cost-free personalization. We apply the proposed approach to a variational learning setup using the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer and extend its application to general aggregation schemes in BFL. Empirical evaluations under heterogeneous data distributions confirm that our method effectively balances global and local performance with minimal computational overhead.

  We introduce a novel symbolic regression framework, namely KAN-SR, built on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) which follows a divide-and-conquer approach. Symbolic regression searches for mathematical equations that best fit a given dataset and is commonly solved with genetic programming approaches. We show that by using deep learning techniques, more specific KANs, and combining them with simplification strategies such as translational symmetries and separabilities, we are able to recover ground-truth equations of the Feynman Symbolic Regression for Scientific Discovery (SRSD) dataset. Additionally, we show that by combining the proposed framework with neural controlled differential equations, we are able to model the dynamics of an in-silico bioprocess system precisely, opening the door for the dynamic modeling of other engineering systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Predictive models are being increasingly used across a wide range of domains, including safety-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and criminal justice. Reliable uncertainty estimation is a crucial task in such settings. Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a recently proposed machine learning foundation model for tabular dataset, which uses a generative transformer architecture. Variational Bayesian Last Layers (VBLL) is a state-of-the-art lightweight variational formulation that effectively improves uncertainty estimation with minimal computational overhead. In this work we aim to evaluate the performance of VBLL integrated with the recently proposed TabPFN in uncertainty calibration. Our experiments, conducted on three benchmark medical tabular datasets, compare the performance of the original TabPFN and the VBLL-integrated version. Contrary to expectations, we observed that original TabPFN consistently outperforms VBLL integrated TabPFN in uncertainty calibration across all datasets.

  _Mohammad Hasan Narimani, Mostafa Tavassolipour_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Federated learning (FL) offers an innovative paradigm for collaborative model training across decentralized devices, such as smartphones, balancing enhanced predictive performance with the protection of user privacy in sensitive areas like Internet of Things (IoT) and medical data analysis. Despite its advantages, FL encounters significant challenges related to user privacy protection against potential attacks and the management of communication costs. This paper introduces a novel federated learning algorithm called FedRP, which integrates random projection techniques with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. This approach enhances privacy by employing random projection to reduce the dimensionality of model parameters prior to their transmission to a central server, reducing the communication cost. The proposed algorithm offers a strong $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee, demonstrating resilience against data reconstruction attacks. Experimental results reveal that FedRP not only maintains high model accuracy but also outperforms existing methods, including conventional differential privacy approaches and FedADMM, in terms of both privacy preservation and communication efficiency.

  _Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present a formal and constructive theory showing that probabilistic finite automata (PFAs) can be exactly simulated using symbolic feedforward neural networks. Our architecture represents state distributions as vectors and transitions as stochastic matrices, enabling probabilistic state propagation via matrix-vector products. This yields a parallel, interpretable, and differentiable simulation of PFA dynamics using soft updates-without recurrence. We formally characterize probabilistic subset construction, $\varepsilon$-closure, and exact simulation via layered symbolic computation, and prove equivalence between PFAs and specific classes of neural networks. We further show that these symbolic simulators are not only expressive but learnable: trained with standard gradient descent-based optimization on labeled sequence data, they recover the exact behavior of ground-truth PFAs. This learnability, formalized in Proposition 5.1, is the crux of this work. Our results unify probabilistic automata theory with neural architectures under a rigorous algebraic framework, bridging the gap between symbolic computation and deep learning.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand, dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution, called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent. We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality, AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Understanding the internal organization of neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in deep learning interpretability. We address this challenge by exploring a novel Sparse Mixture of Experts Variational Autoencoder (SMoE-VAE) architecture. We test our model on the QuickDraw dataset, comparing unsupervised expert routing against a supervised baseline guided by ground-truth labels. Surprisingly, we find that unsupervised routing consistently achieves superior reconstruction performance. The experts learn to identify meaningful sub-categorical structures that often transcend human-defined class boundaries. Through t-SNE visualizations and reconstruction analysis, we investigate how MoE models uncover fundamental data structures that are more aligned with the model's objective than predefined labels. Furthermore, our study on the impact of dataset size provides insights into the trade-offs between data quantity and expert specialization, offering guidance for designing efficient MoE architectures.

  This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to estimate the energy consumption of virtual servers without access to physical power measurement interfaces. Using resource utilization metrics collected from guest virtual machines, we train a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict energy consumption measured via RAPL on the host. We demonstrate, for the first time, guest-only resource-based energy estimation without privileged host access with experiments across diverse workloads, achieving high predictive accuracy and variance explained ($0.90 \leq R^2 \leq 0.97$), indicating the feasibility of guest-side energy estimation. This approach can enable energy-aware scheduling, cost optimization and physical host independent energy estimates in virtualized environments. Our approach addresses a critical gap in virtualized environments (e.g. cloud) where direct energy measurement is infeasible.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Synthetic tabular data generation is increasingly essential in data management, supporting downstream applications when real-world and high-quality tabular data is insufficient. Existing tabular generation approaches, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), typically require sufficient reference data, limiting their effectiveness in domain-specific databases with scarce records. While prompt-based LLMs offer flexibility without parameter tuning, they often fail to capture dataset-specific feature-label dependencies and generate redundant data, leading to degradation in downstream task performance. To overcome these issues, we propose ReFine, a framework that (i) derives symbolic "if-then" rules from interpretable models and embeds them into prompts to explicitly guide generation toward domain-specific feature distribution, and (ii) applies a dual-granularity filtering strategy that suppresses over-sampling patterns and selectively refines rare but informative samples to reduce distributional imbalance. Extensive experiments on various regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that ReFine consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 0.44 absolute improvement in R-squared for regression and 10.0 percent relative improvement in F1 score for classification tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Though Multimodal Intent Recognition (MIR) proves effective by utilizing rich information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the potential for intent-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities may hinder performance from being further improved. Most current models attempt to fuse modalities by applying mechanisms like multi-head attention to unimodal feature sequences and then adding the result back to the original representation. This process risks corrupting the primary linguistic features with noisy or irrelevant non-verbal signals, as it often fails to capture the fine-grained, token-level influence where non-verbal cues should modulate, not just augment, textual meaning. To address this, we introduce DyKen-Hyena, which reframes the problem from feature fusion to processing modulation. Our model translates audio-visual cues into dynamic, per-token convolutional kernels that directly modulate textual feature extraction. This fine-grained approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks. Notably, it yields a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection, validating that our method creates a fundamentally more robust intent representation.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the combinatorial semi-bandit (CSB) problem, a player selects an action from a combinatorial action set and observes feedback from the base arms included in the action. While CSB is widely applicable to combinatorial optimization problems, its restriction to binary decision spaces excludes important cases involving non-negative integer flows or allocations, such as the optimal transport and knapsackthis http URLovercome this limitation, we propose the multi-play combinatorial semi-bandit (MP-CSB), where a player can select a non-negative integer action and observe multiple feedbacks from a single arm in each round. We propose two algorithms for the MP-CSB. One is a Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that is computationally feasible even when the action space is exponentially large with respect to the number of arms, and attains $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret in the stochastic regime, where $T$ is the time horizon. The other is a best-of-both-worlds algorithm, which achieves $O(\log T)$ variance-dependent regret in the stochastic regime and the worst-case $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ regret in the adversarial regime. Moreover, its regret in adversarial one is data-dependent, adapting to the cumulative loss of the optimal action, the total quadratic variation, and the path-length of the loss sequence. Finally, we numerically show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods in the CSB literature.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

  Much attention has recently been devoted to data-based computing of evolution of physical systems. In such approaches, information about data points from past trajectories in phase space is used to reconstruct the equations of motion and to predict future solutions that have not been observed before. However, in many cases, the available data does not correspond to the variables that define the system's phase space. We focus our attention on the important example of dissipative dynamical systems. In that case, the phase space consists of coordinates, momenta and entropies; however, the momenta and entropies cannot, in general, be observed directly. To address this difficulty, we develop an efficient data-based computing framework based exclusively on observable variables, by constructing a novel approach based on the \emph{thermodynamic Lagrangian}, and constructing neural networks that respect the thermodynamics and guarantees the non-decreasing entropy evolution. We show that our network can provide an efficient description of phase space evolution based on a limited number of data points and a relatively small number of parameters in the system.

  Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful way to improve large language model (LLM) performance by generating multiple candidate responses and selecting among them. However, existing work on dynamic allocation for test-time compute typically considers only parallel generation methods such as best-of-N, overlooking incremental decoding methods like beam search, and has largely ignored latency, focusing only on token usage. We formulate inference-time scaling as a problem of dynamic compute allocation and method selection, where the system must decide which strategy to apply and how much compute to allocate on a per-query basis. Our framework explicitly incorporates both token cost and wall-clock latency, the latter being critical for user experience and particularly for agentic workflows where models must issue multiple queries efficiently. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms static strategies, achieving favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs while remaining practical for deployment.

  This paper presents HGEN that pioneers ensemble learning for heterogeneous graphs. We argue that the heterogeneity in node types, nodal features, and local neighborhood topology poses significant challenges for ensemble learning, particularly in accommodating diverse graph learners. Our HGEN framework ensembles multiple learners through a meta-path and transformation-based optimization pipeline to uplift classification accuracy. Specifically, HGEN uses meta-path combined with random dropping to create Allele Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), whereby the base graph learners are trained and aligned for later ensembling. To ensure effective ensemble learning, HGEN presents two key components: 1) a residual-attention mechanism to calibrate allele GNNs of different meta-paths, thereby enforcing node embeddings to focus on more informative graphs to improve base learner accuracy, and 2) a correlation-regularization term to enlarge the disparity among embedding matrices generated from different meta-paths, thereby enriching base learner diversity. We analyze the convergence of HGEN and attest its higher regularization magnitude over simple voting. Experiments on five heterogeneous networks validate that HGEN consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by substantial margin.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Value-based approaches such as DQN are the default methods for off-policy reinforcement learning with discrete-action environments such as Atari. Common policy-based methods are either on-policy and do not effectively learn from off-policy data (e.g. PPO), or have poor empirical performance in the discrete-action setting (e.g. SAC). Consequently, starting from discrete SAC (DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting. First, we determine that the coupling between the actor and critic entropy is the primary reason behind the poor performance of DSAC. We demonstrate that by merely decoupling these components, DSAC can have comparable performance as DQN. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a flexible off-policy actor-critic framework that subsumes DSAC as a special case. Our framework allows using an m-step Bellman operator for the critic update, and enables combining standard policy optimization methods with entropy regularization to instantiate the resulting actor objective. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods can guarantee convergence to the optimal regularized value function in the tabular setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these methods can approach the performance of DQN on standard Atari games, and do so even without entropy regularization or explicit exploration.

The Plug-and-Play paradigm of optimization algorithms uses off the shelf denoisers to replace a proximity operator or a gradient descent operator of an image prior. Usually this image prior is implicit and cannot be expressed, but the Gradient-Step Denoiser is trained to be exactly the gradient descent operator or the proximity operator of an explicit functional while preserving state-of-the-art denoising capabilities.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) with varying computational costs and performance profiles presents a critical challenge for scalable, cost-effective deployment in real-world applications. We introduce a unified routing framework that leverages a single-head cross-attention mechanism to jointly model query and model embeddings, enabling dynamic selection of the optimal LLM for each input query. Our approach is evaluated on RouterBench, a large-scale, publicly available benchmark encompassing diverse LLM pools and domains. By explicitly capturing fine-grained query-model interactions, our router predicts both response quality and generation cost, achieving up to 6.6% improvement in Average Improvement in Quality (AIQ) and 2.9% in maximum performance over existing routers. To robustly balance performance and cost, we propose an exponential reward function that enhances stability across user preferences. The resulting architecture is lightweight, generalizes effectively across domains, and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to prior methods, establishing a new standard for cost-aware LLM routing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  KV Cache is commonly used to accelerate LLM inference with long contexts, yet its high memory demand drives the need for cache compression. Existing compression methods, however, are largely heuristic and lack dynamic budget allocation. To address this limitation, we introduce a unified framework for cache compression by minimizing information loss in Transformer residual streams. Building on it, we analyze the layer attention output loss and derive a new metric to compare cache entries across heads, enabling layer-wise compression with dynamic head budgets. Additionally, by contrasting cross-layer information, we also achieve dynamic layer budgets. LAVa is the first unified strategy for cache eviction and dynamic budget allocation that, unlike prior methods, does not rely on training or the combination of multiple strategies. Experiments with benchmarks (LongBench, Needle-In-A-Haystack, Ruler, and InfiniteBench) demonstrate its superiority. Moreover, our experiments reveal a new insight: dynamic layer budgets are crucial for generation tasks (e.g., code completion), while dynamic head budgets play a key role in extraction tasks (e.g., extractive QA). As a fully dynamic compression method, LAVa consistently maintains top performance across task types. Our code is available atthis https URL.

  Predicting cryptocurrency returns is notoriously difficult: price movements are driven by a fast-shifting blend of on-chain activity, news flow, and social sentiment, while labeled training data are scarce and expensive. In this paper, we present Meta-RL-Crypto, a unified transformer-based architecture that unifies meta-learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to create a fully self-improving trading agent. Starting from a vanilla instruction-tuned LLM, the agent iteratively alternates between three roles-actor, judge, and meta-judge-in a closed-loop architecture. This learning process requires no additional human supervision. It can leverage multimodal market inputs and internal preference feedback. The agent in the system continuously refines both the trading policy and evaluation criteria. Experiments across diverse market regimes demonstrate that Meta-RL-Crypto shows good performance on the technical indicators of the real market and outperforming other LLM-based baselines.

  _Leen Daher, Zhaobo Wang, Malcolm Mielle_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Cross-modal transfer learning is used to improve multi-modal classification models (e.g., for human activity recognition in human-robot collaboration). However, existing methods require paired sensor data at both training and inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments where full sensor suites are not economically and technically usable. To address this, we propose Decoupled Cross-Attention Transfer (D-CAT), a framework that aligns modality-specific representations without requiring joint sensor modality during inference. Our approach combines a self-attention module for feature extraction with a novel cross-attention alignment loss, which enforces the alignment of sensors' feature spaces without requiring the coupling of the classification pipelines of both modalities. We evaluate D-CAT on three multi-modal human activity datasets (IMU, video, and audio) under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, comparing against uni-modal models. Results show that in in-distribution scenarios, transferring from high-performing modalities (e.g., video to IMU) yields up to 10% F1-score gains over uni-modal training. In out-of-distribution scenarios, even weaker source modalities (e.g., IMU to video) improve target performance, as long as the target model isn't overfitted on the training data. By enabling single-sensor inference with cross-modal knowledge, D-CAT reduces hardware redundancy for perception systems while maintaining accuracy, which is critical for cost-sensitive or adaptive deployments (e.g., assistive robots in homes with variable sensor availability).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process, enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning, producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters, efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon, clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30% compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a very robust and versatile modelling framework for digital soil mapping in precision agriculture.

  We introduce open-sci-ref, a family of dense transformer models trained as research baselines across multiple model (0.13B to 1.7B parameters) and token scales (up to 1T) on 8 recent open reference datasets. Evaluating the models on various standardized benchmarks, our training runs set establishes reference points that enable researchers to assess the sanity and quality of alternative training approaches across scales and datasets. Intermediate checkpoints allow comparison and studying of the training dynamics. The established reference baselines allow training procedures to be compared through their scaling trends, aligning them on a common compute axis. Comparison of open reference datasets reveals that training on NemoTron-CC HQ consistently outperforms other reference datasets, followed by DCLM-baseline and FineWeb-Edu. In addition to intermediate training checkpoints, the release includes logs, code, and downstream evaluations to simplify reproduction, standardize comparison, and facilitate future research.

  Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins, yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines, demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases. We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and consistently outperforms prior work.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling paradigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also discover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query strategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on training or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better. We can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the queries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset. These findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the size should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke high-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, the result would be 90.0% on AIME24 and 80.0% on AIME25. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

  _Frederik L. Dennig, Daniel A. Keim_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy (DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

  AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce Medex, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing information in concise fair-use facts. Medex consists of 32.3 million pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e. SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM, CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). Medex is highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average. Models built with Medex can be used as constraints while optimizing for novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly as effective. We release our dataset atthis https URL, and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

  Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However, deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data enrichment in process prediction.

  In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient: clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI (XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their clinical actionable outcomes.

  The rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models has spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices. Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional Centralized Learning approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with data privacy concerns, regulatory restrictions, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast, Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating model updates rather than potentially private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labeled data, heterogeneous user activities, and trade-offs between personalization and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activities and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications. The results show that this reduces the overall redundant communications by 13%, while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible recognition cost by 1%. Thus, the FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and it is available as open source at:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for mitigating urban congestion, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods face challenges in scaling to large networks while maintaining global coordination. Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges. Experimental results show that HiLight exhibits significant advantages in large-scale scenarios and remains competitive across standard benchmarks of varying sizes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominant paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous, alternating generation and training in a batch setting where rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same model. This approach stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency: generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model updates, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a fully asynchronous RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves up to 2.77$\times$ training speedup compared to synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and ``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The bridge problem is to find an SDE (or sometimes an ODE) that bridges two given distributions. The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous, among which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional image generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr√∂dinger bridge problem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the bridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in the deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting algorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter specifically for the Schr√∂dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of this article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms with technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified perspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms (and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified framework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch) optimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr√∂dinger bridge FM algorithm, and the deep Schr√∂dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its special cases. We believe that this unified framework will be useful for viewing the bridge problems in a more general and flexible perspective, and in turn can help researchers and practitioners to develop new bridge algorithms in their fields.

  _Elias Kempf, Simon Schrodi, Max Argus, Thomas Brox_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Physical reasoning is a remarkable human ability that enables rapid learning and generalization from limited experience. Current AI models, despite extensive training, still struggle to achieve similar generalization, especially in Out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This limitation stems from their inability to abstract core physical principles from observations. A key challenge is developing representations that can efficiently learn and generalize physical dynamics from minimal data. Here we present Neural Force Field (NFF), a framework extending Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) to learn complex object interactions through force field representations, which can be efficiently integrated through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver to predict object trajectories. Unlike existing approaches that rely on discrete latent spaces, NFF captures fundamental physical concepts such as gravity, support, and collision in continuous explicit force fields. Experiments on three challenging physical reasoning tasks demonstrate that NFF, trained with only a few examples, achieves strong generalization to unseen scenarios. This physics-grounded representation enables efficient forward-backward planning and rapid adaptation through interactive refinement. Our work suggests that incorporating physics-inspired representations into learning systems can help bridge the gap between artificial and human physical reasoning capabilities.

  With the expansion of data availability, machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in both academia and industry. However, imbalanced data distributions are prevalent in various types of raw data and severely hinder the performance of ML by biasing the decision-making processes. To deepen the understanding of imbalanced data and facilitate the related research and applications, this survey systematically analyzes various real-world data formats and concludes existing researches for different data formats into four distinct categories: data re-balancing, feature representation, training strategy, and ensemble learning. This structured analysis helps researchers comprehensively understand the pervasive nature of imbalance across diverse data formats, thereby paving a clearer path toward achieving specific research goals. We provide an overview of relevant open-source libraries, spotlight current challenges, and offer novel insights aimed at fostering future advancements in this critical area of study.

  _Zahraa Al Sahili, Ioannis Patras, Matthew Purver_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Vision-language models (VLMs) deliver strong zero-shot recognition but frequently inherit social biases from their training data. We systematically disentangle three design factors -- model size, training-data scale, and training-data source -- by comparing CLIP and OpenCLIP, two models that share an identical contrastive objective yet differ in encoder width and in the image-text corpora on which they are pre-trained (400M proprietary pairs vs. 400M/2B LAION). Across balanced face-analysis benchmarks, enlarging the encoder reduces gender skew in CLIP but amplifies both gender and racial skew in OpenCLIP; increasing the LAION corpus from 400M to 2B further increases OpenCLIP bias. At matched model and data budgets, substituting proprietary data with LAION improves gender fairness while increasing racial skew, underscoring data source as the primary driver of bias patterns. We also evaluate three post-hoc, test-time debiasing strategies -- Bias Prompts, Prompt Array, and SANER. Debiasing reduces but does not eliminate harm, and its effectiveness is source- and size-dependent: Bias Prompts most effectively reduce gender skew in CLIP at smaller model sizes, whereas Prompt Array and SANER more reliably reduce racial skew in OpenCLIP; scaling LAION reconfigures which method is most fair. Taken together, these findings challenge the assumption that bigger models or datasets are automatically fairer and foreground training data source as the key determinant of both bias and mitigation efficacy. We release code and evaluation scripts to enable transparent, reproducible auditing of future VLMs.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  A common decision made by people, whether healthy or with health conditions, is choosing meals like breakfast, lunch, and dinner, comprising combinations of foods for appetizer, main course, side dishes, desserts, and beverages. Often, this decision involves tradeoffs between nutritious choices (e.g., salt and sugar levels, nutrition content) and convenience (e.g., cost and accessibility, cuisine type, food source type). We present a data-driven solution for meal recommendations that considers customizable meal configurations and time horizons. This solution balances user preferences while accounting for food constituents and cooking processes. Our contributions include introducing goodness measures, a recipe conversion method from text to the recently introduced multimodal rich recipe representation (R3) format, learning methods using contextual bandits that show promising preliminary results, and the prototype, usage-inspired, BEACON system.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Deploying neural networks on the edge has become increasingly important as deep learning is being applied in an increasing amount of applications. At the edge computing hardware typically has limited resources disallowing to run neural networks with high complexity. To reduce the complexity of neural networks a wide range of quantization methods have been proposed in recent years. This work proposes Constraint Guided Model Quantization (CGMQ), which is a quantization aware training algorithm that uses an upper bound on the computational resources and reduces the bit-widths of the parameters of the neural network. CGMQ does not require the tuning of a hyperparameter to result in a mixed precision neural network that satisfies the predefined computational cost constraint, while prior work does. It is shown on MNIST and CIFAR10 that the performance of CGMQ is competitive with state-of-the-art quantization aware training algorithms, while guaranteeing the satisfaction of an upper bound on the computational complexity defined by the computational resources of the on edge hardware.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce the Overcooked Generalisation Challenge (OGC) - a new benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) agents on their ability to cooperate with unknown partners in unfamiliar environments. Existing work typically evaluated cooperative RL only in their training environment or with their training partners, thus seriously limiting our ability to understand agents' generalisation capacity - an essential requirement for future collaboration with humans. The OGC extends Overcooked-AI to support dual curriculum design (DCD). It is fully GPU-accelerated, open-source, and integrated into the minimax DCD benchmark suite. Compared to prior DCD benchmarks, where designers manipulate only minimal elements of the environment, OGC introduces a significantly richer design space: full kitchen layouts with multiple objects that require the designer to account for interaction dynamics between agents. We evaluate state-of-the-art DCD algorithms alongside scalable neural architectures and find that current methods fail to produce agents that generalise effectively to novel layouts and unfamiliar partners. Our results indicate that both agents and curriculum designers struggle with the joint challenge of partner and environment generalisation. These findings establish OGC as a demanding testbed for cooperative generalisation and highlight key directions for future research. We open-source our code.

  Anomaly Detection (AD) is crucial in industrial settings to streamline operations by detecting underlying issues. Conventional methods merely label observations as normal or anomalous, lacking crucial insights. In Industry 5.0, interpretable outcomes become desirable to enable users to understand the rational under model decisions. This paper presents the first industrial application of ExIFFI, a recent approach for fast, efficient explanations for the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) (AD) method. ExIFFI is tested on three industrial datasets, demonstrating superior explanation effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art explainable AD models.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In the evolving field of machine learning, ensuring group fairness has become a critical concern, prompting the development of algorithms designed to mitigate bias in decision-making processes. Group fairness refers to the principle that a model's decisions should be equitable across different groups defined by sensitive attributes such as gender or race, ensuring that individuals from privileged groups and unprivileged groups are treated fairly and receive similar outcomes. However, achieving fairness in the presence of group-specific concept drift remains an unexplored frontier, and our research represents pioneering efforts in this regard. Group-specific concept drift refers to situations where one group experiences concept drift over time while another does not, leading to a decrease in fairness even if accuracy remains fairly stable. Within the framework of Federated Learning, where clients collaboratively train models, its distributed nature further amplifies these challenges since each client can experience group-specific concept drift independently while still sharing the same underlying concept, creating a complex and dynamic environment for maintaining fairness. The most significant contribution of our research is the formalization and introduction of the problem of group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart, shedding light on its critical importance in the field of fairness. Additionally, leveraging insights from prior research, we adapt an existing distributed concept drift adaptation algorithm to tackle group-specific distributed concept drift which uses a multi-model approach, a local group-specific drift detection mechanism, and continuous clustering of models over time. The findings from our experiments highlight the importance of addressing group-specific concept drift and its distributed counterpart to advance fairness in machine learning.

  _Tong Chen, Raghavendra Selvan_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Dataset Condensation (DC) refers to the recent class of dataset compression methods that generate a smaller, synthetic, dataset from a larger dataset. This synthetic dataset aims to retain the essential information of the original dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance levels comparable to those trained on the full dataset. Most current DC methods have mainly concerned with achieving high test performance with limited data budget, and have not directly addressed the question of adversarial robustness. In this work, we investigate the impact of adversarial robustness on models trained with compressed datasets. We show that the compressed datasets obtained from DC methods are not effective in transferring adversarial robustness to models. As a solution to improve dataset compression efficiency and adversarial robustness simultaneously, we present a robustness-aware dataset compression method based on finding the Minimal Finite Covering (MFC) of the dataset. The proposed method is (1) provably robust by minimizing the generalized adversarial loss, (2) more effective than DC methods when applying adversarial training over MFC, (3) obtained by a one-time computation and is applicable for any model.

  Adversarial attacks are a type of attack on machine learning models where an attacker deliberately modifies the inputs to cause the model to make incorrect predictions. Adversarial attacks can have serious consequences, particularly in applications such as autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and security systems. Work on the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial attacks has shown that it is very easy to make samples that make a model predict things that it doesn't want to. In this work, we analyze the impact of model interpretability due to adversarial attacks on text classification problems. We develop an ML-based classification model for text data. Then, we introduce the adversarial perturbations on the text data to understand the classification performance after the attack. Subsequently, we analyze and interpret the model's explainability before and after the attack

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The goal of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is to find a set of paths for a fleet of agents moving in a shared environment such that the agents reach their goals without colliding with each other. In practice, some of the robots executing the plan may get delayed, which can introduce collision risk. Although robust execution methods are used to ensure safety even in the presence of delays, the delays may still have a significant impact on the duration of the execution. At some point, the accumulated delays may become significant enough that instead of continuing with the execution of the original plan, even if it was optimal, there may now exist an alternate plan which will lead to a shorter execution. However, the problem is how to decide when to search for the alternate plan, since it is a costly procedure. In this paper, we propose a holistic architecture for robust execution of MAPF plans, its monitoring and optimization. We exploit a robust execution method called Action Dependency Graph to maintain an estimate of the expected execution duration during the plan's execution. This estimate is used to predict the potential that finding an alternate plan would lead to shorter execution. We empirically evaluate the architecture in experiments in a real-time simulator which we designed to mimic our real-life demonstrator of an autonomous warehouse robotic fleet.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Key global challenges of our times are characterized by complex interdependencies and can only be effectively addressed through an integrated, participatory effort. Conventional risk analysis frameworks often reduce complexity to ensure manageability, creating silos that hinder comprehensive solutions. A fundamental shift towards holistic strategies is essential to enable effective negotiations between different sectors and to balance the competing interests of stakeholders. However, achieving this balance is often hindered by limited time, vast amounts of information, and the complexity of integrating diverse perspectives. This study presents an AI-assisted negotiation framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) and AI-based autonomous agents into a negotiation-centered risk analysis workflow. The framework enables stakeholders to simulate negotiations, systematically model dynamics, anticipate compromises, and evaluate solution impacts. By leveraging LLMs' semantic analysis capabilities we could mitigate information overload and augment decision-making process under time constraints. Proof-of-concept implementations were conducted in two real-world scenarios: (i) prudent use of a biopesticide, and (ii) targeted wild animal population control. Our work demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted negotiation to address the current lack of tools for cross-sectoral engagement. Importantly, the solution's open source, web based design, suits for application by a broader audience with limited resources and enables users to tailor and develop it for their own needs.

  _Hang Yin, Haoyu Wei, Xiuwei Xu, Wenxuan Guo, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu_
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and autonomous navigation framework.

  Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) can enhance human capability within close proximity. However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its operation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments increase, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in reduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a motion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced Human-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular acceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the moment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and robotic system models.

  Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We present TASC, a Task-Aware Shared Control framework for teleoperated manipulation that infers task-level user intent and provides assistance throughout the task. To support everyday tasks without predefined knowledge, TASC constructs an open-vocabulary interaction graph from visual input to represent functional object relationships, and infers user intent accordingly. A shared control policy then provides rotation assistance during both grasping and object interaction, guided by spatial constraints predicted by a vision-language model. Our method addresses two key challenges in general-purpose, long-horizon shared control: (1) understanding and inferring task-level user intent, and (2) generalizing assistance across diverse objects and tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that TASC improves task efficiency and reduces user input effort compared to prior methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first shared control framework that supports everyday manipulation tasks with zero-shot generalization. The code that supports our experiments is publicly available atthis https URL.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We introduce a model for monocular RGB relative pose estimation of a ground robot that trains from scratch without pose labels nor prior knowledge about the robot's shape or appearance. At training time, we assume: (i) a robot fitted with multiple LEDs, whose states are independent and known at each frame; (ii) knowledge of the approximate viewing direction of each LED; and (iii) availability of a calibration image with a known target distance, to address the ambiguity of monocular depth estimation. Training data is collected by a pair of robots moving randomly without needing external infrastructure or human supervision. Our model trains on the task of predicting from an image the state of each LED on the robot. In doing so, it learns to predict the position of the robot in the image, its distance, and its relative bearing. At inference time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary, and does not affect the pose estimation performance. Quantitative experiments indicate that our approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from pose labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and handles multi-robot pose estimation.

  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with suspended payloads offer significant advantages for aerial transportation in complex and cluttered environments. However, existing systems face critical limitations, including unreliable perception of the cable-payload dynamics, inefficient planning in large-scale environments, and the inability to guarantee whole-body safety under cable bending and external disturbances. This paper presents Acetrans, an Autonomous, Corridor-based, and Efficient UAV suspended transport system that addresses these challenges through a unified perception, planning, and control framework. A LiDAR-IMU fusion module is proposed to jointly estimate both payload pose and cable shape under taut and bent modes, enabling robust whole-body state estimation and real-time filtering of cable point clouds. To enhance planning scalability, we introduce the Multi-size-Aware Configuration-space Iterative Regional Inflation (MACIRI) algorithm, which generates safe flight corridors while accounting for varying UAV and payload geometries. A spatio-temporal, corridor-constrained trajectory optimization scheme is then developed to ensure dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Finally, a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) augmented with cable-bending constraints provides robust whole-body safety during execution. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of Acetrans, demonstrating substantial improvements in perception accuracy, planning efficiency, and control safety compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  The work describes the development of a hybrid control architecture for an anthropomorphic tour guide robot, combining a multi-agent resource management system with automatic behavior scenario generation based on large language models. The proposed approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional systems, which rely on manual tuning of behavior scenarios. These limitations include manual configuration, low flexibility, and lack of naturalness in robot behavior. The process of preparing tour scenarios is implemented through a two-stage generation: first, a stylized narrative is created, then non-verbal action tags are integrated into the text. The multi-agent system ensures coordination and conflict resolution during the execution of parallel actions, as well as maintaining default behavior after the completion of main operations, contributing to more natural robot behavior. The results obtained from the trial demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for automating and scaling social robot control systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In dynamic and uncertain environments, robotic path planning demands accurate spatiotemporal environment understanding combined with robust decision-making under partial observability. However, current deep reinforcement learning-based path planning methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal adaptability in dynamic scenarios, and (2) inefficient exploration-exploitation balance, leading to degraded path quality. To address these challenges, we propose GundamQ: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Q-Network for Robotic Path Planning. The framework comprises two key modules: (i) the Spatiotemporal Perception module, which hierarchically extracts multi-granularity spatial features and multi-scale temporal dependencies ranging from instantaneous to extended time horizons, thereby improving perception accuracy in dynamic environments; and (ii) the Adaptive Policy Optimization module, which balances exploration and exploitation during training while optimizing for smoothness and collision probability through constrained policy updates. Experiments in dynamic environments demonstrate that GundamQ achieves a 15.3\% improvement in success rate and a 21.7\% increase in overall path quality, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

DiffAero supports both environment-level and agent-level parallelism and integrates multiple dynamics models, customizable sensor stacks (IMU, depth camera, and LiDAR), and diverse flight tasks within a unified, GPU-native training interface. By fully parallelizing both physics and rendering on the GPU, DiffAero eliminates CPU-GPU data transfer bottlenecks and delivers orders-of-magnitude improvements in simulation throughput. In contrast to existing simulators, DiffAero not only provides high-performance simulation but also serves as a research platform for exploring differentiable and hybrid learning algorithms.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Legged robots are promising candidates for exploring challenging areas on low-gravity bodies such as the Moon, Mars, or asteroids, thanks to their advanced mobility on unstructured terrain. However, as planetary robots' power and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a 15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy. Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.

  The increasing labor shortage and aging population underline the need for assistive robots to support human care recipients. To enable safe and responsive assistance, robots require accurate human motion prediction in physical interaction scenarios. However, this remains a challenging task due to the variability of assistive settings and the complexity of coupled dynamics in physical interactions. In this work, we address these challenges through two key contributions: (1) HHI-Assist, a dataset comprising motion capture clips of human-human interactions in assistive tasks; and (2) a conditional Transformer-based denoising diffusion model for predicting the poses of interacting agents. Our model effectively captures the coupled dynamics between caregivers and care receivers, demonstrating improvements over baselines and strong generalization to unseen scenarios. By advancing interaction-aware motion prediction and introducing a new dataset, our work has the potential to significantly enhance robotic assistance policies.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  This paper studies the kinematic tracking control problem for aerial manipulators. Existing kinematic tracking control methods, which typically employ proportional-derivative feedback or tracking-error-based feedback strategies, may fail to achieve tracking objectives within specified time constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel control framework comprising two key components: end-effector tracking control based on a user-defined preset trajectory and quadratic programming-based reference allocation. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method has several attractive features. First, it ensures that the end-effector reaches the desired position within a preset time while keeping the tracking error within a performance envelope that reflects task requirements. Second, quadratic programming is employed to allocate the references of the quadcopter base and the Delta arm, while considering the physical constraints of the aerial manipulator, thus preventing solutions that may violate physical limitations. The proposed approach is validated through three experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its capability to guarantee that the target position is reached within the preset time.

  Robot skill acquisition processes driven by reinforcement learning often rely on simulations to efficiently generate large-scale interaction data. However, the absence of simulation models for tactile sensors has hindered the use of tactile sensing in such skill learning processes, limiting the development of effective policies driven by tactile perception. To bridge this gap, we present TwinTac, a system that combines the design of a physical tactile sensor with its digital twin model. Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the physical sensor's outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensor's output. Furthermore, by conducting an object classification task, we showed that simulation data generated by our digital twin sensor can effectively augment real-world data, leading to improved accuracy. These results highlight TwinTac's potential to bridge the gap in cross-domain learning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Spherical robots offer unique advantages for mapping applications in hazardous or confined environments, thanks to their protective shells and omnidirectional mobility. This work presents two complementary spherical mapping systems: a lightweight, non-actuated design and an actuated variant featuring internal pendulum-driven locomotion. Both systems are equipped with a Livox Mid-360 solid-state LiDAR sensor and run LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) algorithms on resource-constrained hardware. We assess the mapping accuracy of these systems by comparing the resulting 3D point-clouds from the LIO algorithms to a ground truth map. The results indicate that the performance of state-of-the-art LIO algorithms deteriorates due to the high dynamic movement introduced by the spherical locomotion, leading to globally inconsistent maps and sometimes unrecoverable drift.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mechanical compliance is a key design parameter for dynamic contact-rich manipulation, affecting task success and safety robustness over contact geometry variation. Design of soft robotic structures, such as compliant fingers, requires choosing design parameters which affect geometry and stiffness, and therefore manipulation performance and robustness. Today, these parameters are chosen through either hardware iteration, which takes significant development time, or simplified models (e.g. planar), which can't address complex manipulation task objectives. Improvements in dynamic simulation, especially with contact and friction modeling, present a potential design tool for mechanical compliance. We propose a simulation-based design tool for compliant mechanisms which allows design with respect to task-level objectives, such as success rate. This is applied to optimize design parameters of a structured compliant finger to reduce failure cases inside a tolerance window in insertion tasks. The improvement in robustness is then validated on a real robot using tasks from the benchmark NIST task board. The finger stiffness affects the tolerance window: optimized parameters can increase tolerable ranges by a factor of 2.29, with workpiece variation up to 8.6 mm being compensated. However, the trends remain task-specific. In some tasks, the highest stiffness yields the widest tolerable range, whereas in others the opposite is observed, motivating need for design tools which can consider application-specific geometry and dynamics.

  Ensuring the safe and reliable operation of robotic systems is paramount to prevent potential disasters and safeguard human well-being. Despite rigorous design and engineering practices, these systems can still experience malfunctions, leading to safety risks. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach for detecting anomalies in system logs to enhance the safety and reliability of robotic systems. We collected logs from two distinct scenarios using CoppeliaSim and comparatively evaluated several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an Autoencoder. Our system was evaluated in a quadcopter context (Context 1) and a Pioneer robot context (Context 2). Results showed that while LR demonstrated superior performance in Context 1, the Autoencoder model proved to be the most effective in Context 2. This highlights that the optimal model choice is context-dependent, likely due to the varying complexity of anomalies across different robotic platforms. This research underscores the value of a comparative approach and demonstrates the particular strengths of autoencoders for detecting complex anomalies in robotic systems.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot agents; however, standard approaches typically require substantial data acquisition -- via numerous demonstrations or random exploration -- to ensure reliable performance. Although exploration reduces human effort, it lacks safety guarantees and often results in frequent collisions -- particularly in clearance-limited tasks (e.g., peg-in-hole) -- thereby, necessitating manual environmental resets and imposing additional human burden. This study proposes Self-Augmented Robot Trajectory (SART), a framework that enables policy learning from a single human demonstration, while safely expanding the dataset through autonomous augmentation. SART consists of two stages: (1) human teaching only once, where a single demonstration is provided and precision boundaries -- represented as spheres around key waypoints -- are annotated, followed by one environment reset; (2) robot self-augmentation, where the robot generates diverse, collision-free trajectories within these boundaries and reconnects to the original demonstration. This design improves the data collection efficiency by minimizing human effort while ensuring safety. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world manipulation tasks show that SART achieves substantially higher success rates than policies trained solely on human-collected demonstrations.

  Infancy is characterized by rapid body growth and an explosive change of sensory and motor abilities. However, developmental robots and simulation platforms are typically designed in the image of a specific age, which limits their ability to capture the changing abilities and constraints of developing infants. To address this issue, we present MIMo v2, a new version of the multimodal infant model. It includes a growing body with increasing actuation strength covering the age range from birth to 24 months. It also features foveated vision with developing visual acuity as well as sensorimotor delays modeling finite signal transmission speeds to and from an infant's brain. Further enhancements of this MIMo version include an inverse kinematics module, a random environment generator and updated compatiblity with third-party simulation and learning libraries. Overall, this new MIMo version permits increased realism when modeling various aspects of sensorimotor development. The code is available on the official repository (this https URL).

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  We aim to enable humanoid robots to efficiently solve new manipulation tasks from a few video examples. In-context learning (ICL) is a promising framework for achieving this goal due to its test-time data efficiency and rapid adaptability. However, current ICL methods rely on labor-intensive teleoperated data for training, which restricts scalability. We propose using human play videos -- continuous, unlabeled videos of people interacting freely with their environment -- as a scalable and diverse training data source. We introduce MimicDroid, which enables humanoids to perform ICL using human play videos as the only training data. MimicDroid extracts trajectory pairs with similar manipulation behaviors and trains the policy to predict the actions of one trajectory conditioned on the other. Through this process, the model acquired ICL capabilities for adapting to novel objects and environments at test time. To bridge the embodiment gap, MimicDroid first retargets human wrist poses estimated from RGB videos to the humanoid, leveraging kinematic similarity. It also applies random patch masking during training to reduce overfitting to human-specific cues and improve robustness to visual differences. To evaluate few-shot learning for humanoids, we introduce an open-source simulation benchmark with increasing levels of generalization difficulty. MimicDroid outperformed state-of-the-art methods and achieved nearly twofold higher success rates in the real world. Additional materials can be found on:this http URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible. To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities. Project page:this https URL

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed, and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust performance.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion, especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance compared to two baseline controllers.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain. However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1. Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions. Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments, significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments, our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior kinematic knowledge.

  Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency. While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions. Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then, it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained robotic platforms.

  Tactile sensing is crucial for achieving human-level robotic capabilities in manipulation tasks. As a promising solution, Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) offer high spatial resolution and cost-effectiveness, but present unique challenges in robotics for their complex physical characteristics and visual signal processing requirements. The lack of efficient and accurate simulation tools for VBTSs has significantly limited the scale and scope of tactile robotics research. We present Taccel, a high-performance simulation platform that integrates IPC and ABD to model robots, tactile sensors, and objects with both accuracy and unprecedented speed, achieving an 18-fold acceleration over real-time across thousands of parallel environments. Unlike previous simulators that operate at sub-real-time speeds with limited parallelization, Taccel provides precise physics simulation and realistic tactile signals while supporting flexible robot-sensor configurations through user-friendly APIs. Through extensive validation in object recognition, robotic grasping, and articulated object manipulation, we demonstrate precise simulation and successful sim-to-real transfer. These capabilities position Taccel as a powerful tool for scaling up tactile robotics research and development, potentially transforming how robots interact with and understand their physical environment.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  B* is a novel optimization framework that addresses a critical challenge in fixed-base manipulator robotics: optimal base placement. Current methods rely on pre-computed kinematics databases generated through sampling to search for solutions. However, they face an inherent trade-off between solution optimality and computational efficiency when determining sampling resolution. To address these limitations, B* unifies multiple objectives without database dependence. The framework employs a two-layer hierarchical approach. The outer layer systematically manages terminal constraints through progressive tightening, particularly for base mobility, enabling feasible initialization and broad solution exploration. The inner layer addresses non-convexities in each outer-layer subproblem through sequential local linearization, converting the original problem into tractable sequential linear programming (SLP). Testing across multiple robot platforms demonstrates B*'s effectiveness. The framework achieves solution optimality five orders of magnitude better than sampling-based approaches while maintaining perfect success rates and reduced computational overhead. Operating directly in configuration space, B* enables simultaneous path planning with customizable optimization criteria. B* serves as a crucial initialization tool that bridges the gap between theoretical motion planning and practical deployment, where feasible trajectory existence is fundamental.

  Developing robotic hands that adapt to real-world dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and machine intelligence. Despite significant advances in replicating human hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (p<0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering new perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behavior.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robotic manipulation research has investigated contact-rich problems and strategies that require robots to intentionally collide with their environment, to accomplish tasks that cannot be handled by traditional collision-free solutions. By enabling compliant robot motions, collisions between the robot and its environment become more tolerable and can thus be exploited, but more physical uncertainties are introduced. To address contact-rich problems such as occluded object grasping while handling the involved uncertainties, we propose a collision-inclusive planning framework that can transition the robot to a desired task configuration via roughly modeled collisions absorbed by Cartesian impedance control. By strategically exploiting the environmental constraints and exploring inside a manipulation funnel formed by task repetitions, our framework can effectively reduce physical and perception uncertainties. With real-world evaluations on both single-arm and dual-arm setups, we show that our framework is able to efficiently address various realistic occluded grasping problems where a feasible grasp does not initially exist.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) provides substantial benefits over traditional open and laparoscopic methods. However, a significant limitation of RAMIS is the surgeon's inability to palpate tissues, a crucial technique for examining tissue properties and detecting abnormalities, restricting the widespread adoption of RAMIS. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce MiniTac, a novel vision-based tactile sensor with an ultra-compact cross-sectional diameter of 8 mm, designed for seamless integration into mainstream RAMIS devices, particularly the Da Vinci surgical systems. MiniTac features a novel mechanoresponsive photonic elastomer membrane that changes color distribution under varying contact pressures. This color change is captured by an embedded miniature camera, allowing MiniTac to detect tumors both on the tissue surface and in deeper layers typically obscured from endoscopic view. MiniTac's efficacy has been rigorously tested on both phantoms and ex-vivo tissues. By leveraging advanced mechanoresponsive photonic materials, MiniTac represents a significant advancement in integrating tactile sensing into RAMIS, potentially expanding its applicability to a wider array of clinical scenarios that currently rely on traditional surgical approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  Nonprehensile actions such as pushing are crucial for addressing multi-object rearrangement problems. Many traditional methods generate robot-centric actions, which differ from intuitive human strategies and are typically inefficient. To this end, we adopt an object-centric planning paradigm and propose a unified framework for addressing a range of large-scale, physics-intensive nonprehensile rearrangement problems challenged by modeling inaccuracies and real-world uncertainties. By assuming each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, our planner first computes desired object motions, which are then realized through robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric planning framework can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency. In addition, we propose a benchmarking protocol to standardize and facilitate future research in nonprehensile rearrangement.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
  With the emergence of new flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV) designs, a need for extensive and advanced mission capabilities arises. FWMAVs try to adapt and emulate the flight features of birds and flying insects. While current designs already achieve high manoeuvrability, they still almost entirely lack perching and take-off abilities. These capabilities could, for instance, enable long-term monitoring and surveillance missions, and operations in cluttered environments or in proximity to humans and animals. We present the development and testing of a framework that enables repeatable perching and take-off for small to medium-sized FWMAVs, utilising soft, non-damaging grippers. Thanks to its novel active-passive actuation system, an energy-conserving state can be achieved and indefinitely maintained while the vehicle is perched. A prototype of the proposed system weighing under 39 g was manufactured and extensively tested on a 110 g flapping-wing robot. Successful free-flight tests demonstrated the full mission cycle of landing, perching and subsequent take-off. The telemetry data recorded during the flights yields extensive insight into the system's behaviour and is a valuable step towards full automation and optimisation of the entire take-off and landing cycle.

  Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air aerial platforms, offer extended operational duration and enhanced safety in human-robot interactions due to their buoyant lift. However, achieving robust flight performance under environmental airflow disturbances remains a critical challenge, thereby limiting their broader deployment. Inspired by avian flight mechanics, particularly the ability of birds to perch and stabilize in turbulent wind conditions, this article introduces RGBlimp-Q -- a robotic gliding blimp equipped with a bird-inspired continuum arm featuring a novel moving mass actuation mechanism. This continuum arm enables flexible attitude regulation through internal mass redistribution, significantly enhancing the system's resilience to external disturbances. In addition, it facilitates aerial manipulation by employing end-effector claws that interact with the environment in a manner analogous to avian perching behavior. This article presents the design, modeling, and prototyping of RGBlimp-Q, supported by comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative analysis. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the first interdisciplinary integration of continuum mechanisms into a lighter-than-air robotic platform, where the continuum arm simultaneously functions as both an actuation and manipulation module. This design establishes a novel paradigm for robotic blimps, expanding their applicability to complex and dynamic environments.

  Integrating robots into human-centric environments such as homes, necessitates advanced manipulation skills as robotic devices will need to engage with articulated objects like doors and drawers. Key challenges in robotic manipulation of articulated objects are the unpredictability and diversity of these objects' internal structures, which render models based on object kinematics priors, both explicit and implicit, inadequate. Their reliability is significantly diminished by pre-interaction ambiguities, imperfect structural parameters, encounters with unknown objects, and unforeseen disturbances. Here, we present a prior-free strategy, Tac-Man, focusing on maintaining stable robot-object contact during manipulation. Without relying on object priors, Tac-Man leverages tactile feedback to enable robots to proficiently handle a variety of articulated objects, including those with complex joints, even when influenced by unexpected disturbances. Demonstrated in both real-world experiments and extensive simulations, it consistently achieves near-perfect success in dynamic and varied settings, outperforming existing methods. Our results indicate that tactile sensing alone suffices for managing diverse articulated objects, offering greater robustness and generalization than prior-based approaches. This underscores the importance of detailed contact modeling in complex manipulation tasks, especially with articulated objects. Advancements in tactile-informed approaches significantly expand the scope of robotic applications in human-centric environments, particularly where accurate models are difficult to obtain.
